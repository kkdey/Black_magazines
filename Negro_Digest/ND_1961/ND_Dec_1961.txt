a voice crying in the south african wilderness
by peter ritner
four african lawyers who happened to be christian founded the african national congress in 1912 at that time of course the south african government was still paternally guided by the imperial parliament in london therefore an appeal to the consciences of the coalition of englishspeakers and moderate afrikaners who ran the country on the spot but which was utlimately responsible to an enlightened upper class in england seemed to promise the best chance of success the principle of operation was publicity vividly present the africans plight to these europeans the theory ranmake them feel in their bones the misery of the african and their best instincts will take over and right the perennial wrongs such a campaign of publicity has continued to be the main principle of congress operations but the audience which was meant to profit by it has sadly deteriorated the imperial parliament has vanished with the kingdom of 4 hanover the englishspeakers in south africa have quite lost their victorian religion without having lost the taste for creature comforts and the publicity which the congress has in mind is thrown away on the afrikaner he already knows everything about the plight of the african for he created it today the presidentgeneral of the african national congress is an extremely captivating and nobleminded man chief albert luthuli the only african who is a true national figure in the country the chief is an individual of subtle nuance of personality he is one of those rare beings who commands a spiritual alchemy which changes peace and brotherhood into concepts that seem to be as exciting as war and servitude now in his seventies stricken with heart disease the chief is writing the epilogue of a lifetime spent in trying to rouse the european to see the reasonableness of our case long ago when the northern africa for the africans leaders were still in their cradles before they had become presidents and prime ministers the chief was already a leader of his people he has failed to lead them to a land of milk and honey but this is a failure he has never conceded and at the same time he has never modified the modesty and the finality of his political aims full participation of the african in the government and control of their future he is undoubtedly the only african politician on the continent who would deny himself the pleasure of devouring the afrikaner alive for he is a christian and a noble who lives up to all his faiths at once but naturally he neither expects nor receives any gratitude from the afrikaners they have deposed him however his people and the new chief connive at flouting this deposition arrested him persecuted him insulted him and beaten him in his lifetime the chiefs position as spokesman for the congress and for the urban africans of south africa will never be challenged but the chief himself is the first to admit that the working leadership of the movement the secretariat in johannesburg has been forced by the outrageous bellicosity of afrikanerdom to veer far to the left of the traditional congress standthe stand to which the chief is personally committed men can be chewed up just so much and the chief has little enough to show for thirty negro digest december 1961 years of waiting around for european reasonableness to assert itself if the congress means to capture the loyalties of younger africans which of course it must do if it intends to remain effective it must meet on new ground the new poles of african events the diehardism in south africa and the new freedom in northern africa but inevitable innovations in programing have not reduced the chief to a figurehead he is too wise to begrudge the younger generation its right to chart a new path and in his heart he suspects i would guess that as a younger man facing the apartheid of the midcentury he too would bend his convictions so he has not simply retired from the fray but has used his prestige to construct for himself something like the constitutional position of the british queen he reminds and warns the officials and young warhawks of his party of the realities of life when their zeal seems to be overpowering their good sense specifically he tells his subordinates that the congress is not yet powerful enough for a big move organization on the reserves and the farms hardly exists at all and even in the cities party discipline is rudimentary when a chord in the africans soul is plucked in just the right way he is capable of a stubbornness and solidarity that are sensational such a phenomenon could be seen operating at the time of the johannesburg bus boycott of 1957 but this boycott was not a nationwide thing and it was more a spontaneous outburst than a congress offensive whether it is to be party or conspiracy the congress has far to go before it has honed itself into a true political instrument when the chief tires of reminding his collaborators that they must make themselves into a political party before they can hope to achieve the aims of a political club he turns to his second theme and that is that when and if blood begins to flow in south africa most of it will spill from black bodies not white ones the european is outnumbered four to one in south africa this is a sizable gap but not sizable enough so that the africans can deal with their enemies by drowning them in spit as gandhi once threatened to drown the english in india behind the afrikaners seemingly suicidal policy of leaving the african no alternative but violence there is a countervailing afrikaner readiness even eagerness to commit violence on the african to wind up the whole tortuous business to a climax the afrikaner youth is armed and drilled from the time he enters adolescence and trained in local militias the afrikaner government possesses jet planes and tanks and phosphorus bombs and the other impedimenta of modern 6 war and the afrikaner is sick of the african sick of his own vitalseating sickness he is sick of the shroud of melancholy and guilt which the thousands of africans of his day to day experience are wrapping around his soul he is sick of accusing rags and protruding ribs sick of the unconquerable presumption of men who ought not to think of themselves as men but in falling a victim to this fearful and reckless belligerence the afrikaner is summoning up out of the depths of african personality a complementary yearning for the consummation of violence doordieism increasingly will be the byword of young africans a historical horror is being compounded right before the old chiefs eyes and i suspect that the disastrous courses of the past decade have finally throttled all his hopes and optimism that it can be avoided but chief luthuli will go to his death preaching against a racial war of extermination and to the end he will conceive it to be his minimum duty to his people to warn them of the high blood price of freedom government regards him as the strongest and most dangerous thorn in its side like prime minister verwoerd luthuli was a college teacher before he turned to politics teaching at a small missionrun college for the bantu in 1936 he left the quiet academic life for the more turbulent world of politics when his tribe elected him to be chief of its small reserve of 5000 people chief luthulis duties combined those of administrator lawgiver and father confessor he would as he recalls sit under a shady tree and decide everything from questions regarding the dowry of a bride to marketing the tribes sugar cane crop most efficiently in the 1940s luthuli became active in the swelling bantu campaign to lower south africas color bars later as an official of the african national congress the chief bantu political organization he toured south africa urging nonviolent resistance to apartheid the nationalist government tried to curb luthulis growing influence first it dismissed him from his position as chief the bantu retaliated by electing him president of the african national congress the government struck back by banning luthuli from all large cities for a year later it confined him to his native village for two years shortly after this ban was up luthuli was arrested for treason for taking part in campaigns against existing laws before his case came to trial however the charges were dropped since last may the government has kept him confined to his home province of natal luthulis aides say he still believes that the best way to get results is through nonviolent resistance and through roundtable negotiations 
what colonialism did to africa

he african problem is both simple and complex and many nations groups and parties are facing the kind of new problems with which guinea is now faced africa is a geographical and a human entity but both morally and spiritually it is more diverse than any other it is therefore essential to discuss the problems that have to be solved in that context it is impossible for me either in writing or in lectures to present these problems objectively but it is possible to present a context though it will necessarily contribute an incomplete image of my country a country that some of you probably knew before i was born the essential factor that i want to bring out is the extent to which we in africa are conditioned by our way of life our country is backward and has gone through three distinct stages first there was the stage of precolonization in which our organization was communal each group had its own customs its own concepts of economic organization its own philosophy it had its own sketchy form of civilization but the important thing is that this civilization was our own like other parts of the world our countries knew insecurity and famine and went through the kind of struggle which is common to the whole human race to satisfy their material and moral needs people had to use what means they found at hand they had few contacts with the outside world in the second stage with the arrival of outsiders these contacts were established at first they were economic then social cultural and political during this period our original way of life was interrupted and modified by our contact with other civilizations sometimes the evolution characteristic of the first stage was arrested sometimes it became more dynamic in any case life was changed above all it was diverted from its normal course in my grandparents time ethnic language and tribal divisions gave way to divisions on a territorial basis african lands became colonies whose frontiers no longer respected the natural divisions which though not watertight had formerlywhether for instance in senegal in sudan or in guineahad a real existence these countries are inhabited by the same races and have the same civilization their essential characteristics are those of the entire african continent but the colonizers had their own methods the first change that they made the modification of frontiers was a negative contribution the second the linking of the african economy to the world economy was more dynamic it brought many changes it helped to increase markets and provided more social opportunities yet social development could not progress very far because the natural basis the popular basis was lacking the new social organization also created new problems education brought us into contact with new cultures a certain number of us assimilated the civilization of other countries and the result was that africa became culturally divided may i quote a personal example i find myself more at home with french friends than with my own elder brother who has never been to school colonization meant that opportunities of advancement were open to a small african elite but the cost was the creation of deep divisions between us materially there was progress but the happiness of man does not come merely from material things it comes from the harmonious development of material and spiritual elements the risk was that a moral vacuum would be created that we should become declasses educated but at home nowhere this is the negative contribution of colonialism evolution which in the precolonial era was vertical now became horizontal the different areas of africa evolved inharmoniously along different lines it was a period of unification military administrative and cultural unification when laws were applied throughout a whole territory the result was to create a positive sense of belonging to a larger community than that of the family or the tribe but it also had the negative result that the unified system was illadapted to meet the real diversity of needs there was a consequent distortion during this phase individual africans benefited from new possibilities of evolution at first they welcomed assimilation because education revealed new horizons but these horizons were always receding the original aim was to achieve equality between rulers and ruled but too often africans found say when elected to the assembly that their problems were as far as ever from a solution another phase followed during which trade unions students associations exservicemens organizations cultural organizations and political parties were formed they constituted an affirmation of the african personality this is not a complete picture but it is a picture of something that we feel deeply even if we cannot always express these feelings articulately there followed a third stage in which we realized that individual expressions of our personality were not enough we had to find collective forms of association because as individuals we could not achieve our objective which was the expression of the african personality this stage is the most important but the most difficult to describe africans believe that the dynamic period of colonialism gave africa a positive means of action our struggle for independence is not negative we want to retain the positive contribution of colonialism the increased contacts and the increased possibilities of exchange that it brought but we want to eliminate its negative aspects africa has we believe potentialities for economic expansion and we believe that independence will be a factor making for stabilization we do not believe that independence will bring a paradise on earth we are conscious of our need to unite and independence is for us a means to that end we are realists we want to increase our understanding of and our cooperation with other peoples to liquidate the disequilibrium that has been created in africa man as a human being must fulfil himself if we cannot create the necessary conditions for ourselves we must create them for those who will come after us this is the real moving force of african nationalism you can afford to oppose nationalism because you have gone through this stage we have not that is the tragedy of our situation what we want is to have laws that are the expression of our own people and this they have not always been an imposed system however good it may be is never valued as much as one that one has created for oneself what is lacking is human dignity of course we in guinea have our problems our country includes many tribes speaking some twenty different languages this is a problem which has to be tackled it is no good shutting ones eyes to the fact of our internal divisions it is better to tackle them head on we must organize the country at first there has naturally been opposition but in two or three or five years our people will have forgotten this we want to be responsible for our own lives one can always give ones brother good advice but he may prefer to make his own mistakes that is the african psychology and it is another reason why we are nationalists whatever people may say nationalism is psychologically inevitable and we are all nationalists what we africans are seeking is justice and equality let me give you an example of what i mean an employer may decide to pay a wage of 1000 francs even though he knows that the minimum wage is only 500 francs everybody will be happy at getting double the rate but if there is inequality between one worker and another the whole relationship within the group will be affected this is a human problem that the employer does not understand he sees only that he is paying double rates but what the african is interested in is equality at the present time we are also seeking liberty because it is a moral force we want to say what we please but improperly used this liberty can be dangerous we must be sure that we are facing the facts however disagreeable they may be if problems are not properly presented then things will go badly because we shall not have the conviction to overcome our problems on the whole we have the same aims we all believe in trade unionism but we have all understood that trade union action alone is not enough we must use it as a political as well as an economic weapon these are two facets of what is really the same purpose the first problem we have to tackle is the general one of organizing unified political action through trade unions particular problems can come later formerly we were divided some of us were in unions affiliated to the wftu some in christian unions some in those affiliated to the icftu i was myself a member of the cgt which was affiliated to the wftu but we wanted a united african movement taking no account of racial differences a movement whose primary aim would be the achievement of independence and whose secondary objective would be the safeguarding of the interests of the workers you will note that i put the political aim first and that we are seeking to achieve it through the trade unions that is an expression of our psychology at the present time all our trade unions are now political and all are working for independencein togoland and throughout the former territories of west and equatorial africa we also include some trade unions from british territories which were formerly affiliated to the icftu but which at the last conference of the union generate du travail dafrique noire decided in principle to join us a trade union leader from ghana has been made vicepresident some moroccan and tunisian trade unions also decided at conakry on union with us we do not want this to be a negative organization we want to make a positive contribution towards the development of our countries and we realize that ideological quarrels will not help we must have a concrete programme and fight for it actively we have drawn up our programme in cooperation with trade unions throughout the world we exclude none any trade union is free to send representatives to guinea to discuss our problems with us and if they can help us so much the better at present europe is busy setting up the common market and is anxious to include africa in it we say no we constitute at present too small a market we must first increase our own free market we have nothing against anyone but we prefer freely negotiated agreements and we think it is more honest to say so we are underpopulated and economically backward it is better for us to exploit what we have and to cooperate with anyone who will work with us there are various ways in which we can serve the cause of liberty the most important is in our own country independence is a means to an end and that end is security if we fail to work for that we betray the cause of liberty we are responsible to those for whom we work our aim must be the welfare of our population at the time the loicadre was voted ie 1956 we already used it differently from other territories we sought to create a new mentality if we voted no ie in the 1958 constitutional referendum the reason was precisely that we had developed a new outlook that we had confidence in our own future    here are some examples of what we have done since we became independent first we have got rid of antiquated customs in our villages the tribal chiefs were exploiting them for their own ends and so they had ceased to fufil any useful function people were no longer free what we have done is to appeal to the people themselves as against the chief we instituted elected councils and so transformed the village a third of the seats on village councils are reserved for women and many villages have women mayors second we have set up district councils elected by universal suffrage all who are over 21 have the right to vote a district normally includes from 200 to 300 villages peasants are allotted six seats in every ten so that on a council with 40 seats 24 will go to the peasants the educated have no advantage over the uneducated before independence there were twelve parties in guinea today there is a national front a single party the guinea democratic party those who say that i am a dictator because we have only one party and no opposition do not understand what we are trying to do the party is not an end but a means towards the end which is human freedom at first there was a great deal of disagreement and there was criticism too from outside people said the system would not work but it does and it works democratically in the village all are equal and the majority decides and this has created confidence intellectuals have no privileges all problems are discussed so that everybody can learn to feel that he belongs to the one nation that guinea belongs to us all if you think that this is a dictatorship come and see for yourselves there have been no political trials since independence there is opposition but it is expressed within the party and not from outside this is a different approach because our peasants and workers are practical people who are interested above all in concrete problems we do not discuss marxism but whether to build a bridge or a school and whether to build it here or there one thing we have achieved in guinea is personal security i can quote you one example of this a frenchman i know told me that he felt safer in guinea than he did in certain districts of paris one of our problems is economic development investment is encouraged and our method has been to call a congress of all our organizations throughout guinea and to explain to the delegates exactly what the new plans are and what the consequences would be we explained that at first some 5000 workers would be needed for the new projects but that later on all but about 400 would become redundant and that there was a danger of inflation the result was that when we signed the agreement we all knew what to expect and so nobody could blame us afterwards when the expected consequences materialized at this point m sekou toure interrupted his address in order to provide time for questions among the questions asked were the following qwhat would be the consequences if an opposition were to decide that it wanted to have a separate existence outside the party m sekou toure there is perfect freedom under our constitution for opposition parties to exist but at the last election 91 per cent of the population voted for the guinea democratic party the opposition mustered only 56 per cent of the votes and finally decided to rejoin our party there was reconciliation and two of their leaders were given responsible posts in fact the opposition viewpoint can be much more effectively put from within the party than from outside we are not all agreed inside the party but we express our opinions honestly and in good faith qwhat are the relations of guinea with the cote divoire with ghana and with other african states  m sekou toure our relations with ghana are intimate we have had a number of contacts and we shall have further meetings at which decisions will be taken with the cote divoire we have no official relations between our two governments but relations between our peoples are friendly we are also on good terms with other african states qwhat are your own chief resources and what are your chief needs from abroad m sekou toure in a year we have reduced personal taxes by half but national union has enabled us to do far more in the past year than we could have done if we had remained divided each village constitutes an independent sector responsible for taking its own decisions it has its own programme necessarily modest the village decides whether to build a school or a dispensary and so on this imposes no charge on the national budget because our resources are human the work is completed in two to three months in this way we have constructed 8000 kilometres of roads and built 500 schools hundreds of dispensaries and a number of bridges if the village decides to build a road which involves the destruction of somebodys property that property is always rebuilt by the village if there is a fireand that can easily happen as our houses are of strawthe whole village cooperates in the reconstruction our chief capital is human 
the strange musical genius of blind tom
by walter monfried
f iftythree years have passed since the death of that most astounding and mysterious of musical prodigies known as blind toma babbling imbecile who could play the piano like an angel upon hearing of toms demise the famous louisville editor marse henry watterson observed  i must be his oldest living friend i cannot trust myself to write of him as i feel it is as if some trusty well loved mastiff mute but affectionatehad been taken away what was he whence came he blind deformed black    the idiocy of a perpetual frenzy was the sole companion of his waking visions    that there was a soul there be sure imprisoned chained in that little black bosom released at last blind tom refuses to be forgotten he bobs up again and again in the public prints this month he receives another high honor he is included in a new supplement to groves dictionary of music and musicians the outstanding encyclopedia of its kind in english the entry begins bethune thomas greene born muscogee county georgia usa may 25 1849 died hoboken n j june 13 1908 american negro musical prodigy known as blind tom  how good a player was tom at 17 he moved a baltimore journalist john law to declare i may say without the slightest exaggeration that toms execution of all kinds of musicfrom the classical works of beethoven bach mendelssohn and others down to the simplest plantation melodyis unsurpassed by that of the best performers of the day he was still only 17 when on a european tour he was heard by the celebrated pedagogues ignaz 16 moscheles of vienna and prof h s oakley of edinburgh they called him a wonder of nature all discriminating reviewers agreed that tom had marvelous facility and memory but that he lacked originality of interpretation he could reproduce only what he had heard one may speculate on what he would have done in a phonographic age with gieseking and horowitz for models tom was the 21st child of his mother a slave his parents were unlettered field hands but surely with music in their souls when he was a babe in arms his mother went upon the block and was sold to gen thomas greene bethune owner of a plantation near columbus ga the child was thrown in for nothing because he was sightless and of low mentality from infancy he revealed an overpowering passion for music at the age of 2 he would creep up on the bethune porch and listen to the girls singing inside even then he was a remarkable mimic he could sing whatever he had heard and in the manner of the singer high or low male or female when tom was 4 the bethunes acquired a piano tom was playing near the house spinning about on his hands and heels a lifetime recreation of his when he first heard the strange new sounds he was entranced he hid in the bushes around the porch and stayed there until the girls left the piano room then he stole in found the keyboard and duplicated the sounds he had heard tom always roamed by night he would sneak out of his mothers cabin and wander for hours  when he returned he would emulate vocally the noises of storms rustling leaves cattle and so on at other times he would steal into the bethune parlor at midnight and play the piano until dawn the bethunes immediately recognized his gift and encouraged it the oldest daughter a fairly good pianist started to teach him but soon discovered that he could do everything she knew and much better then gen bethune engaged the communitys best players and teachers to work with the boy and again tom showed he could duplicate anything he had heard when tom was 8 his owner took him on tour at louisville he was heard by a showman william henry palmer an excellent pianist who also was a professional magician under the name of heller palmer realized that here was a first rate attraction he began to enlarge toms repertory he played many pieces for him and tom played them back more expertly than his mentor and what tom learned he never forgot henry watterson was a 19 year old reporter when he first heard tom then aged 10 watterson himself was a pianist of talent but a hand injury and partial blindness ended his keyboard studies he remained a lifelong lover of music at first hearing watterson was dumfounded by toms abilities and eccentricities and he never ceased to marvel at them in his memoirs written many years later he recalled  tom had heard stephen douglas speak in congress and he could repeat many of the sentences after he heard a soprano he repeated her songs a tennessee baritone taught him rocked in the cradle of the deep a tenor in griffin ga taught him some love songs tom could duplicate all of them his imitations from bass to soprano were startlingly lifelike he was blind and clearly an idiot in short he was a prodigy when another pianist was playing tom would spin about like a baboon as watterson put it when his turn came he pounced upon the instrument and tried to play what he had heard two or three lessons were enough for him to learn a short piece tom had unusual powers of improvisation too after the civil war tom chose to remain with the bethunes who always were kind to him in his 40 year concert career under their direction he earned 200000 about 5000 a year when the costs of travel lessons and escorts are considered it is obvious that no one profited heavily on his prowess toms vaudeville act was truly unusual he sang in several registers in addition to playing the piano as a windup he stood with his back to the keyboard played a hornpipe with one hand and with the other he pounded out patriotic airs on the piano then members of the audience were invited to the stage and asked to play anything several would respond and offer little numbers tom emulated readily in philadelphia when tom was 37 the invitation to the audience was accepted by anna amalie tutein a concert pianist and teacher she played a difficult excerpt from a beethoven concerto and tom was stumped the bethunes realized that tom had a lot to learn and hired mme tutein to instruct him at 5 a lessona sizable fee in the 1880s it was a distasteful task mme tutein recalled long afterward tom had grown fat he literally ate like a hog and he fought fiercely against being washed and bathed i must dispel the idea that tom could repeat anything after having heard it once she related the lessons were two hours long and it was often necessary for me to play the compositions 50 times before he would acquire them i would feed him 8 or 10 measures at a time then he would play them over several times and we would go on with others after he had a fair impression of the piece i would play it in entirety and he would listen intently in this way tom memorized many of the difficult works of beethoven liszt chopin men18 delssohn and other masters he was not a complete automaton he could ask a fairly intelligible question such as whether a note was a fourth or an eighth he knew the names of each pitch a b c etc and he had the gift of absolute pitch the instructor could not carry on a conversation with him however when he replied yes to a question she knew he did not understand when he really did understand he hissed and quivered nor was his playing completely mechanical he did more than mirror the playing of others his teacher revealed he could put expression and individuality into his performance he had a sturdy elastic technique and great accuracy toms custody which became an issue in the courts eventually passed to mrs albert t lerche the widow of a son of gen bethune in his last years he made his home in her hoboken apartment and toured in vaudeville at 59 he suffered a stroke which left one arm useless and the other impaired he stumbled to the piano tried to play and managed only a few discords tom cant play no mo  he muttered as he wept a few days later he was at the piano again singing softly then he sobbed ise all done missus and fell to the floor dead 
second class soldiers
by rabbi paul h levenson
now see here chaplain the deputy post commander scowled all this running around and poking your nose into things you have no business to is only going to get you into trouble he swung around in his chair and smiled wryly at me this was the third time id been invited into the generals office because of my activity on behalf of negro soldiers the colonel his deputy knew me well enough by now to smile why dont you publish all this in your memoirs when you get out of service he suggested for heavens sake dont print anything now his plea was an order and i had to accept it since i was only a chaplain 1st lt but i remembered his facetious suggestion and took it seriously i swore then and there to tell the story of how the negro soldier still suffers from the insanity of segregation in spite of the fact that the army proudly proclaims itself integrated its the story also of a handful of brave people who tried to right the wrongs committed against a sizeable number of our nations soldiers first the setting by far the largest number of permanent army bases are located in the south the liberal clergyman who lives down south by choice knows he must lock horns with strongly conservative elements who have psychological and often monetary investments in the maintenance of the segregated status quo he has to deal with them bargain cajole appeal to their consciences cry out 20 in the name of god all for the purpose of trying to allow a fellow human being to buy a tuna fish sandwich and a cup of coffee at a local drugstore the bigger issues of segregated schools housing and transportation will be decided by the courts meanwhile the liberal clergyman tries to create a climate of opinion favorable to the cause of civil_rights the liberal clergyman in the army who wants to back up his pulpit convictions with actions discovers that even in peacetime commanding generals object strongly to activists whom he thinks are rocking the militarycivilian goodwill boat within the limits of the southern army base everything is integrated on post housing is given to qualified soldiers on a firstcomefirstserve basis cafeterias post exchanges the racial composition of companies and battalions all are integrated even the town high schools are integrated because the government says they must or be turned down in their application for federal funds the army is integrated because it was ordered to do so about 10 years ago as a social experiment it can be termed an unqualified success despite individual experiences of overt or covert discrimination some men dont like it but they take it because they know there is no choice civilians who work on the particular southern army base at lege in florida while i paid for it by being in the army she graduated in june but cant get a job here in this town as a high school physics teacher thats what shes trained for actually she would take any teaching job at all the colored grammar school has enough teachers and the other ones in town would never hire her several of my friends wives taught in the town school system because many army wives teach there is an extraordinary turnover when their husbands are shipped out the schools need steady teachers so badly that a bonus of 30000 is given to any teacher who stays on one full year the negro soldier went on to explain that his wife could get no job at all in town not even as a department store counter girl which pays 500 an hour for an 8 hour day without the extra income it would be difficult to pay the high rents in the negro housing district rents there are 2000 more than comparable homes in the main part of town this mans case is typical and no exaggeration discrimination in offduty hours employment is quite trying on negro soldiers families since they use the money to supplement their skimpy cash income while the u s soldiers pay is quite good the actual cash received is not sufficient for building up a reserve the government calculates that medical benefits for families are worth a considerable amount and they take this into ac22 count when estimating total income another unseen benefit is retirement pay this is in effect deducted from the monthly pay and reduces the cash payments proportionately because of these reasons and the natural one of wanting more money to save or spend many soldiers work a few nights each week or wives might work during the day in this way they earn an extra 15002000 each year in addition to their army pay a sum equal to onethird their entire cash income per year the negro soldier and his wife though just as qualified as their white counterparts have no equality of opportunity in obtaining this outside work in southern towns this causes great hardship to many families but the army says it cant interfere with the policies of the local community and shrugs an apology the unfairness of this and other discriminatory practices particularly in the area of housing puts the liberal to the test i asked myself as a jewish rabbi could i practice in the south what i had preached so securely in long island new york less than 4 months before and with the added burden of being in the army and subject to its restrictions i felt that the least i should do is try to contact others and organize something to alleviate these conditions so unfavorable to the negro their wives and little children to live there some negro soldiers prefer not to have their families living in red light and high crime areas the results are nothing short of tragic ive met many such men their wives cant get jobs they dont want their children to shift from wellequipped and well staffed schools in unsegregated areas to the usually run down schools with the poorly trained teachers of the negro segregated school some of these negro soldiers decide to live alone in barracks far from their loved ones such separations have a demoralizing effect on the men and their families the assignment in the states for at least 18 months is supposed to be favorable duty when a soldier goes to korea he cant take his family along anyone with less than five years in the army cant possibly afford to transport his family and household goods to europe to add to these long forced separations another 18 months if a negro is assigned to a southern base and the situation becomes very tense some of these men go for years without spending more than a 30 day leave at home with their wives and children every now and then they cant take them overseas with them and they have enough respect for them that they wont permit them to live in red light districts when assigned to a southern post 24 we interviewers found disturbing problems confronting those who decided to stay in the negro section of the town close to the base there were 80 fairly decent units built with the help of a federal housing administration loan adjacent to this development which was rapidly deteriorating because of lack of adequate repairs was a closely spaced trailer camp of a similar number of units another area across the main highway into town was literally a shanty town of slapped together boards and tin cans even there some sections were restricted the development located on the hill was about a mile outside of town two miles from the main shopping area and three miles from the camp itself the houses and the trailer camps were planted with little thought given to the intended occupants comforts or conveniences not a single store of any type was opened on the hill since the development was too small to support it buses refuse to negotiate the hill to pick up people mothers without cars must take a taxi into town and back for a bottle of milk repairs were rarely made inadequate fire hydrants were noted there was insufficient street lighting in comparison with other parts of town and roads were not oiled down to keep them from being washed away though the grammar school on the army base is integrated the grammar school on the hill is de facto segregated the high schools in town are integrated the only ones that are in a radius of hundreds of miles the reason for these exceptions is the requirement that federal aid to schools which are used by dependents of large numbers of government employees can be given only if the local school district integrates its schools though the local school board is strongly segregationist they just couldnt afford to be in this case the negro grammar school on the hill though brand new is staffed only with negro teachers these teachers though dedicated dont receive the training and education in their southern negro teachers colleges that caucasians do in their caucasian teachers colleges its worth while noting that the few white soldiers families who live on one part of the hill send their young children to the grammar school in town by public school bus the net result is that government funds are being used to support segregated schooling i spoke to those segregated souls on the hill at a sunday church service i had arranged for their minister to talk to the jewish group during brotherhood week the sermon i gave was an impassioned plea to the minister and the congregation to organize themselves as the jews of america had done and fight discrimination with the strength of man they could appeal to the religious feelings of their fellow christians an avenue of approach that had borne results in other cities the sermon was received politely to their surprise i returned the love offering to their mission fund of the church and never heard a word from them thereafter plainly these people were unable to work for themselves they were sufficiently cowed that they would not raise a voice of protest even though they knew the truth of what i had said word of everything the committee members did was brought back to the commanding general by a spy an officer attached to division headquarters he gave us little sermons at our biweekly gettogethers about the dangers involved their illegality the fact that the general was aware of our existence and his strong disapproval the rest of us were resolved to continue though the danger of being expelled from the service for doing so became increasingly real the lone negro chaplain dropped out after the second meeting he had penned a hasty note to the commander of the wac garrison accusing her of keeping the wac barracks segregated this is what several girls had told him the commanding general was informed of the letter and had the chaplain on the carpet warning him to avoid all involvement with integrationist activity meanwhile i had invited the commanding general to my home he and his wife graciously attended despite his knowledge of my activities we spent much of the evening discussing the housing situation though the general finally cut it short with the unforgettable bellow i want you to remember sir the majority has rights too the final report was submitted to members of the committee who signed it included among them were 30 per cent of the forts 20 chaplains addressed to the commanding general it concluded the negro soldier although wishing to serve the army and his country to the best of his ability finds it difficult to do so under such adverse circumstances we hope that you will give this grave problem your prayerful consideration and we would respectfully suggest that the committee be formed to study this housing problem and if the above report is verified recommend to the city officials    that they discuss with the owners of rental property the advisability of integrated housing in their comunities» the report was never made officially when the general heard that it was about to be sent up to him he called the members of the committee into his office and warned them not to send it he had seen it unofficially and disapproved of it notices were printed in the daily bulletin reemphasizing a regulation prohibiting all unauthorized organizations which had to be approved by the command before they could be allowed to exist at the base our committee on housing ceased never to be revived officially or unofficially the episcopalian minister from town continued on in his work trying individual persuasion with town realtors but achieved very little i arranged material for him gathered from american jewish congress pamphlets on the myth of negroes destroying property values otherwise we had been silenced effectively the remedies for the illness of segregation in an army town must be stronger than a few foolhardy and idealistic soldiers and an occasional sermon by a chaplain about brotherhood publication of the facts such as these will help a sitin at a southern army base was reported by drew pearson in his syndicated column this past july this had them buzzing in the pentagon there are many high ranking officers who are decent people who want to see these insults to united states soldiers wiped out forever but they cannot act alone it will take public pressure lots of it to drive home to the men who have it within their power to change these conditions to do so as soon as possible have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother 
the day i discovered i was colored
by louie robinson
t he day of the great discovery had that special lemoncolored quality which seemed to me to come only to texas summers it was bright and fresh and offered boundless opportunities for baseball crawdading mumble peg stick horse or picking cars the latter was a game we played by lining up on the sidewalk taking turns from one through whatever number of us there were and any automobile that passed during your turn was yours in those days in my part of town the cars didnt come along too fast  i left home early that morning after a breakfast of oatmeal with cornflakes a compromise menu since my grandmother had insisted i needed something hot for all the energy i burned up and i wanted the com flakes because they were the same kind all those baseball football and golf stars ate the system seemed pretty simple to me eat the corn flakes and grow up to be a champion but then what did the name bob feller mean to my grandmother anyway i beat it out of there fast that morning before somebody started some jazz or other about me making up my bed or dusting the living room furniture boy i hated dusting i hightailed it up the alley to the mulberry tree on second street to meet the guys puddin head shultz was already there whittling on a stick when i ran up boy i bet that guy got up earlier than anybody in the whole world whenever we went hiking or fishing or something real early puddin head was the one who came around and woke everybody up his talents pretty much ended there whatcha doin i asked him for openers man im whittlin me a stick he answered whatcha makin i asked i aint makin nothin he said im whittlin me a stick it was a good conversation but i decided not to overdo it 28 i sat around silently watching puddin head for a few minutes until stinky higgins came along stinky was our cultural leader not only because at nine he was a couple of years older than most of the rest of us but he could also lick any kid in the block besides he was the only one in the bunch who knew how to cuss puddin head quit whittling his stick long enough to look up and yell hi stinky showing the kind of respect that a leader deserves hey stinky puddin heads whittlin him a stick i said figuring id bring him up to date on the mornings activities as quickly as possible hi puddin head stinky said with a grin then he looked at me and didnt say anything and his grin quit whats your problem i asked in surprise he was just standing there looking at me kind of funny and i figured maybe he wanted to fight or something it was okay with me but i couldnt see much point in fighting that early in the morning when there wasnt even anybody around yet but puddin head i couldnt whip stinky but at least the crowd always pulled for me in a fight because i was only seven and smaller than most of the other guys besides i won a lot of fights while i was standing there trying to decide whether i should just go on and sock stinky one first and then take my chances he said suddenly youre a damned spook aint cha a what puddin head asked looking up like i said in the world of semantics stinky was light years ahead of the rest of us he was still looking at me waiting for my answer i dont know i said you mean like a ghost or somethin naw i mean a spookspook stinky said look at cha youre black i looked at me im not black im brown i said black brown high yellowa spooks a spook stinky persisted who told you that puddin head wanted to know my old man stinky said he came home sober last night did your old man really come home sober puddin head asked yeah stinky said sitting down on the ground under the tree with us we thought he was sick or something anyway he told us all about colored people whats colored people i asked him youre colored people stinky said didnt your folks ever tell you not that i remember i said whats there to tell well stinky answered things like how you people can all sing and dance and stuff like that but youre not much good at readin and writin and figurin what the heck i said i negro digest december 1961 showed you how to read and write way last year my grandfather had taught me when i was four well we dont have any colored kids in our school cause theyre too dumb to keep up with us stinky scooped up a handful of mulberries off the ground and bit into them and the dark red juice squirted down the side of his mouth he wiped it away with his shirtsleeve besides he continued spooks aint very clean man my grandmother makes me bathe twice a week i protested we bathe at our house on saturday nights puddin head said every saturday night stinky asked most every saturday night puddin head said hygiene wasnt one of our favorite subjects so we soon got back to the heart of the conversation my old man says that hell if you go out of town on a damned bus or something stinky continued showing his mastery of profanity they make all the colored people ride in the back of it the hell you say i cut in i didnt know how to cuss and i had never ridden a bus but i figured that if when i did get on one i was going to have to ride in the back of it now was as good a time to start cussing as any where would i ride puddin head asked aint you listenin stinky demanded wed ride up front i was beginning not to like this at all so i decided to change the subject lets go swimmin i suggested my mother says shell whale the daylights out of me if she catches me goin swimmin again puddin head said lets race down to the fire plug it wont do any good stinky said matteroffactly whatcha mean it wont do any good puddin head said loudly you sure are talkin nutty today it just wont do any good for us to race down to the fire plug thats all stinky answered patientlv looies a spook aint he hell win they can all run faster than we can its somethin they got in their heels how come the last time we raced down to the fire plug i beat him a mile puddin head demanded are you callin my old man a damned liar stinky said hotly look maybe your old man just said all that because he was sober puddin head said he probably wont even remember it anymore besides if you dont like looie how come you live right across the street from him my old man says thats the difference in down south and livin up north down here we have houses together a lot but up north all the colored people live in one section of town what for puddin head asked 30 stinky ignored him but said to me and another thing stay away from my sister your sister i exploded boy i wish youd keep your dumb sister from over at my house playin with my fire engines and stuff leavin her dolls all over the place who wants to be bothered with your dumb sister boy that really burned me up his crummy sister was one big pain in the neck the only nice thing i could say about her was that she was still straight and hard like a boy and hadnt started getting all soft and lumpy like some of the older girls just thinking about girls made me so mad i had to crawl up in the mulberry tree to cool off while i was up there i decided i might as well do something useful so i picked all the berries i could stuff in my pockets without them bursting and staining my clothes and then i climbed back down the tree lets eat some berries i said pulling out a couple of hands full you gonna eat right here with us puddin head asked like he was suddenly getting the message where the hell you think im gonna eat in back of the tree i demanded i handed stinky his berries first in deference to his leadership then i handed some to puddin head and sat down on the ground with them and we ate tomorrow stinky said leaning back against the tree weve juot got to get segregated 
the bonus boy of boxing

s ince boxing became part of the olympic games in 1904 five boxers who gained olympic championships have won world championships as professionals frankie genaro fidel labarba and pascual perez among the flyweights jackie fields among the welterweights and floyd patterson present heavyweight champion the wee ones competed as flyweights in the international games while fields won the featherweight title and patterson the middleweight crown only one other olympic champion ever even gained a shot at a world championship that boxer of course was pete rademacher who won the heavyweight title in 1956 at melbourne and who in his first professional bout clashed with floyd patterson after having floyd on the floor pete was knocked out in the sixth round out of last years games in rome there are two young men who have made rapid strides since turning pro both are competing as heavyweights francisco depiccoli of italy who won the olympic heavyweight title has run off a string of nine straight wins seven of them by knockouts since he made his debut last december and cassius clay of louisville ky who gained the light heavyweight title in rome also has a clean slate cassius who made his pro debut in his home town last october has moved up faster than has depiccoli in clays most recent bout he scored a triumph over experienced alonzo johnson in his national tv debut it was also his eighth straight victory with five of these coming via the knockout route clay who is nineteen has boasted that he will win the heavyweight title before his twentyfirst birthday while that is a difficult goal his background gives him a good chance to achieve his goal as an amateur he won top honors in every tournament he entered and compiled a record of over 100 wins against a mere eight losses with most of those defeats coming during his first year of boxing it was an odd accident that caused him to turn to boxing when he was twelve years old he attended a basketball game at columbia hall in louisville and when he left the place he discovered that his bicycle had been stolen he asked where he could find a policeman and was told that there was one in the gym going downstairs he found joe martin the boxing director of the police boys club conducting a class he tearfully told joe of his stolen bike and what we would do to the guy who took it martin called in a report on the theft then asked clay if he knew 32 how to fight no said cassius brushing away a tear well you ought to come around here and learn so that you can take care of that guy if you find him advised martin learn how to protect yourself cassius did come back and it was martin who turned him into one of the top amateur boxers of recent years cassius last year won both the national aau and golden gloves championships he boxed as a light heavyweight in the aau tourney and a heavyweight in the golden gloves due to the fact that under aau rules the weight limit is a 178 pounds against 175 in the golden gloves a strapping six foot two inch lad with a rapier like left jab cassius scaled 186 pounds for his first bout in which he won a six round decision over veteran tunney hunnsacker clay scaled 192 pounds for his last fight with alonzo johnson following the victory over hunsacker clay scored five knockouts in a row stepping up in class with each victory he halted herb siler in four tony esperti in three jim robinson in one and donnie fleeman in seven fleeman had previously kayoed former heavyweight champion ezzard charles and beaten willi besmanoff in clays next fight he kayoed lamar clark in two rounds then he outpointed big duke sabedong in ten in las vegas sabedong an experienced ringman who stands six feet six scaled 226 against 194 pounds for clay and proved a tough nut for the youngster although clay was unable to knock his man out he won easily against johnson another crafty boxer cassius showed signs of his lack of experience but his natural ability was more than enough to make up the difference and he again won although it was a unanimous verdict clay did not show the ability to make good his boast of winning the title within two years while he was in florida he worked as a sparring partner with ingemar johansson when the swede was training for his match with floyd patterson and clay impressed ingo and the press with his quick hands and footwork hes good this fellow johansson said after a sparring session he did a lot of jumping around and isnt a bit like patterson as he changes around too much i hope i can get him for more sparring as he sharpens me up others who have been impressed by the abilities of clay include ray robinson archie moore and the ring editor nat fleischer who saw him in all his rome olympic bouts cassius is the great great grandson of a slave who borrowed the name of his owner cassius marcellus clay who was the u s ambassador to russia and a relative of the famed henry clay the fighters father is also named cassius clay  when he won the gold medal in rome clay was walking on a cloud i didnt take that medal off for two days said clay i even wore it to bed i didnt sleep too good because i had to sleep on my back so that the medal wouldnt cut me but i didnt care i was olympic champion he bought a bar and grill in louisville which was called the club havana but he changed the  name to the club olympic his father is operating the place for him when he decided to become a professional clay signed a contract with a group of business men who set up a corporation to manage him this corporation paid him 10 000 for signing and he will receive 4000 a year for the next two years then if the options are exercised 6000 a year for the following four years he will also receive fifty percent of his ring purses plus training and travelling expenses on the rapid advance he has made in the ten months he has been a pro it looks like these who signed him were real sharp business men and that the olympic medal may not be the only gold that cassius will possess aside from liston machen and johnson clay feels he is ready for any of the others if he sticks to his timetable of winning the championship before 1963 he will have to step out by next summer right now he has shown that he has the ability to handle the top grade men but how he would do against the ranking fighters is something which has to be answered true the present crop of heavyweights is far from the best but they are a crew with plenty of experience no matter how he fares young mr clay the noble roman has followed in the steps of baseballs bonus babies he looks like the rookie of the year

collect folk songs the oral history of t people folk songs are the articulated expression of the experience of people an index of the life and the spirit of the people who made them folk songs do not grow wild they are found under the most unusual circumstances take haiti for example in many respects the haitian and the american negro share the same cultural seed but of course haiti affords a more fertile soil for the cultivation of the african seed portauprince haitis capital is by no means a sleepy hollow remote entirely from noise and the bustle of the world its citizens while preserving a certain haitian simplicity in their manners and institutions have acquired a wide knowledge of other peoples from the tourist trade commercial and diplomatic relations then here too one will find the usual portable bootblacks cunning street venders and aspirant city slickers the streets are full of friendly people and their language culture and cuisine is french with african modifications i found haiti drenched in rum poetry music and art the rum is the best in the west indies the poetry is not bad the music is exciting and the art is primitive but we must leave all this city life for my unusual experience in haiti in the past several years haitian voodoo has acquired a notoriety which has prevented serious study of it most people have associated the term voodoo with zombies weird and sometimes orgiastic mysteries the tourist accepts the fake ceremonies staged for them and the haitian elite disclaims any knowledge of it but with the haitian peasant and the poor town folk it is a serious and sacred matter among the peasants survives a form of worship in which catholic and african cult practices are forged into one of the most discussed rituals in the western world my friend and guide marcel had learned that a special service was being held not too far from carrefour a town a little more than a half hours drive from the city of portauprince the ceremony was not to begin until late in the evening so i suggested to marcel that we stop by the casino before we drove to carrefour the casino is where many tourists go to try their luck at the wheel and many others go to view haiti through the bottom of a rum glass 36 i decided to take a taxi to the casino a hazardous ride it turned out to be the driver hurled into the midst of pedestrians and running children shouted and snarled insults in creole to all those who barred his path i held on to my seat for dear life after a few minutes of this i was virtually thrown out in front of the casino drenched with perspiration and fright weakly i went into my pockets to pay the daredevil there i was kept busy several minutes more while i searched through a roll of filthy wrinkled haitian banknotes and tormenting little coins before i drew out one gourde to pay the driver a gourde is about twenty cents in american money une table pour deux i addressed the waiter near our table i observed two american girls prowling like jaguars very soon they caught the attention of a haitian playboy and immediately they began pecking out high school french in huntandpeck fashion i later noticed a very dignified haitian gentleman weaving around the tables and singing pour le drapeau la patrie i recognized the tune as the first bars of the national anthem of haiti as he ended on maurir est beau he stood towering above my table and without the slightest provocation he addressed me pardon monsieur what will america do when castro takes over her base in cuba his real intent was of a subtle nature there was a moment of silence from all the tables nearby i merely stared at him my american ego was ruffled and i didnt know exactly the best thing to say at the critical moment it was marcel who came to my rescue he suggested we had better be going now you dont have much time for talk dear old marcel after we reached carrefour we still had about three miles to walk we had to climb a rough winding mountain path there were no available roads leading to the site of the service very soon the only neon sign on the main road in carrefour blinking hesitantly was left far behind we had only the moon and the stars to guide us we walked about a mile before i heard the faint beat of a drum in the far distance after stumbling over the rocky path that led up the mountainside a climb that seemed to have lasted for hours we finally came to the top of the mountain the drums were quite near now when we reached the hurriedly erected hut the service was already in progress a voodoo ceremony permits expression of the haitians most original art formssinging dancing and drumming traditional songs dances and drum beats are associated with the different types of worship service the ceremony itself has a definite form there is little opportunity for variation or testimony as practiced in many of the american rebel and splinter churches many of the ceremonies held in portauprince and its environs are faked for the tourists but a haitian drummer cannot fake he must play the threeman percussion battery this night were playing for a mange loa rite the feasting of the gods it is necessary to replenish occasionally the source of energy of the gods which is constantly drawn from them by their  worshippers the most common offerings are chickens pigeons ducks goats and pigs a woman garbed in white wearing a tightly bound white cotton cloth around her head raised a banana leaf toward the sky she then oriented it that is she pointed it in the four cardinal directions as she turned to each point she chanted dieu le pere dieu le fils dieu le saint esprit et les myssteries in the name of the god the father of my spirits and my gods as she stood there erect and tense i was deeply moved by the sincerity of her poignant invocation the drummers had churned up a beady sweat and already their bodies were drenched in perspiration as i watched the strange cabalistic figures being drawn upon the ground instinctively and passionately my body began to sway i sat there swaying and trying hard to recall some strange familiar beat once lost in the recesses of my body i caught hold of myself for the moment and looked around for marcel i discovered him on the far side of the hut dancing in the circle of worshippers in a voodoo ceremony the bodies of the dancers never touch marcel caught my sharp gaze and i believe he gave me a rather encouraging nod to join in the service the drums were becoming louder now my head became dizzy and my body was hot again i thought once that i might faint au nom du pere et du fils et du saint esprit gan yin bon dieu in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost there is a god the chorus of women were singing now in the midst of this invocation a hellish shriek went up from a man rolling on the ground he had become possessed possession is a most important phenomenon in voodoo the behavior of the people when they are possessed has a theatrical quality when a god enters the head or mounts a person the others are entertained by his spiritual catalepsis the whole personality of a mounted person is changed during the state of possession he is then in a state to converse with the gods and even with deceased persons one cannot listen very long to haitian drums without being moved in some manner by their infectious rhythm i began to wonder if it were possible for me to become possessed i began swaying again 38 and i joined in the hand clapping the thin veneer of civilization was cracking it seemed as the insistent drums radioed their message my feet voluntarily began moving haiti was absorbing me possessed now i could feel the beat of the drums synchronizing with my heart beat and flowing in my blood africa was calling from the marrow of my bones and i was answering the prodigal son had returned the drums were urging the body to dance some strange suppressed metaphysical powers were demanding satisfaction the tempo of the drums increased the voodoo priest began to dance slowly at first the drums and the singing went on and on getting faster and wilder dominating the hearts and the feet of all the circle most of the worshippers were now trembling and shivering some had dropped to the ground and lay there as in a trance everyone seemed possessed by the frenzy of the drums the spirits of their ancestors were surely abroad tonight in complete surrender i found myself upon the floor my feet were following some strange step i suddenly became conscious that the drums had changed their beats and most of the dancers had left the circle and then a glassyeyed mambo a high priestess in voodoo hierarchy bounced into the room her body began to move like an angry snake and at otner times like an olympic star her hips undulated and rotated in accelerated rhythms and the violent jerks of her head threatened to dislocate her cervical vertebrae her serpentine movements sent writhing waves from her head to her feet then pandemonium broke out everyone was singing and jumping about wildly the whole hut was sent suddenly a most terrifying shriek shocked me back to my senses it was then that i noticed that marcel was standing by my side grinning and sweating profusely when my heartbeat had sufficiently slowed to render speech audible i turned to him lets get out of here i urged him i had just witnessed the first part of a most unusual ceremony also my first and last lesson in the catechism of island voodoo i had been baptised in its nocturnal rhythm as we dragged down the road into carrefour already the solid walls of the tropical heat was holding the early morning in her molten arms i raised my eyes and looked back over the hills bursting from their primitive shells the source of haitian comfort nowhere do men live closer to hills that sustain and embrace them please hurry and get a taxi i pleaded to marcel my feet are sore marcel looked at me proudly and repeated an old creole proverb apre das tabou toujou lou when the dance is over the drum is always heavy as i settled back in the taxi en route back to the city i thought i heard the faint beat of a drum and possibly i did drums will always play in haiti today as yesterday tomorrow and always

negro at the lowest  level of income and  education feels cut off  niy from socy but from many within his own race he is the true outsider in washington he believes that those in his race who hold good jobs and live in decent homes have turned their backs on him he and thousands like him comprise what is for want of a better termthe lower class of negroes that the negro has distinct classes with all of the accompanying friction and antagonism that the word implies should come as no surprise there are class structures in all groups within the negro population however the classes are particularly complicated there is a group within our racethey call themselves the educated group or the upper crust and they feel they are better than the rest of us a government worker said they actually build barriers within our own race what are these barriers one of the most important is also the most subtle it has to do with the word negro itself and what that word means youll meet many people in washington who will not use the word negro a distinguished negro educator said its a bad word so many painful memories are associated with it they might say colored but they might not even say that they almost try to deny such a race exists those scars are part of the experience of the negro some negroes will argue there are middle and upper class groups that are divorced from the problems of their race these people live in good homes insulated by  their own small social groups they are not fighting for their race they are afraid of anything which might upset their status you see a young negro minister said when you reach the plateau of the middle class you dont want to rock the boat you dont want to disturb the situation especially once youre looked on as a socially desirable class until the middle and the upper classes realize that what happens to the lower classes affects them too no matter how much money or status they have you arent really going to be able to solve the problem from within theyre out of contact with the other groups he said they dont have to come home to one room and not know where the next meal is coming from they dont really feel these things and so they dont understand is this true negroes who have studied the problem say it is this reporter can only say he has been in some homes where it appears to be true in fairness though this has not been a common experience the negro intellectual is especially concerned about this problem he will say that often negroes who have risen to fivefigure incomesand there are many in this category in washingtonseem to wish to disassociate from the race they even will look down on negro folk music and literature a negro scholar says this reflects an attitude of second generation respectability i think its a weakness he said it tends to break down the connection between the educated and the lower groups bessie smith mahalia jackson people like that are honored in the community for their way of singing the people understand it its a part of their culture why should it be denied theres too much hypersensitivity about too many things a businessman said we are confronted with an entirely new type of opposition from a group which mistakenly identifies itself as the new negro  he defined this kind of person as the selfefficient arrogant smug and underexposed individual who feels he has arrived his basic shortcoming lies in his desire to disassociate and his failure to share his knowledge with people of his own race who he feels are not up to standards that he now knows a negro sociologist tells about talking to a woman in this economic and social group who had watched louis armstrong on television the night before  wasnt that terrible she said i said no why she said oh you know he doesnt look right she meant he was too black then i said i think hes an artist and we should be proud of him she still thought they should have got someone else at howard university one student has several charcoal sketches 42 of negroes on his dormitory wall they portray negro men and women with prominent negroid features you see those the student said pointing to the wall you know what many of the boys say when they see them they say oh those are terrible they mean theyre too negroid i keep them there as my private form of psychoanalysis for the others these attitudes still are factors in the colored classes in washington although their importance has diminished greatly in recent years thats what a colored man meant when he said the negroes in washington had to do their own integrating after 1954 at one time the shade of a mans skin played a significant role among the negro population in the capital this was a heritage from slavery days when the lightskinned negro was given advantages over the man with a darker skin i think today there is a little less emphasis on color among negroes a businessman who was born and educated in washington said but its hard to change the habit of years of tradition back in the old days the negro developed what im sure you heard of as a bastard aristocracy my own father was a mulatto for instance and lived in a certain class color became almost a caste both economically and socially to be a mulatto almost always identified you with a powerful white family those children had more opportunities they were sent away to school and formed their own societies in the northern cities usually they intermarried with each other to maintain the masquerade some of them were able to pass for whites it meant of course they had more advantages this is not so true today but it is true that many of the really old washington families actually resented integration to put it personally my mother was one of those shes rather stiffnecked about it who are these people in the better classes they are the same as in any group status is determined by money and education at the top are the professional groups the doctors lawyers teachers businessmen and highranking government employes in the middle is a large group of government workers merchants and ministers in many of these families the wife works and the husband has a second job so they can buy a home in a decent section at the bottom are the unskilled laborers i think your slum dwellers today are very sharply divided from your bourgeoisie a scholar said your professional groups have cliques there is your clash todaybetween the laborers and recent migrants from the south and the washington middle class expressing it another way its the old story that the lower classes are jealous and well they might be negroes will tell you with justifiable pride that this city has a better standard of living from the negro point of view than any other city in the united statesor in the world for that matter in the higher brackets the negro in washington may earn up to  100000 a year a negro businessman said for those who have been able to take advantage of the opportunities here the material rewards are visible the most striking is the neighborhood where the wealthiest negroes live in the far northwest off sixteenth street near the carter barron amphitheater and rock creek park this section is enviously called the gold coast certain sections seem to denote certain standards a colored man said for instance i live in brookbnd in northeast washington off rhode island avenue and they will say oh you live with the rich negro its the same way with the gold coast where the richest negroes live when the phrase gold coast was mentioned to a man who lives there he smiled and said yes i know that the other negroes call this the gold coast there are some who call this the negros spring valley well since this is the best area thats the reason we guard it just as jealously as they do in spring valley or wesley heights were not snobbish thats not it but look at it this way why put a big price on a home if youre going to allow the neighborhood to deteriorate no no one up here is snobbish although i guess there are negroes in other parts of town who think so a housewife on that street told how worried everyone was because a family who left southwest because of the redevelopment moved in next to the church on the corner and we are all quite upset about the appearance of the yard the man sits out on the porch in his overalls they are a more rural type of family not the way other people here are as you go down the economic ladder you will hear similar comments here are some certainly theres a difference among negroes its not snobbery but lets face it if a person isnt of the same background as you you dont even get anything out of a conversation with him you wouldnt choose that kind of person as a friend or marry that type ive sat down next to some of my people on the streetcar and frankly i dont relish it i guess we just consider ourselves better than others when you come down to that part of it im segregated myself there are some of em i wouldnt be caught walking the street with now i got to say itthere are some who just dont fit in with the people in washington youll find this in all races some they dont fix up like us we was both glad when the people next door moved they wasnt good neighbors were not all in the same class as one man said everyone knows there are second class negroes

a series of suc2  cessful song recital appearances in holland last summer i accepted an invitation to spend two weeks at the villa of friends on the french riviera the evening of my return to paris i was confronted by a friend with a copy of a leading french newspaper le journal du dimanche and he called to my attention a large article regarding a search for a young negro frenchspeaking actor for a leading role in a new  play by the popular french playwright marcel ayme the play supposedly dealt with racial problems in the united states the play was slated to open in exactly three weeks and the article gave every indication that the producers were desperately anxious for anyone with the abovementioned qualifications to apply for an audition my friend who is a french businessman and knows very little about show business assumed that since i had enjoyed some measure of success as a serious singer i should be able to act too after he had paid me that obviously kind compliment i gave out with a hearty chuckle and replied while ive had some dramatic training i do not profess to be an actor my dramatic studies were pursued only to enhance my stage presence and perhaps familiarize me with the stage in case of any operatic opportunities he continued to insist that i should audition for the part and as a means of terminating the subject as quickly as possible i jokingly agreed to do the audition if he would make all the necessary arrangements thinking he had received the message that i couldnt have been more disinterested i promptly began to tell him about the glorious vacation i had spent on the breathtakingly beautiful riviera i was so very wrong because he actually took me seriously and arranged for an audition after which he sent me an express note saying he had taken heed of my advice and had made all the arrangements i was positively flabbergasted to put it mildly realizing his genuine sincerity i knew i could not and would not fail to appear for that audition accompanied by him and another friend who was vacationing in paris from his native denmark i appeared at the theatre de la renaissance one of the most beautiful theatres in europe at the appointed hour 46 we were greeted by the producer the director and the author himself and to my great surprise they reacted as though they had found a longlost friend i thought that extremely odd since id never before seen either of them they immediately began to look at me from head to foot and silently but very busily nodding their approval ive had many auditions but never have i been exposed to such flattery then came the question have you had any acting experience i replied that i had had little or no acting experience on the legitimate stage but i had studied drama at the new england conservatory in boston while pursuing my vocal and repertory studies there their glowing faces changed slightly and the producer said quite apologetically you do understand that the role demands an actor who also has command of the french language i replied equally embarrassed yes i do and was all prepared to offer my apologies and excuse myself at that precise moment the producer perked up a bit and said but would you read for us anyway i frankly couldnt see the logic in it but i agreed a gesture was made for me to walk through a door onto the stage and i asked for a few minutes to review and study the scene they had suggested i read for them it later turned out to be the most difficult of all a few minutes later i appeared on stage my two buddies standing proudly in the wings and began to read the scene with a very charming young lady who later turned out to be magali noel a popular film actress in france germany and italy i later apologized for not having recognized her nor her famous name i remember having so much enjoyed her work in rififi another equally talented actress marpessa dawn dashed over to give me a mostassuring handshake and a warm smile no one could ever forget her in black orpheus my reading of the part went miserably enough and again i was quite prepared for the legendary thankyou  dontcallus  well callyou bit again i was so wrong and how wrong i was they not only offered me the part but asked me to sign the contract right then and there i conceded that this was just too good to be true hence i asked for a 24 hour thinkitover period quite reluctantly they agreed i returned to the theatre the next day at the exact hour and gave them my decisionyes everyone concerned seemed happy and excited including me who couldnt have been more disinterested at the outset of this whole experience the happiness and excitement unknowingly was to be reversed later i commenced intensive study of the text and discovered that the role of david a southern american negro graduate law student was indeed an interesting one from many points of view the first being i was tremendously impressed that someone had had the courage to write a part of great dignity and intelligence for a negro actor especially in a play dealing with racial problems in the u s i felt that i was obliged to become an actor in three short weeks in order to play such a choice rolethinking that if i did a reasonably acceptable job it would perhaps inspire other writers to follow the trend of marcel ayme after eleven days of really gruelling study of the text and character i emerged having learned and memorized some 250 lines that would stagger the most seasoned actorto say nothing of learning it in the french language marcel aymes style is considered to be fiendishly difficult even for the french i felt proud to have worked so well and felt at this point i was ready to begin staging the part with the director andre villiers that is where the trouble started monsieur villiers gave me a brief rundown on the stage business in my big scenes with mile noel i had a general idea of what he wanted so i did not press him for minute details as i was sure he would bring all those to my attention as the rehearsals progressed i was happier than i can remember because i suppose of the tremendous challenge it proposed it was during the more detailed points of interpretation that monsieur villiers and i began to see things quite differently he insisted that i portray the role of david in a stereotype uncle tom manner and of course i was not only shocked but thoroughly embarrassed at first i thought i had not understood him correctly i had my fellow players showed equal shock and embarrassment that he should distort the original conception of the part thereby robbing it of the personal dignity pride and intelligence of anyone who possessed a masters degree in law as had david i knew full well i had not misunderstood the text nor the original intentions of the author and i stood my ground but firmly i tried to reason with him and even told him that no negro student in america today would act like thaton the contrary i went so far as to ask if he read the newspapers if he had he would know that it is the students that have brought about equality for negroes in america he wouldnt hear me out and stubbornly stood by his guns after innumerable disputes i finally walked out of rehearsal just four days before opening night immediately i went to every newspaper in paris including the associated press and told my story the next morning it certainly was the scandale de paris the first newspaper i went to i was promptly given the runaround and was told by three different people that there was no one there to talk to me i accepted this untruth 43 and made my way to the ap office in paris and was interviewed by a very kind gentleman named mcnulty who hails from california only after the ap called to verify my abdication of the role did the other papers give me an interview many people mostly french have said to me that it must have taken great courage for me to give up my first starring role in what appeared at first to be an important play i personally do not consider it courage at all but rather my way of aiding the cause of black peoples everywhere many of whom have given their lives and my contribution is nothing by comparison the play was finally reviewed on sept 21st after an african young man replaced me and they agreed with me to the man that it was the most oldfashioned boring and insulting play to be presented to the french public about life in the southern united states the critics even went on to reprimand the author for having the audacity to set himself up as an authority on a subject about which he knows so little alongside tennessee williams and william faulkner the critics recalled that its the second time that marcel ayme has attacked the u s in that he wrote la mouche bleue the blue fly a few seasons back which only lasted three days i feel very sure that his last similar effort louisiane will meet the same fate

in the soul of the south as it is now they tend to concede only that professional southerners are preoccupied with the wrongs and sufferings they endured at the hands of the reconstructionists a

which they now superiorly disassociate themselves instead of meeting headon what stares them in the face the critics regret the inclination of the supremely talented southern writers faulkner capote

wendolyn brooks has a quiet face when she smiles her eyes seem to be laughing at something which only she understands it is as though she were amused by some aspect of a joke which we have missed as though she were including the whole world in the joke it is difficult to see gwendolyn brooks the pulitzer prize winning poet when you are looking at gwendolyn brooks the woman she is cryptic in her lack of pretension baffling in her perfect role as just a chicago housewife not long ago a newspaper man from sweden called her up explaining that he was an ardent admirer of her poetry and that he would like very much to interview her before he left the city three other men were there when he arrived all of them novelists the men began talking about the philosophical trends in contemporary literature about race relations thruout the world and similarly weighty topics gwendolyn brooks spent the entire evening serving coffee tea and cookies and emptying ash trays it was nearly morning when the newsman realized that he hadnt heard a squeak out of gwendolyn at his request she read one of her poems then exhausted by the long evening he tottered back to his hotel still wondering what gwendolyn brooks is really like only the shelves of books in her tiny gray walled living room give her away only her work exposes her as the consummate artist she is her poems and stories are about people she can make a poem about a 47th street hepcat ring so true that cold shivers run up your spine she can write of an abor54 tion or a childs coming home from school in a way that is almost ethereal yet as stunning as a quick left jab her style reminds you of virginia woolf at her best but when you think of the complexity of ideas in her work you must think of william faulkner and when you consider her force and photographic clarity you must recall thomas wolfe because she generates so much electricity in her writing it is all the more ironic that on that may night in 1950 when a newspaper reporter telephoned her and asked do you know youve won the pulitzer prize gwendolyn brooks was literally in the dark the power company had cut off her lights until she could scrape together enough money to pay her bill she received the news with a scream then she took her little boy to the movies even on the threshold of fame she could not act the part of the laureled poetess in annie allen the book which had earned her the prize she mused and if the sun comes how shall we greet him shall we not dread him after so lengthy a session in the shade her years in the shade were not always happy but they were productive for gwendolyn has been writing as long as she can remember as early as age 7 she was embroiled in a literary dispute her school teacher finding her handwriting hard to take it is still hieroglyphic today gave her an f on a composition gwendolyns mother angered by the womans obvious lack of perception informed the teacher that gwendolyn was probably a better writer than the teacher and read the composition on the spot the teacher agreed and changed the grade later critics have not needed to be intimidatedtheir praise has been continuous and loud paul engle of the university of iowa calls her work the best poetry that is being written in chicago these days rolfe humphries reviewing her poems in the nation said her strength consists of boldness invention a daring to experiment a naturalness that does not scorn literature but absorbs it exploits it    the famous negro poet claude mckay wrote a poem to her and richard wright the late pioneering novelist proclaimed her technique and fire when gwendolyn was 13 her technique may have been shaky but the fire was already smoldering she was editor publisher and circulation manager of the champlain weekly probably the only newspaper in history which was handwritten and delivered by its publisher and she had a marvelous source of newsher mother as the ladies in the neighborhood poured out their souls to mrs brooks she in turn poured their stories into gwendolyns eager ears and gwendolyn poured them into the pages of her little newspaper two things combined to sabotage gwendolyns early publishing career the collective fury of outraged housewives and competition from the chicago tribune which was selling for 2 cents a copy while production costs forced her to sell her news for a nickel in 1936 gwendolyn then 19 received a two year certificate from wilson junior college that ended her school days she wanted a degree but hard times dictated a paying job and she found herself working in an unusual office opening letters laying aside the coins and bills that fell out of them and answering them the answers were brief my dear mrs jones i am sure your husband still loves you you must have faith and continue using the love potion thank you for your order the office was a kind of church gwendolyn remembers and it was in the mecca building that used to be at 33d and state the rev the man who ran the office received tons of mail from people who wanted holy thunderbolts love charms and magic potions we made the charms and brewed the potions ourselves i got 8 a week and i hated it when the reverend offered to make me assistant pastor i quit the experience was not wasted though she is completing a new novel based on her recollections of the mecca building at 22 gwendolyn met her man henry blakely wrote poetry and the attraction was mutual and instantaneous they were married a month later reading books all night writing together in silence in the same room reading their work to each other going to writers workshopsit was gwendolyns dream turned real but real too was their need for money too real were the dreary one room kitchenette apartments they lived in over the stores near the l track it was in these days and these places that gwendolyn wrote one of the best known poems of her first collection a street in bronzeville it was entitled simply kitchenette building we are things or gray hours and the involuntary plan grayed in and gray dream makes a giddy sound not strong like rent feeding a wife  satisfying a man but could a dream send up thru onion fumes its white and violet fight with fried potatoes and yesterdays garbage ripening 56 in the hall flutter or sing an aria down these rooms     gwendolyn brooks was living the life she wrote about the tears in her poems were her own as her words slipped into print the honors came and the prizes twice she was winner of the poetry workshop award twice she received the guggenheim fellowship for creative writing the american academy of arts and letters and the national institute of arts and letters both gave her grants and in 1945 mademoiselle magazine named her one of americas 10 women of the year in 1949 she returned these favors by producing her masterpiece of collected poems annie allen today gwendolyn and her husband an as yet unpublished novelist who earns the familys livelihood as an insurance adjuster live with their 10 year old daughter nora in a small one story frame house on chicagos south side their son henry jr is in the marines she is just a little more subdued than in earlier days altho she no longer belongs to a civil_rights organization she met her husband at an naacp youth council meeting in her latest book of poetry the bean eaters she utters one of the most piercing outcries against the murder of chicagoan emmett till that has ever appeared in print she is familiar now with the hollow land of fame but she has never lost sight of the rainbow love is the rainbow she chases love in the broadest sense love of each man and woman by each man and woman she wants to show her readers the golden cord of humanity that unites every girl in a tattered dress and every girl in a gown of silk she declares it in her precise but passionate poetry and in the jazzlike experiments of her one short novel maude martha she is saying that birth happiness sorrow and toil are much more extraordinary than they usually seem to us she is saying that lifes real magic lies in these things alone and that we are still strangers to the reality which we have abandoned in our search for some vague higher truth in her childrens book bronzeville boys and girls she puts the essential question of our existence so gently do you ever look in the looking glass and see a stranger there a child you know and do not know wearing what you wear there is a poet in this town her neighbors know her as mrs henry blakely housewife and mother who keeps a tidy home does her own cooking and gets her daughter off to school on time her readers know her as gwendolyn brooks imager of chicagos lights and dark places a voice of soft power dedicated to people all people striding to the market with her shopping bag or scrawling on endless sheets of scratch paper in the hush of night she is the reality of her poemssomeone you know and do not know wearing what you wear  

the positi general busin selling point c this mean gro middle comes entwir dilemma or find that social and ecc on the other 1 terest in the i gives them tunity for since they eluded from a prominent executive admonishes negro businessmen to abandon the concept of negro business and to adopt the idea of negrocontrolled business by operating in the community at large and meeting the standards prices and service of the competition n of the negro in ess is based on the f racial solidarity  that the entire nend upper class beed in an idealogical the one hand they egation blocks their nomic opportunities tand they have an injegro market since it rtain limited opporgroowned business e almost always exthe white market it becomes a matter of vast importance to properly cultivate the negro market with few exceptions therefore negroowned business is dependent upon the negro market historically the negro operated in the field of general business before the emancipation proclamation a negro slave lunsford lane of raleigh north carolina purchased his freedom from the sale of a superior smoking tobacco which he and his father manufactured thorny lafon a free negro in new orleans operated a drygoods store from which he branched out into the moneylending business to accumulate an estate of 413000 at his death in 1893 stephen smith and william whipper were successful lumber and oyster merchants in philadelphia they owned and operated one of the largest coal yards in the city of brotherly love it was reported in 1849 that the firm held 250000 feet of lumber 22 merchantmen cars running between baltimore and philadelphia and 9000 worth of stock in the columbia bridge their notes were accepted anywhere for any amount smith donated 150000 in 1864 for the establishment of a home for aged and infirmed colored people other examples of successful negro businessmen in the 18th and 19th centuries can be found in many books and papers dealing with this subject caterers carriage makers newspaper publishers shopkeepers and other negro businessmen were operating in boston washington charleston philadelphia and savannah during this period during and after world war i the continuous fluid migration of negroes to centralcity areas from rural areas created a new demand for services never before witnessed in the nation barber shops beauty parlors restaurants funeral parlors candy stores bootblack parlors small grocery stores and novelty shops spring up like mushrooms in new york atlanta detroit chicago st louis cleveland washington philadelphia and other cities whose negro populations were growing by leaps and bounds 60 to say the least the success of many of these businesses was shortlived negroowned businesses are usually hampered by lack of capital credit restrictions lack of trained personnel and by a lack of sound methods of simple business principles these are the surefire catalytic agents which foredoom them to failure gunnar myrdal reports in an american dilemma in 1939 there were not quite 30000 negroowned retail stores including eating and drinking places giving employment to an almost equal number of proprietors and less than 14000 hired employees orapart from 1000 unpaid family members a total of 43000 persons thus negro retail trade in terms of employment is not totally insignificant compared with the size of white retail trade however it is negligible the total sales in 1939 were 71000000 which was less than twotenths of one per cent of the national total myrdal further states there were no signs of improvement in the relative position of negro retail trade the proportion of negroes among all retail dealers was if anything smaller in 1930 than in 1910 the same trend downward is visible during the period of 19291939 a more recent report shows that the major negroowned financial institutions which include 51 life insurance companies 21 savings and loan companies and 11 banks have total assets of a little over a halfbillion dollars when compared with the 478 billion dollar assets of whiteowned financial institutions in the same category the assets of 83 negroowned top financial institutions pale into almost total insignificance i briefly cite this current report to show that myrdals findings in 1939 prove that practically all negroowned businesses are retrogressing year by year when measured with comparable whiteowned businesses all is not on the red side of the ledger however great strides have been made by astute and resourceful negro businessmen and negroowned business institutions the story of h b fuller and his integrated cosmetic empire fulfills the american dream of a land of opportunity his story has graced the pages of fortune and ebony magazines as well as the financial pages of our great newspapers other than his insurance interests a g gaston who is noted for his genius in business diversification operates successful enterprises including an uptodate motel a wellequipped business college a bank the a g gaston homes a number of undertaking establishments throughout alabama a walgreenfranchised drugstore and several other business ventures successful radio stations are owned and operated by haley bell in detroit j b blayton sr in atlanta and edward pate in kansas city the sun village water improvement company a 500000 public utility serving an interracial community of 600 in the arid antelope valley near los angeles is headed by negro realtor melvin r grubb in the field of electronics louis g alexander and his associates in chicago head practical electronics manufacturing company the first negroowned business to win a prime u s contract which ran into the millions of dollars then there is detroits house of vending a highly successful vendingmachine company run by two hardworking partners leroy b pope and taylor cooper operating in the michigan cities of detroit flint and pontiac they maintain over 600 cigarette machines and 200 coffee candy gum hot food and softdrink machines they have consistently grossed over a million dollars during their four years in business in the field of transportation the safe bus company of winstonsalem north carolina operates and maintains 55 uptodate buses hauling negro and white passengers unsegregated while most of its fifty stockholders and all its board members find employment and security in the company the safe lines greatest pride is not in its financial success so much as its contribution to social progress to its officials and seventyyearold president john adams the negroowned company has stood as a beacon for racial cooperation for more than three decades last year in gary indiana 28 year old willie e boyd jr purchased the yellow cab franchise for 35000 with an integrated staff he operates 24 radioequipped taxis which grossed 75000 in the first six months also in gary andrew means heads his own building and construction firm so successful was the construction of means park manor a 149home 4000000 development ranging from  15000 to 75000 per unit that he has become the leading builder of homes government buildings and industrial construction in the steel city james woods of los angeles heads his own building and construction firm which specializes in complete housing developments including shopping centers and churches the story of the great california architect paul williams is a legend many of hollywoods famed movie stars homes as well as nationally known department stores and other types of buildings from coast to coast were designed by this gifted man great strides have been made in the meatpacking and sausage business by henry parks headquartered in baltimore and selling on the east coast in major supermarket chains judge parker sells his famous parker house sausages and provi62 sion meats in illinois michigan and indiana in cleveland leroy crayton producer of craytons sausages and meats operates in ohio and surrounding states george sevelle owner of sevelle enterprises in los angeles maintains all of union oil and richfield oil service stations in eleven western states he developed a special paint for service station driveways which prevents waste oil grease and gasoline from penetrating the concrete negro businessmen have also achieved success in africa tom brown of new york city an expert in refrigeration and air conditioning heads the firm camafrica in accra ghana his company manufactures coolers for coca cola and pepsi cola and oil cans and service station equipment for texaco mobile oil and shell oil his crew of thirty ghanaian sheetmetal workers welders electricians and mechanics service the refrigerators and airconditioning units of one of the largest department stores in ghana speaking of africa our federal government is making tremendous strides in cooperating with the new independent african nations in trade and industrial development as negro businessmen with a vested interest in america we should make every possible financial effort to profitably aid in the development of these nations after all who can be a better salesman of democracy in africa than a negro businessman with some worthwhile product or service to contribute i do not intend to imply that negro businessmen should become missionaries in africa they should seek to establish bona fide business relations and in so doing will bring to the african nations those products and services which they sorely need many other successful cases of enterprising negro businessmen can be cited all over the world the examples pointed out prove that negroowned business can succeed in practically every type of industry in the total economy the disturbing problem of negroowned business however is its inability to keep pace with other business enterprises in the total economy as previously stated when negroowned businesses are matched with the same types of whiteowned businesses they pale by comparison into almost total insignificance following are major steps which must be taken by negroowned business to assure growth expansion competence and even survival in our everchanging economy 1 develop a sound research program which is so necessary in planning for the present as well as for the future 2 relegate the function of marketing which includes advertising sales sales promotion and public relations to the policymaking level 3 prepare sales campaigns with imagination and enthusiasm and with welldefined incentives for salesmen 4 develop topflight continuous training programs for all personnel 5 develop an image of goodwill and respect for your business by planning an effective public relations program 6 seek out and develop new investment possibilities in reference to financial institutions such opportunities as housing developments savings and loan associations the granting of loans to competent young negroes with sound ideas and other imaginative investment potentials are available 7 seek new profits by mergers acquisitions and diversification into mutually profitable related businesses 8 avoid the employment of relatives and close friends when their lack of competence acts as a detriment to the effective operation of the business 9 create new ways of adding to the longrange value of products by offering new services and developing new attitudes toward the increasingly sophisticated consumer 10 eliminate the concept of negro business and operate in the sphere of negrocontrolled business serving the community with competence by meeting competitive prices and standards

d brandeis editor of the holyoke weekly courier drove north it was good to be getting away for a couple of weeks holyoke had never had a lynching before and in mississippi that was a pretty good record he looked to his right to the broad slow sprawl of water the greenclad bluffs with naked rock showing through southerners were like the river placid on top and slowly seething underneath up here in minnesota folks werent like that in the deepening dusk the tires whined hypnotically the lynching had been inevitable of course wilson should have left the white woman alone during the sheriffs token trial for complicity eds editorials had scored the northern meddlers deeply on that point wilson had deserved lynching he had argued besides what could the sheriff have done the power of a mob is awesome state militia a man doesnt call in armed strangers against his friends and neighbors the sheriff had been acquitted and the couriers circulation had soared ed had been on the side of the right still it somehow bothered him he was glad to just get alone and think a couple of miles beyond one of the sleepy river hamlets that dot the mississippi ed stopped for a hitchhiker he was a short heavyset youth with closecropped black hair and tight levis and an orange windbreaker thanks for the lift mister he grinned crawling in beside ed im just going to the next town tonight thatll be swell the boy yawned and stretched spreading his arms wide across the back of the seat he had a broad neck and his dark eyes were hypnotically intense in a conversational tone he said theres a dirt road up here to the right use it what use it pops the boy shouted ramming something hard and cold and round against the back of eds neck or ill spread your brains all over the windshield i really will ed wrenched the heavy battered buick into the side road he recognized incipient hysteria in the voice pull in on the other side of that big oak and stop ed slowed the car swung obediently in behind the spreading hardwood tree the lights glared back from waxy foliage okay pops open your door slow keep both hands in sight knew a fellow once kept an automatic strapped between the seat and the door on the drivers side thats fine now step free of the door    good just like an old pro ed thought grimly when this is over sonny getting struck on the back of the head is not painful it is merely a cessation of consciousness he didnt even feel his teeth bite at the ground but waking up is painful ed moved his head and knew momentary agony he groaned he rolled over and sat up slowly as if he had a glass neck there was no blood the kid had used the flat of the barrel his wallet was gone of course he walked back toward the town no cars passed him twice he rested in the weedchoked ditch finally he came to a drivein root beer stand but it was closed funny then he passed a roadside cafe closed too maybe they were mennonites or something a street angled off the highway flanked by a small park with a war memorial in the center and coollooking grass under the hardwoods coming toward him in the early dusk was a boy with a loaf of bread under his arm wheres the sheriffs office in this town asked ed the boy went into a halfcrouch holding his loaf of bread like a club with his fingers sunk deeply into the garish waxedpaper wrapper  you  you get away he shrieked then he dropped the bread and took off across the street like a scalded cat ed shook his head a nut at the next intersection was a barbers candystriped pole and a water fountain with a mongrel snuffling around in front of it could have been holyoke except for the deserted streets stooping for water at the fountain ed saw his refection in the barbers windows maybe it wasnt so strange the kid had run a big dark paunchy man unshaven eyes abnormally bright shirt ripped trousers muddied on the corner was a twostory red brick building that could have been the jail a little girl about five leading a puppy by a string tied to

off im still not supposed to talk 65 to strangers honey if youd cindy run honey ed whirled a tall handsome woman in a grey tailored suit had rounded the corner in front of the brick building run quick to mommy as the girl fled ed heard the clatter of running feet from the alley thank god a cop officer the policeman hit him right in the middle exactly like a lineman hitting a quarterback who is about to throw eds right elbow struck the sidewalk sickeningly he tried to push the frenzied man away but the woman kicked him in the neck from behind strong hands jerked him up with momentary strength he lashed out and the policeman fell away bruised mouth gaping ed caught the glint of a fivepointed star pinned to the khaki shirt of the man behind him he had found the sheriff for the second time that evening something struck him crushingly across the back of the head out out cold    got him huh thats right mr kraley right in front of the jail ed opened his eyes he was slumped in a straightback chair in the center of a bare windowless room with his hands shackled behind his back the man who belonged to the voice was talking on a wall phone beside the door he was a potbellied policeman with a badlybruised jaw ya he said into the phone the sheriffs daughter her ma stopped in here to ask walt if hed be home at all tonight and ya i thought of that too thats why i called a man in khakis wearing a badge came through the door the fat cop hung up hurriedly the sheriff was built much like ed except his stomach was flatter and he had an aquiline nose and high cheek bones stand up he said ed stood up a heavy fist lashed out at his belly he grunted and fell on the floor he vomited the man in khakis watched him unmoved thats for cindy he said somehow ed got his feet under him his clothes reeked of the mess he had made there was no fight whatsoever in him he no longer wondered why wilson had not resisted the mob which had dragged him from his cell i have to warn you that

holyoke labresch said what car mister you tell a good story and ill grant you dont look the type though i guess they never do but what am i supposed to have done a door slammed heavily and a huge man wearing dark trousers and a wilted white shirt with his tie pulled askew burst into the room his sleeves were rolled up over enormously hairy arms and he smelled strongly of stale sweat he had a cruellyhooked nose and his mouth was a trap is this the bastard one big arm tried to sweep labresch out of the way labresch wouldnt sweep let me at him walt ill fix his water you arent fixing anything alderman youre on the town council you know violence doesnt solve anything who told you wed picked anyone up clarence called as quick as you brought him in labresch swore under his breath then laid a

dont you think youre better off over there with your wife we arent even sure this mans the one who hes a stranger aint he he tried for cindy and made a grab for the harris kid over in the park didnt

tailkicking contest before he thought ed burst out you cant let them take me youre the sheriff dont you think ive thought of that thank god the troopers are coming what about tear gas there aint any labresch raised his voice clarence hey clarence get in here ed had been aware of a mutter of sound from the street outside it was already swelling in volume he could see through the door and across the outside office against the panes of the street windows was an uneasy smoky flickering he knew only too well torches clarence where in the hell the upper panes of one of the windows shattered inward and a brick thudded on the floor clarence shouted labresch again douse every light in the place some damn fools sure to have a gun another brick smashed through a window and then as if cued by his voice a shot rang out and a slug whined into the wall labresch ran into the next room and the lights went out abruptly there was a cheer from outside ed followed him to the door clarence bugged out said labresch he was crouched behind the desk dialling the phone into it he said this is labresch again listen where areyou mean clarence didnt call you at all dammit get some men over here right away ive got a mob on my hands and    ten minutes that long well all i can do is try to hold them he hung up and looked at ed im going out to reason with them stay down dont try anything cute theyre all around the building if you go out theyll pick you to pieces ed nodded to show he understood there was little he could do with his hands shackled labresch unlocked the front door and stepped out the crowd fell momentarily silent and the torches steadied okay folks the funs over go homeall of you a voice called give him to us walt youre breaking the law especially the man who fired that shot ill overlook that because i know how you feel but state troopers will be here soon and theyll arrest any man they find on the streets with his erect body and hard eyes labresch was the type of man before whom a mob instinctively hesitates and the threat of troopers had considerably sobered them for the first time ed wondered what would have happened in holyoke if the militia had been called then kraley shouted you got three minutes to hand him out walt well hurt you if you dont and then well get him anyway labresch stepped back inside and shot the bolt as he passed the desk he scooped up a sawedoff shotgun and began ramming shells into it a shower of bricks and stones was rattling against the front of the building like monstrous hail the flickering torches danced vast menacing shadows on the walls through the glassless windows kraley had tipped them over the edge they wanted blood now they wanted the blood of ed brandeis ed was scared it was so damned unfair he deserved a chance to be heard two minutes walt kraleys voice was almost lost in the bedlam from the desk labresch said without humor someones been watching tv again the phone lines been cut fascinated ed stared at the big clock across the room ticking off the seconds of his life from the street kraleys voice shouted the death of another minute labresch checked the shotgun again and started for the front door for gods sake said ed hoarsely im not the one they want youve got to believe me im an innocent man in his mind wilson grinned in bony delight i dont believe you but what the hell difference would it make if you were innocent you mean youyou arent giving me to them i dont believe in many things mister but i believe in the law same as another man believes in his religion these people elected me to enforce the law and dammit thats what i got to do he already was going out the door when kraley shouted with a voice that shook the torches times up walt the sheriff ducked out and slammed the thick oak door behind him the mobs forward surge faltered under the menace of his shotgun labreschs grimlydetermined face stood out starkly in the torch light high cheekbones and glittering eyes accenting his probable frenchindian blood this mans in legal custody and anyone who there was a single flat unechoing report the slug knocked him back against the heavy door and dropped him to his knees kraley waved his arm like a squad leader starting into combat but he only made two paces i said hes in legal custody stand right there kraley labreschs voice was weaker more dangerous because it was thinned to the breaking point the dark stain was spreading rapidly across his shirt come on kraley shouted no one moved labreschs unwavering shotgun seemed to point at every mans navel several stragglers stealthily backed away then the man next to kraley threw down his torch at the same instant the thin wail of sirens came from the highway dark shapes suddenly broke and exploded in all directions like flushed quail kraley hesitated staring about him numbly then he threw away his torch and lumbered for the shadows labresch fell forward heavily on his face his shotgun struck the cement steps and clattered down discharging both barrels the shot ripped large patches from the deserted blacktop i wish hed known said ed brandeis sitting on a corner of the sheriffs desk he sipped cold coffee glass crunched when he shifted his foot i wish hed found out that i wasnt the one the state trooper wore a very natty twotone blue uniform and was young with straight blond hair cut short and the sort of physique that a uniform flatters so what if hed known hed have been just as dead it might have made a difference said ed stubbornly if that crazy kid had cracked up your car an hour sooner that would have made a difference or if that clarence had phoned us when he was supposed to the erect handsome chestnuthaired woman came out of the smaller room where labreschs body had been laid out on a cot her eyes were red but her voice was quite steady why did he have to do it mr brandeis he had everything to live for and    and ed licked his lips he was suddenly very glad that they didnt know about wilson he was wearing a badge mrs labresch he said heavily i want him back i want him back so very much she passed a hand across her eyes even though you werent the man they wanted i wish walt had let them take you im sorry but its true staring at her uncomprehending grief ed surprised himself by saying i wish he had too then he turned abruptly away id like to get some sleep now sure mr brandeis said the trooper you can give us your deposition later im sorry about your car i dont give a damn about that ed stopped at the head of the stairs beneath his feet was the freshlyscrubbed place where walt labresch had bled there were tiny scars on the cement where the shotgun had clattered down funny he had left holyoke to get away from it but its never that easy he descended to the deserted shadowy street the air was fresh and wild with the mississippi river smell that no man could ever change as he walked aimlessly down the sidewalk in the mornings cool pale dawning ed brandeis wondered if he would ever lose his secret feeling of shame 
the lover
my husband remembered that he too had chewed tar as a boy it was good for the teeth too charles went on to say it made the teeth real white i liked the taste too in fact i used to swallow the juice my husband placed his bare white arm alongside charles deeper colored one and in a mockserious tone said well now that accounts for the difference in our colors you swallowed more juice than i did we all had a good laugh about this and forgot it taking the conversation into other channels but my eightyearold daughter it developed took the whole thing very seriously the next day my little girl and her friend came in from play with black stains over their hands and beneath their fingernails the expressions on their faces reflected profound disappointment somewhat concerned i asked my daughter what was wrong we tried it mom she explained looking sadly up at me we ate the tar and it didnt even work we the adults were amused but our hearts were touched by our little tar babies who saw so much love in our friend that they wanted to be like him this kind of love imagines no color barrier but reaches out in response to that which is real within everyone christs love reaching out through each of us is the answer

t was monday the 25th of february in 1895 and at the douglass es tate in anacostia d c the great statesman was to leave his beloved cedar hill for the last time only five days before he had left his home going down the snowcovered path to the big open meeting of the national council of women in washington where he had greeted his old friend susan b anthony returning to cedar hill from that meeting in good spirits the aged warrior recounted the events of the meeting to his wife helen pitts douglass had been an ardent feminist even before she married frederick so that it was natural that she would be interested in the progress of the womens suffrage movement her husband said that the womens suffrage movement was in many respects a continuation of the antislavery movement and that the freedom of women was but an extension of the freedom of the negro a forerunner to the complete emancipation of all people during the recounting of mrs anthonys comments helen douglass noticed that her husband seemed a little tired and then he fell moments later he was dead the career that had begun in a slave cabin on the eastern shore of maryland was ended the name of frederick douglass of course was known throughout the length and breadth of this country as well as abroad he never knew exactly when he was born but he assumed from other events that it was sometime in february 1817 about 1841 he escaped from his master and shortly after began to lecture on the evils of slavery under the auspices of the massachusetts antislavery society his eloquence was such that he soon became widely known as an oratora man of true and moving power his autobiography published in 1845 so enraged slaveholders that even in a free state he was in danger so that he fled to england where he continued lecturing in the cause of abolition kind english friends collected money and purchased his freedom thus enabling him to return in safety to the us where with backing from his english benefactors he founded the north star the antislavery paper he had dreamed of editing the paper was issued weekly from rochester n y until slavery was abolished a friend of william lloyd garrison and of john brown douglass continued to grow in power and influence when the civil war began president lincoln sought his advice in the use of negroes as soldiers and after that douglass helped to enlist men in the 54th massachusetts regiment the first regiment of negro soldiers from the north after the war he moved to washington and for several years edited the new national era another weekly newspaper later he served the us government as marshal recorder of deeds for the district and finally as minister to haiti he continued to work on his autobiography and each new edition brought it further along the final publication is titled the life and times of frederick douglass even in his final years he was erect carrying his massive white bearded head on broad shoulders with vigor and great dignity now frederick douglass slave orator editor abolitionist marshal of the district of columbia commissioner to santo domingo and minister to haiti president of the freedmens bank and one of the greatest americans of any agelay in the parlor of cedar hill in a large oaken casket serenely at rest cedar hill the 14acre douglass estate sits proudly on the crest of a hill overlooking washington and the potomac river the 20room white colonialstyle brick and stucco house is surrounded by the lofty oaks and cedars which give it its name and this last morning a fresh snow had covered the already fallen snow to give to douglass beloved home and grounds a new mantle for his departure the rev hugh stevenson of the local anacostia baptist church had come up the hill to conduct a private funeral service for the family before the body was removed to metropolitan ame church in washington the widow came into the dim parlor and took a seat in the small circle of chairs that had been arranged in a semioval facing the casket a small woman she seemed to have contained her emotions behind a stoic new england calm only the bloodless knuckles of her hands which she clasped tightly together indicated the stress she had undergone in the days since her husband fell dead at her feet douglass son lewis and her two daughters estella and hattie sprague and charles son joseph now joined mrs douglass in the semicircle it had been no secret that this second white wife of frederick douglass had never been accepted by the douglass children and grandchildren however there had never been any question in douglass mind that he had done the right thing in marrying helen from the beginning when his old friend francis j grimke had protested that such a marriage was suicide douglass had not wavered i should be false to all the purposes and principles of my life if i did not marry this noble lady who has done me the honor to consent to be my wife he replied i am a free man i am free even of making appearances just to impress would it not be ridiculous if after having denounced from the housetops all those who discriminate because of the accident of skin color i myself should practice the same folly 76 but antipathies were for the occasion ignored and now the family kneeled together in prayer for the man they all loved deeply the brief prayer over the family listened in silence as reverend stevenson read from the scriptures then the great casket was closed the bitter cold of the past week had abated somewhat and a light snow still fell as the casket was removed to be taken into washington to the metropolitan ame church for the services to be held later in the day the family retired behind the solid doors of cedar hill thus began the day on which frederick douglass funeral was held in washington d c the damp and penetrating cold did not deter the unhappy throngs that milled through the streets around the funeral site the metropolitan ame church had been selected for the services primarily for its ability to cope with the hundreds of persons expected to attend the services douglass detachment to organized religion had caused him to be accused of atheism and he was constantly contrasting the behavior of socalled christians who did not practice the brotherhood and charitable love they preached with free thinkers such as garrison and ingersoll he often said how unfortunate it was for many pious souls hate the negro while they think they love the lord wisely the reverend j t jenifer minister of metropolitan understood that douglass was in spirit a free religionist who trusted in a divine providence and had no uneasiness about his personal relationship with god jenifer was happy that metropolitan had been selected for the funeral though frederick douglass was not a member of any church by ten oclock that morning the street outside the church was clogged with carriages and people as the time for th services approached the crowd increased to such proportions that passage was almost impossible those who were fortunate enough to have the small white cards of invitation were admitted to the church early the general public was not admitted until after the beginning of the services palms and ferns were banked about the main altar where the casket was placed the great figure leonine even in death was surrounded by floral offerings from heads of state politicians and friends from around the world on the casket a simple spray of lilies from helen since the evening in january 1884 when helen pitts 46yearold white spinster had become mrs frederick douglass their love mutual interest and understanding had forged a bridge that covered the difference in their years as well as their race at that time helen had said love came to me and i was not afraid to marry the man i loved because of his color now widowed she had those years of happi ness and fulfillment to sustain her she would have preferred a simple service but she realized that frederick belonged to the people whom he had spent his life in serving so she kept silent it was nearly two oclock in the afternoon before the funeral procession filed into the church first the family followed by the honorary pallbearers former u s senator blanche k bruce he and his wife stood up with helen and frederick when they were married w h wormley john r lynch john e cook exgov of louisiana p b s pinchback john r francis f g barbadoes d l pitcher john h brooks dr c b purvis former head of freedmens hospital the son of abolitionist robert purvis who with douglass had been one of the prime movers in the american antislavery society and congressman george w murray among the notables in attendance were justice john marshall harlan the famous dissenter in the civil_rights cases of 1893 and the later plessy v ferguson harlans dissenting opinions are still cited by lawyers and laymen who reject the validity of these decisions senators sherman and hoars and a number of members of the house of representatives judge and mrs robert mary church terrell susan b anthony a large delegation from the womens council and dr daniel hale williams the new head of freedmens hospital and a distant kinsman of the great fallen leader finally all were seated and the services began the choir started softly with nearer my god to thee followed by a prayer for the soul of the deceased by the rev fr alexander crummell of st lukes episcopal church the choir now in full voice sang in thy cleft o rock of ages then bishop alexander wayman a pioneer in the african methodist movement in the south and a contemporary of douglass from the eastern shore of maryland read the nineteenth psalm his full and rich voice hung in the air as the last words of the psalm were uttered    let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in they sight o lord my strength and my redeemer now reverend jenifer began the delivery of the funeral sermon douglass beliefs were too well known to be ignored so reverend jenifer stated flatly frederick douglass was a christian he broke with the american church and with the american christian dogma when he saw that it sanctioned and sustained the enslavement and the bondage of a brother he held christ to be above creed and above the church this explained he then continued with the traditional eulogy following jenifers sermon reverend stevenson of the anacostia baptist church and dr j e ran78 kin president of howard university read tributes to the dead the remarks of the haitian minister to the united states were interpreted by the former u s minister to haiti j l durham then the aging susan b anthony spoke of douglass and his labors in behalf of the negro vote and his championing of womens rights then john hutchinson of boston now extremely aged with snowy beard and long white hair reaching down to his shoulders recalled the days when the hutchinson family the minnesingers of american freedom accompanied frederick in the tours of new england seeking converts to the doctrine of abolition then in his frail voice he sang the abolition song that his brother jesse had dedicated to douglass years before ill be free ill be free and none shall confine with fetters and chains this spirit of mine from my youth i have vowed in god to rely and despite the oppressor gain freedom or die when his voice was still even the most composed and reconciled eyes were moist now the benediction was pronounced by bishop williams of the colored methodist episcopal church in south carolina by now it was after five oclock and the winter sky had darkened instead of diminishing the crowd had grown so that it was nearly impossible for the funeral procession to make its way to the waiting carriages the negro letter carriers of the district escorted the body to the depot where it was placed on the 710 train for rochester n y reaching there the following morning helen lewis charles rosetta and the three grandchildren accompanied the body the family truce lasted throughout the period of the funeral rochester was in mourning it was nearly 10 oclock before the cortege of the former distinguished resident of rochester left the depot for the city hall this was helens home as well as fredericks but she had never lived with him here as his wife it was anna who had been the wife of frederick douglass in rochester and the house on alexander street had been his underground railway station headquarters douglass had been proud that no united states marshal had ever taken a fugitive slave from rochester so to rochester he returned accompanying the body to the city hall where it lay in state for several hours were the mayor members of the common council and other city officials and the honorary pall bearers the douglass league of rochester moving from the city hall to the central presbyterian church the hearse wound through endless lines of silent spectators following the invocation by r h h stebbins and the eulogies a male quartet sang hail thou me   helen recalled that douglass had hummed the tune the day before he died then the organist played swing low sweet chariot and as the funeral cortege made its way from the church the ninth symphony of beethoven filled the building    helen had the last word with this sound in their ears the mourners made their slow way to mount hope cemetery here frederick douglass was laid to rest  
why i became an actor
by sidney poitier
interviewer what made you decide to be an actor poitier what made me decide to be an actor well i decided to become an actor because i had tried a great many other things i had no skilled trade so the things i tried all were of aworkingwithyourhands style and it bored me quickly all of it i was a ditch digger a dish washer a car washer a porterand these are for me very boring activities always have been one day i found in a newspaper a negro newspaper specifically the amsterdam news the new york amsterdam news on the advertisement page an ad saying actors wanted and i figured having tried everything else you knowand i was quite young i figured what the hell ill give this a go i went ahead and i told them i was an actor and they said read something for us well i read very poorly they threw me out promptly my pride was hurt terribly hurt i had never been rejected so so forcefully before and i said to myself well dammit ill show them ill read good for them so i set out on a sixmonth campaign of trying to orientate my speech of trying to gather a kind of onedimensional understanding of the theatre and gather certain catch phrases theatre phrases such as whatever you use if you are an inperson in the theatre and i went back and thats how i became an actor interviewer why is it that acting had appealed to you at all had you been to plays poitier no i had not been to plays i thought that actors made good money and i wanted to make money and i also wanted to do something other than manual labor you see i was illequipped to do anything else but manual labor i thought here is a field that probably i could take hold in you know if im lucky rather than having to expose myself to five or six years of training in a school for a special craft or trade for which i didnt have the money or the time i figured i would have a go at this also i was footloose and fancyfree i was moving about in the world you know i had no great responsibilities i was young and i had thei had the freedom and the prerogative to walk off a job as a porter if i didnt like it or it bored me to tears i was a great daydreamer i would wind up leaving the job and going and sitting near the water or in central park and just dream all day interviewer about what poitier oh about things people and mostly about  i think our dreams are usually made of the yearnings and needs unfulfilled you know so we go about trying to fulfill them interviewer i understand that you bought a radio and for six months you studied the diction of people you heard on it poitier i studied the diction of people on the radio because my speech was obviously west indian and not as clear or as cultivated as one needs to have it for theatre work i couldnt go to a school as a matter of fact i didnt know there was such a thing as a school for speech so i bought magazines and i would listen to the radio and i would repeat what i heard on the radio most news broadcasts and in time my speech began to lighten in the areas where it was particularly broad interviewer i was told that when you returned for an audition you brought one of the magazines you had studied to read from poitier yes true confessions magazine and i read it i read a paragraph of it as an audition as a scene plays and all that jazzi was fairly ignorant about the theatre all i had was a passion to show    see in all my life although it was only a poor one and fierce one i had always had great pride and in the caribbean a young negro is never robbed of his pride as he is in some parts of the southern united states so that at the age of fifteen sixteen i wasi was fierce crude and very alive in many many senses many important senses interviewer so the rejection at the theatre was a blow to your pride poitier yes yes the rejection was a blow and a challenge you see and one that i had to accept i was told to get out of the theatre this was the american negro theatre near 135th street intervie1 er yes i know poitier i was told to get out and forget it to go back and just get a job and you see the image of whatthe image of the rejection to me was this i saw my life every subsequent year of my life i saw it in the drudgery of manual labor i saw a limit placed on my potential had i accepted the rejection as my fate then i would have been ordained to a kind of onedimensional living circumscribed by my limitations and hung in a kind of abyss of never really being able to reach beyond my grasp interviewer what else did you do to train yourself besides the reading and the radio during that sixmonth period poitier well i did a great many things in the caribbean i had gone to school for a very brief period for a year and a half and i could barely write or read however i knew certain littlei had acquired certain little hints of reading such as the phonetic way of pronunciation and if a word puzzles you you do not know its meaning you start with the first three letters et cetera et cetera so that you in turn will be able to pronounce it fairly accurately and i began to try to improve my reading you see by sight which was very hard for me but it began to improve the reason i went to a true confessions magazine primarily is because they wereaside from the fact that i didnt know anything about bookstoresthey were always very simply written and i could understand what it was saying i was not often overwhelmed by words in its structure i studied reading and i listened to the radio for speech and i used to read newspapers a great deal i didnt always know what was in them or what the articles were all about but i did know some of the words and a constant exposure to these words helped me to develop a familiarity with them so that sight and reproduction became synonymous interviewer did you use a dictionary too poitier no i did not i had a strange way of holding words that i would pronounce but did not understand their meaningholding them in abeyance for a time when i did find a sentence with the word in it so structured that i suddenly knew what it meant interviewer how many hours a day did you spend at this radio to rid yourself of the west indian accent poitier many many hours when i was working and i worked throughout this periodi worked various places i was working in the garment district for the most part evenings and mornings and whenever i could get to a magazine or a newspaper the reading was constant because i had no time for much else i had no friends the small salary from the district or wherever i worked was such that the small room i maintained and the food and the few dollars for clothingwell that was all i could afford interviewer youve made the statement that you were an actor made exclusively by friends over the years and i was curious to know whether this was a correct statement and who were the important influences upon you poitier it is a correct statement in part i am made in terms of my success by my friends people who at one time or another did me a good turn who are the friends they are varied they come from many walks of life they are people who permitted me to use them as studies they are people who are interested in my work or interested in me or interested in helpingthey are directors and writers producers and workaday folk so this though its true in part is not a definitive statement interviewer did you study other actors did you go to the theatre to watch actors our leading actors work poitier it was only in later years that i developed a kind of interest in watching other actors work in the theatre but i watched many actors work because i was always involved in class work and group work and various theatre groups that was my life you see thats where i did most of my learning i was in and out of groups and little theatres and projects i first of all couldnt afford the legitimate theatre often but i didnt take advantage of the times when i could afford it it used to bore me broadway theatre used to bore the daylights out of me until i finally became interested in certain actors there were certain actors who were my kind of actors people with great power and i would go and watch them work interviewer did you have any formal training or are you now taking formal training poitier as an actor interviewer as an actor poitier oh yes i took many years from 1946 i took formal training which is what nowfourteen years i took formal training at the american negro theatre it was training of a kind adequate for that period totally inadequate for now in 1947 48 49 50 i was always taking formal training from various people sometimes actors sometimes from a group sometimes fromsometimes for free sometimes you pay a small fee and then i eventually wound upin the 50s i wound up with the paul mann actors workshop after having taken many many years of formal training helterskelter of course but formal training interviewer paul mann as i understand it follows the stanislavsky approach to acting poitier yes interviewer are you then one of the method actors in your work or do you amalgamate method with your own methods poitier i am not a method actor i study method and i work method before i perform to explain the stanislavsky method is intended i believeand if im wrong i use it this way neverthelessi think it is intended to be used as a method of preparation for work not as a method employable in the instance of work so i use the stanislavsky method in preparing my work something which i am privileged to use over a long period of time before i go on the stage or before i go on in front of a camera which means that instead of employing the stanislavsky method for two hours a night in a theatre i employ it for two or three months in the preparation of that work so that when i go on the stage or in front of a camera my function becames organic and instant and natural spontaneous and full because i have a frame of reference for every want every need every desire that is registered on my emotion boards interviewer could you be specific here and just take us through a single part you prepared for poitier well lets take the last thing i did on the stage lets take a raisin in the sun i received the script almost a year before we went into production right and i read it naturally many many many times and i knew generally after ten or twenty readings what the circumstances of the play were i knew what the individual characters were like generally i understood my character kind of generally now i needed time to make my understanding of my character specific in so doing i must understand all of the contributing elements that go to making up this character first i must understand what are the driving forces in the man in order to understand that you must find out what are his political social economic religious milieus and how they contribute to the personality idiosyncrasies or whatever and in so examining i find that this first is a negro man thirtysix years old living in chicago on the south sidewhich of itself is quite significant in the building of a character because only a particular kind of negro lives on the south south in this particular kind of circumstances see so that narrows the field already and then we take why is this man living here is he here by choice what is his relation to his community what is his relation to his religion if he has one what is his relation to his economic disposition is it one in which he finds enough elasticity to function and maintain his manhood or it is a constant badge or remembrance of his inadequaciesyou followand all these things can be found in the script or at least if theyre not there they can be made compatible with what is in the script at one point or another so that after months of actually making specific this man in his milieuthen i come to the final conclusion of what are his wants and when i find what are his general wants i find what is his most specific want or wants i now have the man in total i know what his reaction would be to everything done and said in the playsee i know what and how he feels about his neighborhood so that any question or reference to it strikes a certain chord in a man now with this kind of information i then proceed to familiarize myself with the pros and cons of his life and his wants i try to experience them so by the time im ready to perform i dont go in a cornerat least i dont have to go in a corner and concentrate and conjure up some mysterious magic i walk on the stage and it happens and i dont work method because its too late now to work method if youre not ready forget it you walk on the stage and you find that you have taken on the milieu of the character and you then begin to seek out and fulfill the very wants that are burning inside you now which are his wants once youre on the stage you have no time because the stage is to experienceyou followthe stage is to experience    once the curtain goes up and there is an audience out there you the artist your responsibility is to experience and only through your experiencing are you able really to transmityou follow there are many kinds of actors there are actors who can get on a stage but they can never quite enthrall nor can they ever quite involve or hypnotize but they can give a workmanlike job well if theyre not gifted they dont enthrall and they dont involve because they themselves are not able to involve on the level required by the artist interviewer what is the difference between these two poitier there is a basic difference to my mind between the two and ofttimes its not because of the difference in talent its sometimesit always is the difference in the humanity of the individual you see there is a phrase used by jazz musicians and they call it soul it is a reference to a certain kind of humanityof the sensitivity of humanitythat is overstocked in one person they use the word soul because there are certain gifted brilliant musicians who have a kind of human compassion thatthey are so inarticulate in every other phase of life they can only express through their music and hence they are terribly important musicians and gifted with actors i thinkthere are actors who have not as much and there are actors who are void of it now the fine actors who are void of it are called technicians they are quite capable of making you realize you are in a theatre watching a terribly gifted technician at work and you say ahh hes marvelous if he had the added gift of soul you would forget youre in a theatre thats the difference interviewer what is it that you find you like about acting poitier that i like about acting interviewer yes but if you prefer to talk about what you dont like about acting you can do that too poitier well iyou know thats an interesting question i dont know how i can answer it interviewer what do you get from acting that satisfies you poitier thats a different question i can better answer that from acting i get a sense ofof worthwhileness i feel for instance there were times in my past when out of sheer naivete and modesty i was afraid to accept the fact that i was a gifted actor it was only in later years that i realized that the gift of an actor does not belong to him that i accepted that i am a gifted actorand cannot point to any one or group of efforts on my part that created the gift i was born with it lets be honest and lets be factual i was born with a gift i had nothing to do with it when my mother conceivedthat moment the combination of genes carried inherently whatever there was that i suddenly found at the age of seventeen or eighteen so what i get from acting is using it for others using it for people i find that when i work well people enjoy it and theythings happen to them by that i mean when i use it well they share it you see and they share it in good ways you follow and thats what ithats what i get from it interviewer you have this gift but you must do something to make yourself a better actor or a better human being or whateveror am i wrong i mean is the gift there and thats the end of it poitier no its your responsibility to nurture it its like a seed its like a plant its like a child you feed it yes you nurture it you care for it interviewer how poitier well ive tried to care for it for fourteen years first of all it is important that the actor recognize that his gift is an entity the human entityin that package so the package must be cared for not only cared for but it must be cared for in ways that become advantageous to the flowering of the gift the mind and the body are the only two tools to be cared for kept not under glass but kept in good working condition above and beyond that it must be exposed to its limits constantlyto life because it then acts as an absorption board so that when the gift has to be placed in motion you are not trying to click it over a void you need to call on experiences when you are in the process of working on a partfor instance in the preproduction in the preopening periods of a partwhen you say what kind of life did this guy lead your conclusions must be not only theoryyou follow you must be able to bridge the gap between theory and experience sometimes so that in other words to play a coal miner you can read all you want about coal mining but just to know what the feel of the area is at the entrance of a coal mine is experience thats worth more than the ten volumes youll read about it so that i dont mean that the gift is there and it just begins to kick over no you nurture it and you work with it and its your responsibility now if youre going to be an artist and this is where you say this is my functionthen thats what you are in life if you are going to be a carpenter and you go through the growing pains of learning how to measure and cut and saw and nail and then if you walk away from itafter you learn ityou cant go back to it in ten years and build a house and also when you walk away from it it is because you are notyou have not committed yourself to it i commit to the theatre i commit to art thats me im thirtythree years old i have no place else to goyou follow and the only reasons i know i amthat are of importance to meare the reasons i get from my work from my milieu as an artist and from my contribution interviewer but success tends to put you in a hothouse in a comfortable hothousedoesnt it poitier success tends to put the american artist in a hothouse and it is ajust one of the many temptations potential indulgences that the artist has to face up to interviewer but how do you grow then poitier i live in a certain way i make a great deal of money and i live in new york i live in westchester i live in a lowermiddleincome community i am not ghettoized here i can live anywhere i want to live in new york state and if they wont sell me a house ill buy the land and build a house i am not ghettoized i live in a certain way i move in every circlei have to i am interested fortunately in many things im interested in politics im interested in economics im interested in art see im interested in hunger and im interested inin oppressions im interested in the independence of the african and asian states im interested in the power of the church im interested in the lack of civil liberties in the soviet union im interested in a lot of thingsbirth control and oldage pensions assistance for the aged im interested in a lot of things and im notfortunately i am not trying to force an interest i am genuinely interested in these things so i dont i mean the success is not an end interviewer how do you choose your roles do you choose them because of the acting opportunities that are available to you or do you choose them in combination with their significance to you poitier i choose my roles nowi must differentiate because in the past i was always selective only not for snobbish reasons i was always selective because most of the parts offered me were of no interest to me and i refused them and that was that the difference now is that the parts that are offered to me if they interest me and they are not quite right i get help to fix them i look for certain things not in the part only but in the play if a play or a film has a commentmind you comment is different from a statementif a play has a comment that transcends itself then i will be interested in doing it now what do i mean by a play that transcends itself if the plays comment can be made dimensionally clearly forcefully to everyone who sees it whatever their country whatever their language as long as its a man or a woman or a child of this milieu in our contemporary worldthen the play has significance for me i do not wish to make a comment that is peculiar only to a section of this country or of this world i do not wish to make a comment that is peculiar to negroes only or on behalf of negroes only i am not interested in the comment that is on behalf of americans only i cannot any more be thusly interested i want to say if im able something about people and i believe that basically people are the same everywhere if they are literate or not if they are sophisticated rich poor russian american black whitebasically they are the same and art can touch them all in the same place you see the same piece of art can touch them all that which touches only the black man not understood by the white is really not accomplishing much because ofttimes that which is understood by the black and not by the white is poison and in and of itself it becomes contradictory to the purposes intended interviewer i was going to ask you what if any difference do you find in preparation for the stage and for the films poitier there is a difference in the preparation and there is a difference in the performance on the stage in terms of the preparation you have two months or more depending on how soon you get the script or whatever your working habits are and how important you are sometimes you get a script three four months in advance you begin working then then you have the fourweek period of rehearsals and then you have a tryout usually and then you come in prepared to work two hours a night and twice on wednesdays and saturdays in the film your preparation at least mine takes a different course there are different demands made by the two mediums the stages limitations are of a nature that they make certain kinds of demands which require adjustments in the technique or in the approach to work the film makes similar demands according to its needs and limitations in the film i prepare pretty much the same way and when i am doneafter the two months or three months of preparationwhen i am done i have to begin to work in bits and pieces on what is in essence on performance which carries over an eight or tenweek period so what i do is i begin to experience each day the total up to the point i am performing so that there is a flow now how to experience it i dont sit and go through excruciating pains i just review in my mind the flow the natural flow of events involving me to this point so that i can seque into this moment this three minutes they intend to shoot today but naturally and connectedly interviewer you find the movies harder than the stage poitier yes interviewer i understand you have said in some earlier interviews that you find that the technical intrusion of cameras bothers you poitier well thats only a part of it you see the film iswell the best way to give you an example i came here at ten oclock let us assume that this is a stage and its a performance and i come in and i spend an hour here and all that we have done this morning in this interview was actually a portion of a play but i came in and i had one continuous hour in which to perform or experience if it is a film the total when it is done will be the hour similar to what we spent here but it does not flow in that manner i will come here every day for thirtysix days and i will work with you and you will work with me and in the course of one day our total the aggregate of our film time will be three minutesyou see and each day i come i must through whatever senses awareness i possessi must thread yesterdays needle with todays thread so that it would seem that no time has elapsed that is difficult now we are able in films to get around it easily because its a very technical medium and you can cut up film and nobody really cares about the performance you know unless you yourself are interested so to make a wholethat in life in a lifelike experience will unfold in an hour or two or threeto put it together bit by bit is like patchquilt work the job of the artist if he is interested is to make it seem that this is a total experience when it is done that makes it more difficult than the stage infinitely more difficult but by the same token it is in films where if someone is not interestedthe medium is a haven because he can hide behind other things the medium permits an actor to be lazy if he wishes if he has a winning personality and a nice face to look at and a not displeasing voice he can read words and move around in an attempt at playing and get away with it easier than he can on the stage because on the stage he has only one frame you see on the screen he has the twolens and the fourlens and a fiftylens and a seventyfive lens so that his image comes to us in gears it comes that way this way you know and we see all kinds of images of him and he comes so close to us we can almost touch him on the stage he remains in the same dimension so theres nothing going for him there except his work interviewer youve been playing serious roles what about comic ones i understand from what ive been reading about you that you have a talent for comedy poitier i would like to try that very much and i am going to i am sure that it will have to be as a result of my own efforts because i am now used to being thought of as a heavy actor interviewer what do you think are the prospects for the negro actor in america poitier ah good question i think they are good if the negro actor is a gifted actor and he develops himself he will work cannot help but work there will be very few limitations on the negro actor truly gifted in the future the countrythe pace of change socially in america has accelerated so that the negro actor of today is experiencing more hope and more involvement in the theatre and in pictures than ever before television and the radio are a littlestill behind the times but picturewise its coming marvelously the stage also in music and theatre and art generally the power of the gift is what counts for the most part another artist who is white if he is committed to art and he finds a gift in a black man or woman he has to use it he has to work with ityou followbecause that is his commitment like in musici dont care how sick a white musician who is dedicated to music is on the race question he would go out of his skull to play with miles davis he would go out of his skull to play with him so that directors and writers producers even who are really interested in working on a certain artistic level if they find an actor who is a mexican actor or a white actor or a black actor or a chinese actor who has great power they have to use him now on a workaday level lots has yet to be accomplished for the actor who is just soso the soso negro actor will not work with the consistency that the soso white actor works because the negro is unfortunately still in that kind of social thing but there is hope there is much hope the salvation of the negro actor also will be realized through the realization of negro writers in the theatre all kinds of good things are pointing to it interviewer what advice would you give to the beginning negro actor in terms of training for the stage poitier i would give him the same advice that i would give to the beginning actor of any other race and that is to study hard and long and fierce if you control the methods of work then you can in essence control your growth or help to control your growth if you are unable to control the body or the mind under certain work situations then youll find that youll never be able to play any one part completely the only tools you have areis the body how you move how you speak everything you do with the body becomes the essence of your work aside from learning the other aspects of acting controlling the body is the most important interviewer i vould like to extend the question a little bit i accept the fact that the advice you would give would be regardless of color but i wonder in terms of psychological or philosophical approach or attitudehow would you guide a young negro actor so that he doesnt become embittered let us say at lack of opportunity poitier let him become embittered i think that bitterness is also a fruit of life if bitterness was an end result directed toward no one else then we wouldnt mind bitterness we object to bitterness because we dont wish to be the object of it i think that bitterness is an absolutely correct reaction to some of the absurdities perpetuated on negroes in this country i will not say to a young negro actor dont become bitter if he earns the right to be bitter by god let him be bitter i do say to him earn the right to be bitter go and prepare yourself to be an artist and if you become an artistif you are on your way to realizing your potential as an artistand some bastards superimpose restrictions on your efforts get as bitter as you wantyou follow interviewer on the other hand bitterness in your own private life can be a disturbing element isnt there some approach to peace with yourself  poitier are you asking if there is a way to tranquilize oneself against the intrusions of all the injustices no there isnt any way to tranquilize oneself what the negro actor should do or the negro person per se should do is not to be concerned about bitterness because it is an experience and out of it usually comes some very profound constructive philosophical attitudeusually you see and it is not essentially an adjustment because if the persons who are so busy creating these obstacles for minorities in this country if they themselves ever were to experience what those people the minorities go through they would be better human beings themselves i believe that you cannot be full in this life until you know what pain is until you know what joys are and instead of spending a lifetime like most whites in this country running from pain setting up an antiseptic life struggling and working and closing out nailing out all the adversitiespain and a little hardship and struggleand becoming essentially antiseptic  i think that the more antiseptic they become the more lack of soul becomes evident so i have no great horror for bitterness on the part of negroes negroes are becoming less bitter and its marvelous that they are but the experience of bitterness has beenwill beused by them in marvelous ways you know the venom of a snake can kill and it can also be an antidote correct so i dont want to say to negroes dont be bitter if they are in a situation that provokes the bitterness let them be bitter and when the situation through their effort or through the collective effort of both sides is overcome when they overcome the bitterness then they have a frame of reference then theyve had that experience you see and it is the experience that will make of them the better manif they overcome it if they get through it do you follow interviewer i was going to ask you do you think that a negro star of your stature has problems different from the problems of a white star of your stature poitier im sure that some of my problems are peculiar to negroes but i donti dont let them bug me sometimes some of the things are painfulnot too often sometimes they hurtnot too often i dont worry about it its an experience now and usually i am ablethrough my transcending my bitternessto some extent i am able to view very compassionately the inadequacies the gigantic limitations that enmesh the perpetuators of these moments of pain for me and i do dismiss them for they are afflicted infinitely more than i interviewer living here in mount vernon and raising your children herehow do you equate this experience poitier i have an interest in not losing my balance and i also have an interest in keeping my children in a certain kind of multiracial cultural milieu and i fear antiseptic living i fear it it leads to alcohol and nicotine and a kind of stagnation intellectually and im not interested in that interviewer i read also that you dont let them know too much about your success is that true poitier yes the magnitude of my good fortune commercially is nothing whatever for them to be dealing with at this time in their lives i wish them always to have a frame of reference for everything and if they have a father who is so unlike other fathers it will begin to give them a kind of orientation that can be unhealthy its my feeling that my childrenfirst let them be children and let them be children as fully as they can be children you see and theyll deal with what their father is and theyll have toprobably have toovercome it at a later time interviewer what are the frustrations of the negro actorthat is in the ability to use the full range of his talents poitier what are the frustrations of the negro actor interviewer i mean have you yet encountered frustrations as a negro actor in being limited let us say to certain roles poitier no honestly not yet i am entering now into an area careerwise where i am sure i will bei will be involved with the frustrations because i am now interested in the kind of work as i described to you before of a certain reach and if i am not offered it i will have to try to bring about its realization by myself meaning ill produce it myself so i havent really experienced it yet ive been busy building a career and trying not to make too many outlandish compromises but now im interested in moving on to another level interviewer what is that level actually poitier well first a level of workand a level of comment they are not necessarily compatible if you must mix them but they each represent individually a step up from what has been the pattern for many years on the artistic side there is now an urgent need to do better work i think i have the potential for better work so i now must stretch    interviewer what do you consider better work how do you consider an actor should progress in his career poitier better work for me now would beat least ive thought it would beto reach for a level of work that is commensurate with say another dimension in acting as in all art there is a constant reaching for another depth well the frame of reference for your trying to plumb the depths is to bring about a dimension that is almost indistinguishable from reality you see so that    and that is a big task but it is interesting enough to me if i never come close it would at least permit me cause mein reaching for it to stretch myself artistically there is a dimension not yet tampered with at least by me and that is to be able to work on a parin such a way that when the experience happens it has about it an encompassing effect on an audience encompassing in that they become a part of the total so that there is not a theatre and there is not a stage now this is done in many other fields you see it is done quite often by musicians you can sit down and listen to music and in no time your mind stops thinking about business it stops and it isnt even concentrating on the music it sort of suspends itself and for a while there is nothing but a kind of total moment with the music and you and the nothingness it happens when we are speaking about something that interests us fiercely and especially when someone is saying what we want to hear we become hypnotized with our eyes wide open and we arewe are hung you see i think actors can weave this spell because in the old days storytellers wove these spells in market places all over the world hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago not with the aid of lights and sets and all that jazz so the actor can do it interviewer going back to a raisin in the sun i recall that mr atkinson in the times said that you were as effective when you had words to say as when you were silent obviously you conveyed that excitement from many directions you have much encouragement in achieving your goal  poitier well see how the next step goes interviewer i gather that you are studying shakespeare that you have hopes to perform in shakespeare is that true poitier that is no longer true interviewer why is that poitier well i am i was interested in shakespeareveryand then i found a very interesting truth and it is thisi found i was interested in shakespeare because of a kind of coercion interviewer a coercion poitier yes i was coerced into an interest in shakespeare by the awesomeness of its reputation by the correctness of a man of my position having to at one point or another say that i would like to play shakespeare it is the thing to do and it is the comment to make and i started reading it and i kept saying id like to play shakespeare but it seems to be actually a status symbol toto reach a point where you can say all right i want to play shakespeare i dont want to play shakespeare essentially first because i am not trained sufficiently to play shakespeare most of shakespeares stuff bores me to tears i enjoy infinitely more to read the words because the man was indeed a geniusjust to read the structure of his sentences i lie in bed with a shakespeare book and have a ball to play it im not interested its that simple interviewer thats a very sound confession i think that even in writing to reach beyond your interests is purely a form of snobbism poitier now it would be reaching beyond my interests if i do change my mind because of additional information or because of additional changes in my values ill play it i will begin to prepare again to play it but as of now i am in a period where i would much prefer just to read it just to read it because to read it is an experience its very wonderful its relaxing and itsits a kind of freedom you experience reading it to realize that a mind or a man was so gifted to put words together in this order it is fantastic interviewer why is it that youve concentrated your energiesand this may be an obvious or rhetorical question or maybe even naive but i think that it should be asked and i think i know part of the answer but why is it that youve confined your interests to hollywood in opposition to the stage poitier because i have three children and one on the way by the way and a wife a mother and father a motherinlaw and various and sundry other relations who are not as fortunate as i and who in some manner or other depend on me for livelihood i cannot work long under the constant pressure of or the call of the economic so i am doing my two years in hollywood style my deals are so constructed that two more jobs and my relatives and i will not have to respond economically to pressuremeaning that its a tricky business and i understand it very well the business of it if i have no money and wish to remain in the theatre i must fight a constant battle of integrity versus the icebox you see i find it disconcerting to do that if i have to do it because of my circumstances are such then i would do it but i have seen a way to circumvent its being a constant thorn in my side when my success came as fledgling as it is my representatives and i sat down and we determined to get me a work relation with the people i work for of a nature that i can be paid over a long period of time rather than to take monies up front so my monies now areand its all legal taxwisepaid to me in a livable sum on the first of january every year for twentyfive years which leaves me free of that consideration so that after the picture in paris and one additional job of work which is in early spring i can do as much theatre for as long as i wish anywhere in the world interviewer can we expect you next season in the theatre poitier you can very well expect me next season interviewer there is something on the way poitier there are some things being talked about i do want to go on the stage but not to the exclusion of films i want    but see simply if you are offered one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a job thats an awful lot of money and they give it to you and the government gets sixty thousand dollars your agent gets fifteen thousand dollars thats seventyfive thousand dollars the state of california gets three or five and the state of new york gets and this gets and that gets so you wind up with about thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars now the forty thousand dollars if you live at a clip of ten thousand dollars a year lasts you four years but if you have one hundred fifty thousand dollars and the government permits you to spread that money and you take twenty thousand dollars a year thats seven and a half years then you do another film for the same company and you stretch the seven and a half years to fifteen then you work for another company and you take ten for fifteenyou see interviewer i know you rejected a role in a filmthat phenix city story roleand i wanted to know a little more about why you rejected it poitier the role was a cheat in the context of what the film dealt with the part was a cheat and a compromise it was a lie an absolute outandout lie and they used it in an uncourageous manner it was the part of a young negro father during the political and criminal holocaust in phenix city alabama or phenix city somewhere in the south and its an open city gambling and corruption and this father because he worked for somebody or did something his daughter was killed and thrown on the lawn and the father goes out hunting for the killer and toward the end of the film he comes across him and hes got him in a shed and hes gonna kill him and they put in his mouth the most ugly compromise if it were an honest change of heart the man had it could have been beautiful because it would have shown great growth you see but they put in his mouth such crappy words like i suddenly realize that the lord doesnt want me to do this interviewer and they wouldnt change it to meet your ideas poitier i was at that time a sevenhundredfiftydollar actor for the whole thingyou know three weeks for the seven hundred fifty dollars i was making two hundred dollars a week or three hundred dollars a week interviewer what has been your favorite role poitier my favorite there is no such thing interviewer then which was the most challenging role lets put it that way and why poitier again there is no such thing there is no easy part to play really i used to think there was but there isnt during the work every part even when youre having a miserable time is an important part because it is a challenge to you whatever the extenuating circumstances aresuch as a bad director or a disinterested group of fellow actors the product the finished product becomes a challenge because you have a job of work that has to be done that has to be good and you know that you can work good so that each job has to like be up to snuff you know you must notch up another so however you feel about the part there is that kind of sense ofyou do what you have to do and if you fail its sickening so each parteven the ones that you look back in retrospect and say i didnt like itat least the working on it was as honest as any other there is no enthusiasm for a part only when you have no interest in the play you see and i dont work like that i work with enthusiasm because i am interested in the things i do and when i work at it i work as fully as i can interviewer you said before that its important for the artist to experience and to live do you make it your business for instance to study people of all colors and races do you return to harlem to refresh your memory and experience of what life in harlem is like do you go out to chicago or go down south to keep in touch with the problems and experiences of people of your race poitier i do not only with people in harlemi go to harlem almost every day i have friends there and i am there almost every day i go in two guises i go as myself and sometimes i goi go as anonymously as i can and its an experience but its a very rewarding one it keeps me alive in certain areas of my consciousness let me explain harlem to you in harlem i am not a stranger nor am i a
