did the south win the civil war
by howard n meyer
t he initial phase of the civil war centennial commemorative program had its climax on april  at charleston s c with a national assembly of participating organizations the opening sale of a u s postage stamp designed to mark the firing on fort sumter and the dedication of a monument to the southerner who fired the first shot at his countrys flag a century ago the commission which is presiding over the commemorative program was quietly created in  by a congress dominated by southern democrats its membership was appointed by president eisenhower vicepresident nixon and house speaker sam rayburn this group has arranged the details of a fouryear historical pageant the importance of which cannot be overlooked it will influence tremendously the attitude of millions of young americansespecially school childrentoward the war its causes and its effects one is first tempted to say that the commissions plans have been marked by a kind of equal treatment reverence as much for the stars and bars as for the stars and stripes honor as much for jefferson davis as for abraham lincoln tributes for the boys in gray as much as the boys in blue equality that is for all except the negro but actually the union hasnt received equal treatment there was a reenactment of lincolns inaugural and thats all on the confederate side there has been a celebration of the shots fired on the star of the north a u s naval relief ship for sumter a recreation of the confederate constitutional convention and a week of festivities to celebrate the memory of the inauguration of jefferson davis with  the man and the hour pageant with a cast of  antebellum style shows and mansion tours commemoration ball costume all this was happily announced under the signature of general  u s grant iii chairman of the commission and grandson of the soldier who crushed the rebellion chairman grant is eighty years old and apparently still accepts the ideology that prevailed during his turnofthecentury youth that northsouth reconciliation is more important than the human rights of the negro the relationship of the civil war to civil_rights is of course intimate ironic and tragic yet it was privately decided in the centennial planning to suppress all reference to the moral and political issues at stakeand decided one had thoughtin the war the commission revealed in a report to congress in  which went unchallenged that the heirs of the secessionists in the state governments of the south were to control the ideological content of all ceremonies such observances should not be directed from washington they should spring into being in response to the wish of the people in each political subdivision the result was that as may be seen in the plans unfolding now only military events and human tragedy are to be commemorated not the extension of american liberty to all men the commissions policies are accurately expressed in its only widely distributed publication a booklet for public information called facts about the civil war this slickpaper twocolor brochure in which the stars and bars of the confederacy on the inside front cover dominates the stars and stripes only slightly resembles nothing so much as a souvenir program for a northsouth stadium extravaganza there is even a section describing the military forces of  under the caption the starting lineups it is what the brochure does not say however rather than what it does that is most important a man from mars or stanleyville or vientiane after reading the twenty pages of this factpacked product of the commission would not know that the war was about anything the word negro is not used nor is it mentioned that human slavery was involved in the conflict although the brochure offers a compendium of every conceivable type of statistic about the war the reader will not learn that negro soldiers made up twelve per cent of the victorious northern army and that they sustained eighteen per cent of the union fatalities there is no mention in the nine pages of detailed statistical summary of the hundred and twenty negro infantry regiments nor of the twentytwo negro artillery regiments nor of the seven negro cavalry regiments that helped defeat the rebellion until a quarter of a century ago there would have been nothing surprising about the choice of values made by the commission even today many school textbooks throughout the country are oriented to blame an unnecessary civii war on the abolitionists and to rationalize the secession as forced by the fanaticism of northern statesmen like charles sumner it is not often mentioned that the negro wanted freedom and that he helped to fight for it then too the conventional textbook blames the postreconstruction subjugation of the southern negro on the victim who was ignorant and did not know what to do with freedom all this is a byproduct of the white souths counterattack which by  had completed an ideological conquest of the north and a socioeconomic reconquest of the southern negro this postwar conquest by the white south seemed impregnable until a few short years ago the herald of its certain and final defeat was the desegregation decision of the supreme court of  which wiped out the memory of an earlier courts acceptance of jim crow but while segregationwith all its implicationshas been defeated and is in retreat it has not surrendered and the harsh fact of everyday life in the deep south is that the white minority favoring resistance to the authority of the united states and rebellion against the constitutional warrant of the supreme court still rules attempts to bring about a token beginning of compliance with the courts ruling have been brought to a standstill in virginia the presence of a governorcongressman from that state as vicechairman of the centennial commission may in part prehaps account for the makeup of the following portion of the description given in the chairmans name of the nature of the centennial what will the civil war centennial be like it will last four years battles will be reenacted many on a huge scale colorful ceremonies will be held exhibitions of war trophies and mementos organized there will be memorials parades new historical markers and a great many special ceremonies    virginia which played so great a role in the war is building a  centennial center at richmond the capital of the confederacy and restoring and marking its historic battlefields one of the most famous is that of bull run next summer the sights and sounds of the yearold battle will be recreated some  men will restage the battle for an audience that will include the president the governor of virginia and many other dignitaries general lees memorable cry will once more ring out over that historic field there stands jackson like a stone wall rally behind the virginians  the stone wall of  it might be said is one that keeps little children out of the schools that the constitution has been held to entitle them to attend for it has been estimated that if school desegregation continues at the pace of the last seven years it will take four thousand years before every child in the south is placed in a schoolroom to which access is organized in conformity with federal constitutional requirements that creeping pace is determined now by those in the south who have seceded from obedience to court rulings and the plans of the centennial commission to date are aid and comfort to them as only one example is it mere coincidence that it was in montgomery alabama that the most elaborate and prolonged ritual in observance of the birth of the confederacy was staged in february and that martial law was needed to protect a meeting in a negro church in may a federal body appointed to consider how to mark the one hundredth anniversary of the war of emancipation should have been aware of the historical role of the cult of the confederacy as propagandacamouflage behind which was completed the defeat of reconstruction and the degradation of the negro in the late nineteenth century the object of the cult was to bring about the acceptance of a threepart myth that the south fought nobly for an ideal that deserved the blood shed for it that the old south laid waste by the war was a fine romantic noble place and that the romantic noblemen who lived there did more for their slaves than the latter could or ever would do for themselves the fable of the old south and the myth of the lost cause were dissected a few years ago by professor c vann woodward of johns hopkins in his origins of the new south he explored the economic links between the converted whigs of the postreconstruction new south and the northern industrial republicans of the gilded age who invested there in connection with that alliance one of the most significant inventions of the new south was the old southa new idea in the eighties and a legend of incalculable potentialities shortly after the war the louisville courierjournal said the bonny blue flag is the symbol of nothing to the present generation of southern men    the southern confederacy went down forever fifteen years ago its issues and ensigns went down with it a few years later however jefferson davis was resurrected from his political exile to help mend the fences of a corrupt local politician in georgia he was borne up and down his old dominions to a continuous ovation the lost cause was then retrieved from historys discard to become a way of life in  the united daughters of the confederacy was organized in the capital of the new south atlanta only then when the movement was taken into custody by southern womanhood did the cult of the lost cause assume a religious character monuments were planted in courthouse squares usually the figure of a soldier facing north gun in hand the success of southern apologists meant not merely that the confederate side of the war was hygenized and glamorized the cause of the north was correspondingly demeaned moreover it was consistent with the needs of the exploding postwar economy of the east that there should be distorted and suppressed the meaning of the most humanistic and progressive period of american political thought the period of abolitionism and transcendentalism of the underground railroad and brook farm was swept under the rug it is part of that development that when one thinks today of the word abolitionist one associates it with fanatic or zealot accordingly such figures as william lloyd garrison wendell phillips charles sumner and yes thaddeus stevens have been cruelly dealt with these men form a noble part of our national heritage and it is not a matter of sectional pride that raises the point the rebels may have manufactured the myth of the old south but it was the yankees who accepted it the new south wanted the moral significance of abolition to be forgotten but it was the new north that did the forgetting the guilty responsibility for the century of deferral of true emancipation of the negro is heavy enough to be shared through all america including those of us of immigrant stock who accepted from the nineties to the fifties the tainted gift of white supremacy as a compensation for our own secondclass citizenship when john jay chapman spoke at coatesville pennsylvania in  in memory of a particularly brutal lynching of a year before he traced its roots to the wickedness of all america and of three hundred yearsthe wickedness of the slave trade all of us are tinctured by it no special place no special persons are to blame the crime of the southern redeemers who overthrew the reconstruction governments was shared by the northern conservatives who had tired of the negro by  and left him to his terrible fate the civil war should be commemorated but not in a manner that drains it of all meaning in military dumb shows and not in a manner which emboldens those guilty today of offenses identified with the secession lincolns second inaugural address closed with an appeal for malice toward none and charity for all but it did establish what the conflict was about one eighth of the population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it  these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war  it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged there was courage and devotion and tragedy on both sides during the civil war it does not detract from the magnificent heroism of the men of the south nor does it deny the sacrifice of its women to insist that the cause that was lost was founded on an evil one does not have to deny the tragedy of blasted homes and lives to say that the old south depended on an iniquitous social system that could not be tolerated in america it does not serve america well in the world of  to ignore the evil and iniquity of slavery in marking the centennial of the conflict our country is still tom at home and dishonored abroad because of the victory snatched from the jaws of reconstruction by the side that had lost the war that victory was the establishment of the prerogative of the former slave states to impose segregation in place of chattel slavery as the basis of race relations james m dabbs the southerner who heads the southern regional the gar the union veterans organization that eisenhower had often saluted those who wore one uniform and fought under one flag fought for their country and were right while those who wore the other uniform and fought under the other banner fought against their country and were wrong no sentimentality and no commercial efforts to efface these radical differences should be encouraged by any true patriot a similar thought had occurred to the founding fathers of  they had provided in article iii of the constitution that treason against the united states shall consist  in levying war against them when the firing on fort sumter was reenacted in a setting of live oaks and magnolias who was there to remind the playactors in ever so small a voice that the original shot was after all treason 
all here and now
his voice was    soft and gentle and yet there seemed to be steel hidden away somewhere in it it was courteous and full of appeal and yet there was something grim and frightening in it every word used was full of meaning and seemed to carry a deadly earnestness thus nehru described the spectacular novel protest of gandhis satyagraha movement against the repressive rowlatt acts in india in  his tribute to gandhi is now an apt description of the american negros protest through various forms of nonviolent action against an oppressive culture dominated by whites until  satyagraha the use of soul force and truth force in nonviolent noncooperative protest against oppression was unknown in india in satyagraha gandhi combined concepts of peaceful civil disobedience from thoreau and tolstoi and added his own contribution by applying these  concepts successfully to political relationships gandhi developed his ideas and methods in south africa and then brought them to india he introduced a new kind of i warfare a warfare which renounced hostility against human beings but which used nonviolent weapons against injustice twentyeight years later due partly to the coercive power of the gandhian technique of nonviolent resistance british rule ended in india since satyagraha is the method now being used by american negroes against racial oppression we must understand this movement for what it is in the first place it is obvious that negroes in the movement refuse to retaliate in kind or to do violence to human life it is less obvious but equally true that they do not use verbal violence or yield to hatred they seek justice and rely heavily on a silent appeal to the conscience of the oppressor the power of this method when it is applied in a society which gives even lip service to christian faith should not be underestimated the negro is fighting and effectively he is deliberately breaking local laws and violating local customs which demean his dignity and deprive him of the rights and benefits guaranteed by a higher law he is doing so in the hope that such disobedience will eventually compel the white man to grant him justice he is courting unjust imprisonment  as a means of laying upon the conscience of the nation his legitimate claim to full citizenship he is reluctantly but voluntarily suffering assaults by white ruffians in the confidence that justice will be returned to him for his suffering his warfare is soft and gentle but there is steel hidden away somewhere in it it is courteous and full of appeal and yet  grim and frightening this is not a passive but an active protest which rejects violence but is nevertheless coercive which renounces hatred and hostility but is nevertheless aggressive and compelling the negro protest is militantly nonviolent satyagraha has come to america such warfare thus defined and limited is just regrettably necessary and potentially successful most americans find it grim and frightening obviously it is painful and terrifying to southern racists who have never met such opposition before and do not know how to cope with it what can be done to men and women who endure beatings welcome imprisonment and are willing to die if necessary for a just cause the negros nonviolent action is also frightening to the moderates who have been willing to champion the humble negroat least verballybut who are now confronted for the first time by the novel spectacle of a proud selfconfident negro who knows what is his and serves notice that he intends to take it the negros nonviolent protest if not frightening is certainly grim business for its leaders they know or should that there are two perils which always accompany the successes of such a movement first the nouveau proud having won for themselves a legitimate selfconfidence must resist the temptation to let pride deteriorate into vanity and haughtiness they must do so not to cajole the white man but to retain that ingredient of selfsurrender which is indispensable to the continuing success of a nonviolent crusade second there is always the danger that a nonviolent movement through exasperation over delayed successes will get out of hand and become a violent movement that a bloodless revolution will become a bloody one on three occasions between  and  gandhis followers inadequately disciplined in the techniques of satyagraha resorted to mob violence doing harm to human life and to their own cause on each occasion gandhi called off his nonviolent crusade over the objections of his closest associates and did personal penance through fasting for the violence of his people the same peril with even more disastrous consequences faces the peaceful rebellion of american negroes if the ranks of those who resist oppression in nonviolent action are infiltrated by negroes and whites who are not disciplined in peaceful resistance or if the negroes desert wise leadership and resort to the violence preached by the black muslims justice and freedom for the negro in america will suffer a profound reversal it is a grim and frightening business for the nation when the negro has to launch what is nothing less than a peaceful revolution in order to claim what the laws of the i country guarantee to all its citizens the shame and the weakness of the nation are exposed and its soli j darity is threatened the enemies of the united states do not need to fabricate scurrilous propaganda in order to discredit the intentions of the united states in its dealings with the colored peoples of the world they need only to report in the congo in laos in venezuela what has actually happened in alabama mississippi and louisiana the most devastating propaganda circulated against the united states from moscow and peking is written in the deeds done in the deep south and in the racial ghettos of northern cities the naive pompous assertion that it does not matter what the rest of the world thinks about the united states is refuted each day in the news from africa asia and latin america and most of all the negros nonviolent revolution should be a grim warning to white christian churches james t mccain south carolina field secretary for the congress of racial equality recently declared that the emancipation proclamation freed the  negro physically the supreme j court decision freed him men j segregated public schools unconstitutional only  per cent of the negro children attend desegregated schools in an area encompassing  southern and border states and the district of columbia four of these states defy the supreme court decision altogether and five make only a token compliance gradualism is a science in which southern legislators and southern courts are extraordinarily proficient therefore the negro through sitins and freedom rides leapfrogs local laws and prejudiced local courts on his way toward civil_rights which national laws have assured him the negro has waited  years for his proclaimed emancipation to become a reality he is no longer in a waiting mood he wants all that belongs to him and he wants it here and now a revolution is under way in this country beginning in the south it may spread wherever injustice reigns how long it will last and whether it will be peaceful depends on the dedication and discipline of negroes on the willingness of the white south to surrender repressive customs and nullify oppressive laws on the capacity of the american people to recognize in time how urgent it is that all americans be permitted to rise to the full dignity of liberty and equality 
the partys over at border state schools

sk the average coach at a nonnorthern major college or university and hell usually tell you quite bluntly give me some good negro ball players and ill give you a winning team conceited as it may sound there is a lot of truth in that statement if you base your judgment on the heavy recruiting that major schools all over the country are doing in the negro ranks these days truth however is a precise word discovered only after examining all the facts and more and more coaches are learning we regret to report that the mere presence of negroes on a major college team is not the only ingredient of a winning combination major colleges were once very cautious when they recruited a negro athlete they stuck with the super stars and because of that a host of great athletes became legends in their own lifetimes start a list of legendary negro athletes and you could go on and on duke slater jesse owens ralph metcalfe jackie robinson marion motley buddy young wilt chamberlain oscar robertson etc the list could grow at every thought these men proved to the world that the negro athlete could hold his own with anyone often theirs was a lonely and thankless fight but they made their point now almost every major college except those of the deep south aims its recruiting program at promising young negro athletes with hopes of that allimportant winning team but like dr frankenstein these colleges may have in the making a monster situation which can run out of control unless some serious thinking is doneand soon recruiting the superstar was no problem he was usually the only negro on the team and was treated more or less royally he was the negro star on a team of white players few gave it more thought than that but today the partys over for the superstar and the time has come for nonnorthem schools and northern schools too to realize that problems resulting from the presence of a large number of negroes on a team are cropping up and must be solved now generally speaking the problem reminds one of the old riddle wherein a man looks at  identical chickens and is told to pick six good ones and a half dozen of the other kind similarlv coaches y  are faced with the problem of choosing between one or many negro athletes it poses the question for him of how many players are too many and how few are not enough public opinion being what it is he has to be extra careful less he be branded a pioneer for having too many and prejudiced for having too few in many areas of the country the problem is small iowa for instance had nine negro starters at one time on its football team last season and was quite successful eastern schools have been dotted with negro talent for years and most of the top track schools can band together a crack allnegro relay unit these however are generally northern or western schools where little trouble is expected anyway the nonnorthem but not particularly southern school is the new proving ground and is where the greatest work must be done kansas a border state lying between the liberal north and the traditional south provided an excellent example of some of the problems that can develop it is a nonnorthem school in a state rich in the history of pioneering for civil_rights the first negro basketball player in the the big eight conference lavannes squires was a kansan and it produced what many people still claim was the biggest of the super basketball stars wilt chamberlain last season the jayhawks fielded a team with seven negroes on it it was a far cry from the days when wilt the stilt hit the scene wilt came to kansas like a meteor that glared brightly almost blinding the people of that farm state with his skill and then suddenly sputtering so quickly as to leave them breathless he was a superstar in the purest sense of the word and probably had more influence than any other player on the thinking of the people of the southwest about accepting negro athletes while the dipper was there the conference was stormy and exciting he was a huge sevenfoot negro who loomed as a tower of strength on any floor he appeared racially he was abused misused misunderstood loved and hated throughout his abbreviated career but he held his ground for three years and took whatever he had to until the lure of big money and professional ball lured him away from kansas in  the start of his senior year few big northern athletes had gone to nonnorthern major universities up to that time after chamberlain there would be many to follow up until then the big eight picked its negro stars from the near midwest and the south this all changed after chamberlain left and negroes on conference as well as other southwestern teams are becoming commonplace but ironically kansas the school that started it all wound up last season having the most trouble ku had seven negroes on its basketball team including wayne hightower a much sought after prep allamerican who as a junior was rated by many as the outstanding allaround player in the big eight a correll and ralph heyward two former prep allamericans from philadelphia were on the roster as was bill bridges an allbig eight center and workhorse of the team two sophomores nolen ellison and jim dumas gave kansas two local allstate standouts and butch ellison brother of nolen was one of kansas outstanding junior college players before enrolling at ku here were seven stars from such varied states as kansas new mexico and pennsylvania of the white players only two de ketchum and jerry gardner appeared capable of matching the talents of these negro athletes the nine of them gave kansas what most observers called the best talent in the league everything in fact seemed right for a great year the coaches thought so even the players agreed that kansas would be tough to beat but these rich hopes never materialized and the bubble began to burst even before the season started kansas lost the preseason christmas tournament after being a heavy favorite after that people began to have doubts and made no secret in expressing them they started asking embarrassingbut then timely questions were there too many negroes on the team was there dissension among white and negro players did the coach play favorites whats wrong with kansas at midseason when heyward was lost because of scholastic difficulties the very serious and academic question finally popped upwas kansas sacrificing its standards with these negro players to build a winning team as the teams fortunes grew worse the abuse heightened the school nickname soon changed from jayhawks to blackhawks the racial taunts heretofore unnoticed picked up with such intensity until it provided the spark needed to start the yearly brawl at the kansasmissouri game in columbia mo kumu fights have been going on long before either school had negroes but to a nationwide tv audience not familiar with the situation a racial fracas was what it looked like the only persons who could accurately answer those questions were coach dick harp and the players their views often differed harp considered one of the big eights warmest coaches took issue with those who criticized him we knew we had seven negro players but we didnt think it would cause any problem we tried to get the best ball players available but had no intentions of sacrificing the standards of the university to build a winning team people talked about dissension on our team but if there was i surely didnt see it our kids i think realized who should be playing and if there was any resentment it was no more than you  would normally have from any player who in his opinion thought he should be in the lineup more during the season in fact no one even approached me or questioned me on the subject though im sure there was some dissatisfaction for the players angle one would naturally turn to hightower the teams superstar a graduate of philadelphias overbrook high school the same school that produced chamberlain he was a handpicked replica of wilt and was expected to bring kansas the one thing the dipper had failed to do a national title there were many similiarities about the two men both came to kansas with big reputations to live up to both took command of any floor they were on and tried to be the center of attention both were crowd pleasers and high scorers both were aloof from the rest of the student body a great deal of the time both caught hell in every game home or away the similarity has to end there for unlike wilt hightower had a temper and proved moody on and off the court he developed from a mild freshman to the stormy character of his junior year and quit at the end of the  school year hightower never caught the fans favor as did chamberlain especially after he privately and publicly avowed his dislike of the state with him as leader kansas fans complained that they couldnt identify themselves with the team a rebel by nature hightower displayed what most people called a lack of humility on and off the court and this often caused him more grief they preferred bridges the new mexicoborn center who kept his mouth shut and hustled all game but as the superstar hightower best could speak of the problems faced for he knew them well perhaps better than the whole group combined none of us expected to see so many negroes on the team wayne stated and though we liked playing together it put a lot of pressure on us all the time we had to win because if we lost people wouldnt say kansas got beat they would say the negroes lost again right away they started looking for excuses and reasons for the losses other than that we simply got beat i personally didnt mind playing with a lot of negroes but it left us all open to much abuse especially the racial insults we traveled in the southwest where people had never seen so many negroes on a team we had trouble almost everywhere we played at missouri in that final game they spat on us and called us names so much that we had to fight i couldnt understand those kind of people to me they were like animals thus a sad fact evolved this nonnorthem area apparently objected to a negrodominated team representing them the people   would never admit it but perhaps the shock was too great for many of the people who migrated here from southern states cold cash facts indicate that this experiment cost kansas home attendance fell off  from the  season that year kansas drew an estimated  cage fans into allen fieldhouse in  with the blackhawks as the chief drawing card it drew only  in  games by comparison chamberlain as the lone super star had over   fans flock to see him play in  for a school with the second largest seating capacity in the nation  this dropoff was a bitter pill to swallow j the side effects were almost lethal for a state university white athletes freely passed around the  suggestion that kansas preps enroll at rival kstate because ku  i preferred northern negro talent  and that unless they were allamerican they would get no chance to play j when hightower quit it had a j negative effect on several promising negro prospects who declined scholarships figuring that if hightower couldnt make it the school j must be too tough now because of hightowers departure a poor freshman crop two dropouts and graduation kansas is at a point where it could finish in the conference cellar for the first time in its long history kansas learned much from its experience with chamberlain and the blackhawks for it saw firsti hand some of the problems a non northern school can run into especially if its schedule takes it into i a southernthinking area  it learned the meaning of the word trouble as the negro athlete has used it for years and how it goes further than the namecalling kansas learned the traditional meaning of trouble which saw its team split on road trips with negro players staying at private homes or nearby negro colleges they saw their negro players rebuffed at restaurants theaters stores and public transportation to combat this coaches joined northern schools in insisting that their players eat and live together even if it meant giving up the plush hotel for a college dormitory but more than anything else kansas coaches became acquainted with the pattern of negro life and learned of a kind of trouble which they couldnt stop but must have some control of in reflecting the kansas situation of last season perhaps this blowup was the thing needed to bring to light something every negro athlete should realize especially those planning to attend the nonnorthern major college or university if present recruiting trends continue the day of the negro superstar is over true there will be negro allamericans and stars in every sport but few can hope to attain the same status of the superstar of old  the first negro novelty is wearing off in most areas of the country and the sooner negroes realize this the better like northern areas theyre becoming just another good ball player and should expect to be treated as such chamberlain was a superstar by himself supreme on the floor with things pretty much the way he wanted it hightower was a superstar to the writers and the other coaches to the school and its fans he was just the best of a good group of negro players and that appears to be the fate of any one of several negroes on a team allamerican rating or not for the northernborn negro today who plays at a nonnorthem school he must prepare himself for what is surely to come the namecalling and other racial taunts often done on purpose with the full knowledge that the negro player will explode will continue as long as people find there is a need for them harold hunter head coach of the allnegro tennessee state university which ended the  season as the nations no  ranked small college team upi poll is a realist along these lines his schedule last season included only four allnegro schools hunter advocated stronger discipline for negro players on white teams as a possible solution you take a boy from a big city where he has been a star and right away he wants to have his own way in stead of doing what he is told coaches nowadays have a way of taking too much off the city boy instead of treating him like any other player the thing that impressed me about oscar robertson at cincinnati was that despite the fact that they gave him almost everything we wanted he still remained a team ball player and followed his coachs advice thats what made him a great college player kansas coach harp along these same lines was firm in what he believed should be the negro athletes goal at kansas we pride ourselves on building leadership and this i think should be the goal of every negro athlete going to college everyone i feel recognizes the ability of our negro athletes our purpose as a university is not to build better athletes but better young men who will lead our country and in their particular case their people a boy should come to college to develop leadership and not just to play basketball or some other sport if he doesnt i think hes missing the entire purpose of his education to the young negro athlete we can only offer this advice pick your schools northern or otherwise with care and with the realization that all that glitters is not gold nonnorthern schools for the negro today are for the most part excellent kansas university the model of most of this article is an excellent nonnorthern school with a fine reputation all nonnorthern schools however have some problems which in the coming years will cease to exist but for now must be at least realized by the prospective athlete one should always remember that at most nonnorthern schools some negro has already paved the way and a close check will probably reveal little ill effects

much her graygreen eyes stared steadfastly back at her as she combed out her dark cloud of hair and arranged it decorously behind her shellpink ears and secured the tiny pearl earrings her dress a pale blue cotton with a full skirt and a puritan collar lay on the bed waiting she slipped it on over her neat head carefully and buttoned the little white buttons that marched sturdily up the bodice to look as neat and gentle as possible to meet his parents and his sisters and his brothers she was a birchslim tall girl and the chocolate colored hair belled gloriously about her tender throat he was even taller than she she could wear her new patent heels fright made her hands wet and beaded her upper lip shall they like me she wondered for the millionth time please let them want me he and she sat near each other in psychology ii and a mutual college friend had introduced them from then on they had needed no one listened to no one i only need you he had told her do you want me enough she had pushed back her dark hair and looked up into his clear dark eyes her own eyes wide with the emotion she felt yes she had said to him simply i need you very much it wont be easy he had said but she had merely touched his mouth with her fingers letting her steady eyes say it all for her it was like that with them they regarded one another with tenderness she sat now like a little girl primly careful of her dress on the mourners bench that squatted on the front porch of her college boarding house and waited for him to come as he handed her into the battered waxed and polished little coupe she noted with elation how handsome he looked in his gray flannel suit he had his hair clipped painfully short and he wore a bluish colored necktie and he was nervous she could tell for his manner was taut and he spoke her small name brusquely but he had smiled at her and her heart began to glow the sunday afternoon streets had that lonely subdued sunday look they passed a few humans watering lawns or aimlessly walking she watched the empty streets with interest wondering where all the people went on the long sunday afternoons she could not look at him they were letting the world in today and at this time when they should  	have been so close seeking solace and strength each from the other she could not even look at him her brother had told her bluntly for you it is a combination of new freedom and suddenly being exposed to all these liberal college groups youll get your balance back most of us do go ahead get it out of your system but dont jump to conclusions too fast and dont you let yourself do anything you cant file away and forget he had been very amused and understanding and tolerant about it after all he had added for emphasis i went through it myself youll actually learn from it if you keep your values intact he had made her quite angry as juliet must have felt when her family disparaged her romeo she had lifted her chin and felt ready to fight hurricanes she had wanted to fly into the worlds prosy face and smack it with her little fist    the streets began to change there were stores and cafes and taverns the traffic was heavier he turned down a side street the houses were all tall and ancient gingerbread decorated the dingy gables there were people sitting in the fading sunlight and the shrill screams of playing children he led her up a neat walk up many wooden steps to stand before a wide old door with stained glass windows he opened it and she passed through she smelled food hot heavy food cooking hard there were people here also in this oldfash ioned parlor their dark wary wise eyes chilled her as she went at his side from one to the other smiling unsure and diffident he put her into a big chair and the scene blurred into kaleidoscopic confusion a sister which one sat beside her talking about college his mother brought her a slice of delicious chocolate cake and a cup of steamy lemony tea the mothers eyes were as cold as bits of unburned anthracite though her mouth was sweetly parted in a smile the brothers devoured her with quick glances and shoved each other a little for her benefit j he came to sit alongside her after a bit but his nearness did not help she thought of her mothers cool house of quiet uncluttered rooms of warmth of belonging acceptance of smiling eyes of back grounds and childhoods she remembered the loving arguments that had bored her so terribly but it was a giant step and suppose she was too immature and yet she was in love with him she was wasnt she they did not stay long he pleaded a party that they were to attend and she promised to come back soon and when they stood outside at last she was amazed to see that it was night in the battered waxed and polished coupe she put a hand gently so gently over his clenched fist that clasped the steering wheel and when she looked at him she had her answer we dont have the courage she thought sadly it takes a special kind of courage and the compassionate way that he suddenly took her white hand into his brown one told her all that she needed to know 
bert williams the modern pagliaccio
by walter monfried
t he contribution of negroes to american theater and music has been enormous the number of their gifted actors singers dancers bandsmen and entertainers runs into the hundreds until recently however they have not been prominent in the field of comedy but now a group of bright younger men headed by dick gregory of st louis is showing marked ability in that field too gregory a monologist of clever wit and shrewd observation is being called the finest negro comedian since bert williams to couple the name of gregory with that of bert williams is the highest of compliments williams nearly  years after his death is ranked among the finest of comedians of any color the funniest man i ever saw the late w c fields said of williams and he added the saddest man i ever knew edward b marks a long time song publisher and sage of show business asserted that no comedian ever surpassed bert in facial expression and pantomime he equaled the greatest of clowns chaplin at his best could hold an audience no better in his slow mournful delivery of a song bert was a raconteur without parallel each song was a mood or an anecdote and you never missed a nuance of feeling master of the single williams tall and handsome was threesixteenths negro and his skin was so light in color that he blackened it for the stage a man of wide reading and cultivated voice he had to speak in the traditional southern drawl expected of a negro entertainer as douglas gilbert the historian of vaudeville points out the printed description hardly provides a faint idea of the williams mastery as a singlethe marvelous face work the expressions of wonder and disdain the vocal drollery the unexpected rises and falls of inflection where im living now is a nice place but you have to go along a road between two graveyards to get to it one of his favorite monologs went one night last week i was coming home kind of late and i got about halfway home when i happened to look over my shoulder and saw a ghost following me i started to run i run till i was most ready to drop and then i looked around but i didnt see no ghost so i sat down on the curbstone to rest then out of the corner of my eye i could see something white and when i turned square around there was that ghost sitting along side of me the ghost says that was a fine run we had it was the best running i ever saw and i says yes and as soon as i get my breath youre going to see some more  poker hand classic williams was equally admired for the way he could put over songs including youve got the right church but the wrong pew my castle on the nile not for me the jonah man all goin out and nothin cornin in  why dont you get a lady of your own and above all the humorouspathetic nobody delivered deliberately with eloquent pauses i aint never done nothing to nobody iaint never got nothin from nobodyno time anduntil i get somethin from somebody sometime i dontintend to do nothin for nobodyno time his fans never wearied of his silent miming of a poker game alone amid a darkened stage he stood in a spotlight glare only his head shoulders and hands visible holding the cards close to his face he looked eagerly at the draw studied the hand intently placed his bet eagerly looked ever so suspiciously at his fellow sportsmen exulted at the calland relapsed into the losers profound disgust it was rated a classic of vaudevilles happiest era among williams closest friends were ring lardner the gloomy humorist and ashton stevens the chicago stage reviewer lardner and williams were by nature prodigiously untalkative when the former visited the others dressing room they would sit by the hour making a deaf mute seem garrulous by contrast stevens could incite the entertainer to a few more words in his last interview with williams he wrote he was offered a drink this during prohibition and the talk got around to drinking spots the saloon was the only club in which a man of my color could  meet a man of your color brother stevens williams related and i like my friends like to be with them id pop my head in a saloon door and not seeing anybody i knew id say in my best london accent sorry i thought mr stevens was here i always said i was waiting for somebody even when i was only waiting for anybodyanybody whod breeze in and say hello bert what you doing here funny what a manll do for human companionship the interviewer asked williams about his forthcoming role im a hotel porter an awful liar but a character was the answer i sing one number with an outcast dog a lady has given me  to take the dog out and feed him her husband has given me  to take the dog out and drown him theres some problem in that songim working it out slow way i do everything i ought to be able to understand how that old black porter feels yes and he added in his mellow melancholy bass and  ought to be able to understand how the dog feels too born in west indies egbert austin bert williams was born on the british west indies island of antigua in  his fathers father was a native of denmark the danish consul in antigua and the owner of a plantation on which bert grew up his mother was threefourths spanish and onefourth negro his father in ill health moved with his family to riverside calif williams went to school there and wanted to attend stanford university but lacked funds he read good books all his life however schopenhauer mark twain goethe and many others in boyhood williams showed himself a natural at song and mimicry he could imitate the movements and speech of anyone instead of going to the university he picked up an old banjo and became a minstrel in west coast theaters and honkytonks he teamed up with another talented negro entertainer george walker and the actwhich they worked upranked among the finest in vaudevilles heyday they branched out into legitimate with a musical revue called in dahomey which had a huge success in america and was taken to england where it ran for a year king edward vii was a williams fan and in  decreed a command performancethe highest honor any foreign actor could attain in england the king liked to chat with the american off stage later williams shows in which many negroes participated were abyssinia and in bandana land in their matchless dialogs williams played the slow witted drawling fall guy to walkers sophisticated sharpie a typical routine walker i could do this alone but im letting you in on it because youre a friend of mine first of all go into the bank and fill this satchel with money williams whose money walker that aint the point we dont know who put the money there we dont know how they got it and they wont know how we got it all you have to do is fill the satchel williams and what do i do with this satchel walker just bring it to me at a place where i tell you williams when they come to count the cash in the bank and find it short what then walker by that time well be far far awaywhere the birds are singing sweetly and the flowers are in bloom williams after long sober reflection  and if they catch us theyll put us so far far away we never will hear no birds singin singin and everybody knows you cant smell no flowers through a stone wall the handsome sociable walker who couldnt resist high life and swift women was mortally stricken with paresis around  and williams had to go on alone florenz ziegfeld creator of the perennial follies revues admitted that he had no taste for comedy but he recognized the appeal of williams and starred him in several of his shows from  on at first other follies performers threatened to strike if they had to appear with him and williams part of the show was cut to his old time vaudeville single routine but the friendliness and artistry of the newcomer won them over and he was accepted as a full fledged colleagueand by audiences too one evening as williams was going to his dressing room he overheard one actor say to another you have to say this for bert williamshe knows his place thats right williams interrupted genially its that room with the star on the door for nearly a decade williams adorned the follies with vaudeville excursions during off seasons and then went into the famous new york winter garden revues the shubert brothers broadways most powerful showmen created a musical comedy under the bamboo tree especially for williams talents in the early she was the only colored member on tour with it he became ill of pneumonia and returned to his new york home where he died at  of the many theater critics who exalted williams heywood broun was especially perceptive he conceded that eddie cantor and a jolson supplied excitement vitality and efficiency but the old bert williams gave you more quiet and consolation he found prosperity and success in the theater but his high talents were largely wasted every round of laughter bound him more securely to his estate as merrymaker booker t washington the famous negro educator and reformer did not share this view bert williams has done more for the race than i have he declared he has smiled his way into peoples hearts i have been obliged to fight my way  
management cracks
industry to meet its  ever growing needs for management profession and technical personnel has begun to turn to a previously almost untapped source the  plus young negroes who are now graduating each year from college and professional schools corporate recruiters long familiar sights on the campuses of the nations universities and colleges now are becoming frequent visitors to the allnegro institutions the best known of these howard university in washington d c is regularly visited by representatives of some  leading companies and most of the some negro colleges and universities now are on corporate calling lists major companies already carrying out negro campus recruiting include bell telephone labs boeing columbia broadcasting system general electric ibm north american aviation union carbide corp and western electric typical of companies which have opened higher level employment to negroes is the burroughs corp where according to industrial relations vice president frank g armstrong negroes now serve as sales and service men computer statisticians engineering draftsmen electrical and mechanical engineering designers field site technicians electronic technicians mathematicians and technical editors armstrong testifying at a detroit hearing of the us commission on civil_rights declared that i am happy and not a little proud to say that our corporate policy of employment and promotion on a nondiscriminatory merit basis has been highly successful but he added that there had been a noticeable lack of negro applicants trained to take up skilled technical and professional positions this lack however is being rapidly overcome negro college enrollment multiplied almost eight times between  and  while all enrollment increased only a little more than three times and doubled from  to  while all enrollment increased only  a company which fails to hire negroes for jobs for which they are qualified is shortchanging itself according to joseph j morrow vice president personnel relations of pitneybowes inc which employs negroes in high level engineering administrative and sales he says negroes consider themselves permanently on trial no matter how long they are with a company the end result is often distinctly superior in both quality and quantity from a purely selfish standpoint an employer who might be reluctant to hire negroes can assure himself that they are good workers a good investment we wouldnt trade our negro employes for anything paralleling  and backstopping the opening up of higher level negro employment by business and industry itself is the federal governments campaign spearheaded by the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities to end all discrimination in industry the committee headed by vice president lyndon johnson and labor secretary arthur goldberg is empowered to publicize names of companies holding government contracts and labor unions which fail to eliminate discriminatory practices and to initiate legal action to terminate contracts and bar new ones with companies refusing to end such practices it expects however to achieve its goals by voluntary agreement the committee recently worked out an agreement with lockheed aircraft corp which outlaws all forms of discrimination and segregation throughout the companys nine divisions and provides for active work in the fields of recruitment employment and upgrading of negroes the agreement was hailed by president kennedy as a milestone in the history of civil_rights the presidents brother attorney general robert kennedy recently asserted that election of a negro to the us presidency could come within the next  years selection of a negro as board chairman or president of a major corporation might come even sooner spearheading the movement to open the higher levels of employment to qualified negroes is the national urban league whose commerce and industry council has just held a manpower utilization conference in new york attended by representatives of  corporations and  universities and colleges general and negro albert f waters vice president of general foods corp who presided at the conference stated that business and industry not only for their own sake but for that of the nation as a whole must institute a program parallel to that being carried on by the federal government to attract qualified young negroes to responsible positions he said our meeting is against a severe backdrop which silhouettes its importance internationally the us is in the midst of a cold war race and we cannot afford to waste any of our human resources describing the conference as the first time in us history that so large a group of corporation representatives and education representatives have convened to consider recruitment of collegetrained negroes on a national basis he added while a number of important companies have extended employment in business relating to training and capacities of negro graduates the vast majority of companies have ignored this source of capable manpower news front to find out just what progress negroes actually have made in attaining executive and professional jobs asked  of the nations leading corporations their policy on hiring negroes for such jobs and the number they themselves employed in such capacities most companies because of provisions of the new york state and other antidiscrimination laws were reluctant to place themselves on record but the survey did reveal that the proportion of negroes holding such positions is much higher than generally believed and is mounting the survey also made clear however that almost all such jobs fall into the technical professional and staff categories and that few negroes as yet hold corporate positions with direct line responsibility also indicative is the fact that while in  only  of all employed negroes held professional technical and similar jobs and only  office and clerical jobs in  the figures had risen to

how to guard against heart attacks
every year in the united states the number of people who have heart attacks increases of the hundreds of thousands who suffer an attack more than  percent die in  the last year for which national health education committee figures are available a total of  persons died from heart attacks and other heart diseases men are the principal victims of heart attacks and other cardiovas cularrenal diseases it is estimated that as many as  percent of all fatal heart attacks are suffered by men in the age group between  and  at least twice as many men as women have heart attacks this means that women are likely to have more heart attacks the older they get before menopause the rate of heart disease among women is relatively low according to medical research the female hormone estrogen provides builtin protection for younger women after menopause when the female  hormone subsides women become nearly as susceptible to coronary disorders as men heart attacks arteriosclerosis take a greater toll of human life than any other disease it is a killer against which medical science is mustering formidable opposition however to help reduce the high and spiraling heart attack death rate the public must understand heart disease why so many people suffer from it and what can be done about it to begin with it is necessary to know what a heart attack is and to understand what happens it is necessary to know something of the nature and operation of the heart a heart attack is basically hardening of the arteries around the heart the medical term for this condition is arteriosclerosis of the coronary vessels when fatlike substances in the blood accumulate in the walls of the arteries they tend to clog the arteries and block the flow of blood to the heart muscle this causes what is known as a heart attack the fatty substances in the blood comes from the food consumed and they have the dubious distinction of being the only insoluble elements taken into the body this fat consists of many things cholesterol or fatty alcohol is one of the principal substances ordinary butterfat is another while there are other kinds of heart disease arteriosclerotic heart disease is by far the most dangerous and the most serious form of arteriosclerosis is technically known as atherosclerosis or calcification of the arteries resulting in blood clots hypersensitive heart disease is another frequent heart ailment it is caused by high blood pressure which puts an extra burden on the hearts pumping mechanism eventually this extra pressure impairs the hearts ability to function normally still another frequent heart ailment is rheumatic heart disease this form of heart disease occurs most often to persons with a history of rheumatic fever in childhood rheumatic heart disease affects the heart valves primarily but also involves the joints the term growing pains refers to the aches of rheumatic heart disease angina pectoris is a somewhat less serious heart trouble it is chest pain caused by a lack of sufficient blood supply to part of the heart muscle and it is usually temporary rest is the best remedy for it while angina pectoris is not the same as a heart attack they have in common the narrowing of the arteries the difference is that the artery does not completely close with angina pectoris while medical science knows of no certain means of avoiding heart attacks there are three general rules which doctors say will reduce the likelihood of heart disease these are  constant and moderate exercise to keep the muscles toned and the blood fat circulating  avoiding excessive physical and emotional strain which might make extra demands on the hearts pumping system and  guarding against excess weight and too much fat content in the diet taking the first rule exercise it is important to explode some of the myths about it and heart attacks when former president eisenhower suffered an attack in  many people thought that his regular excursions to the golf course may have had something to do with his illness but dr irvine h page president of the american heart association brushed this aside he said that if anything a round or two of golf made one less susceptible to heart attacks coronary heart attacks as far as i know dont seem to be any more common on the golf course or the tennis courts than they are when you sit in your office or are home in bed he said dr paul dudley white eminent heart specialist and president eisenhowers physician at the time issued a statement saying that the presidents heart attack had nothing to do with playing golf on the other hand doctors do not advise undertaking exercise of a strenuous or competitive nature if unaccustomed to it this can both overstimulate the heart muscle and bring on fatigue neither of which is calculated to discourage heart attacks  as to the high content of fats in the average american diet many scientists believe this largely accounts for the comparatively greater rate of heart disease among americans a study by dr ansel keys director of minnesotas laboratory of physiological hygiene indicated that the american diet was the fattest containing some  percent or more of calories from fats compared to this great britain had only about  percent and spain and italy a relatively safe  to  percent heart ailments are not major health hazards in spain and italy figures from the department of agriculture support the belief that the american heart disease ratio has risen in exact proportion to the fat content of the national diet back in  when heart disease was a less critical health problem only about  percent of the calories in the nations diet came from fats to cut the high heart disease rate among americans dr keys recommends that the proportion of calories from fats be reduced to between  and  percent this can be done he says without sacrificing basic nutritional needs however the nature of such a diet should be decided by a qualified physician or nutritionist unfortunately there are no surefire signs to warn of an impending heart attack the electrocardiogram for example which measures the electric impulses that  
an african student looks at america
by babs fafunwa
this country to study p i have met over fifty african students during my vacations in exchanging views with them i found that most of our impressions after arriving on the american soil are almost identical everything about him the student finds out mobbed by a group of inquiring reporters who ask what is your name where do you come from what is your impression about america how many wives has your father are you married is it true that you buy women in africa are you a prince is your father a king or a gold miner the shooting of flash bulbs adds to the confusion this barrage is an indication of what the student is to experience as he moves from one part of the united states to another one of my most exciting experiences happened when i arrived in new york city on that day it had one of its greatest snowfalls and whats more i had never seen snow in my life that day my heavy overcoat was no solution to my dilemma as i stepped out of the airplane i was baptized with the unusually biting cold i was shaken to the bones and all my limbs were trembling the woman in me subdued the man and my eyes were shedding tears like an arabian gum tree that night i slept in my overcoat suit and all the temperature was  f and the lowest temperature i had ever seen in nigeria is  till i landed in new york i had never met an american negro my impression was that since the negro has been living there for the past three hundred years or more he ought to have intermarried with the whites so that his color should be at least lighter than my own by the way i am ebony black and id like to be twice as dark but when i landed i saw a negro darker than myself i  thought he was an african who came a little earlier than i did i rushed to him with all the happiness and the joy finding a kinsman in this great metropolis i said hello dear when did you come he looked at me with cold surprise i later found that he must have been here three hundred years for his speech is as entirely strange to me as mine to him the student who hails from the british sphere of influence in africa finds on getting here that americas ideas of democracy are in conflict in a way to those of britains the average englishman admits that a lord jim is his better he does not resent his betters nor put himself on an equal basis with them nor does he wish to do so the american on the other hand rejects all ideas of class everybody is hey or say mister the student finds that democracy works fairly well in the north and otherwise in the south he finds in the north that competition is tough but in the south segregation and discrimination i stare him in the face i remember one day when the african students at bethunecook man college in florida were on their way back to school after giving an african program at a church we stopped at a filling station for some refreshments a policeman entered and said where are you niggers from  this particular aspect of our social life has been wilfully misrepresented and we hope our american friends will understand we love our women as passionately as the americans and we are not in the habit of illtreating them or regarding them as chattels the first thing an african student is told is that he should get americanized socialize with the girls forego the english wide trousers for the american narrow pants his little coat for the long heavy coat he finds that table manners in america vary considerably from what he had been used to at home he used fork knife spoon etc while the americans use the fork for everything on the table except soup he therefore has to unlearn what he had learned previously and get adjusted to the american way of life but the pity is that he has to unlearn what he is learning now in order to fit into his own pattern on his return home british way to american way back to british way again while at the same time he has to take care of his culture the african way 
phone
it was a gamble famed rev martin l king jr heralded as the man who controlled the minority vote because of his dixie crusading was lodged in a georgia prison and heads of major organizations were demanding that the presidential candidates intervene if they decided to act they could lose the support of whites in key dixie states both presidential candidates last fall studied the situation assessed the gains and the losses vice president nixon refused to take a position the then sen john f kennedy gingerly called the pregnant wife of the civil_rights hero and expressed his interest in their plight this telephone call late last october some political prognosticators argue decided the close  presidential election the reasoning is that the slim margin of victory was due to the heavy vote of negroes in strategic northern and southern states up to that time the usually democratic negro voting mass was complacent unmoved by campaign oratory and lacking the spark even to go in numbers to the polls for want of a dramatic and far sweeping attraction for the negro voter the kennedyking phone relay looms as the single headlined incident of the campaign previously there was little difference between the parties as negroes appraised the records of the candidates and the promises on the matter of the negro in the cabinet issue both party standard bearers neatly dodged the point with grandiose statements that qualifications not race should apply to selection of persons to key posts both parties developed after considerable negotiation strong civil_rights planks at the national convention both parties boasted candidates sensitive to civil_rights and to some degree talkative on the specifics but like the politicians they are they refrained from unduly annoying the white voters below the masondixon line on the m l king episode there was the striking comparison despite his proven ability to draw crowds rev king scrupulously refused to become attached to either party or give out statements backing either candidate  both parties however wooed him but the overtures became a nightmare when rev king got in trouble revered by negroes for his civil_rights record vice president nixon for the first time in the campaign revealed a shocking indifference refusing to make a statement or in any way become a participant in the rev king case the vice president even ignored the counsel of cabinet members and his three negro advisors white houser e frederic morrow gop minorities chief val washington and exbaseball star jackie robinson also it was brought out and widely publicized that nixon abandoned speaking engagements in negro sections of northern cities and quietly played down civil_rights as a campaign theme it was a grim revelation to many negroes that the government official who traveled to africa and was photographed shaking the hands of tribal villagers and holding black babies turned down the pleas to help one of their leadersfor political advantage aides later said the vice president hoped to carry some southern states and such an intervention thus would have damaged his election plan as could be expected there was a shift in sentimentaided perhaps by the showering of millions of leaflets in negro sections calling attention to the democratic candidates bold action there was a reevaluation of the candidate whose religion still was his main stumbling block in penetrating the highlyprotestant vote bloc there was an overall appraisal of the two candidates on sincerity and devotion to the cause of civil_rights a matter which previously had been taken for granted even the democrats focused the spotlight on topics of employment health and housing and reporters followed through with articles saying that for the first time negro voters were derailing civil_rights as a key item of consideration the first impact of the kennedy intervention in the king case came in philadelphia where thousands of negroes lined the streets and crowded a housing area to hear the young senator it was the first sign of acceptance by negroes in the campaign but kennedy had some difficulties the mikes broke down later in the week west coast negroes jammed an auditorium to hear kennedy and aides knew then that they had finally struck gold how a telephone call could trigger a national reaction not of jubilance or adulation but more of resentment at being misled confounded top democratic party workers but surprised leaders of the hardworking civil_rights section said one democrat this was like getting a homer in the ninth inning with the score tied few incidents in the campaign received such emphasis few statements or episodes were as widely publicized yet the phone call was no sudden act or a performance done in the heat of crusading almost a score of democratic leaders both negro and white memoed the jfk brass suggesting such a move while others buttonholed every ranking party spokesman behindthescenes there was a maddening flurry of activity which built into a storm and even the presidential candidate couldnt ignore it unknown to many rev king first started the chain of events a week before the historic call king wired kennedy urging a probe of the shooting of harry blake a field secretary for his southern christian leadership conference who was shot a few days earlier while leaving a shreveport la meeting kennedy assigned race relations aide frank reeves to investigate the case reeves then made arrangements to meet king at the airport when reeves arrived at the atlanta airport there was no rev king on the welcoming committee to his surprise reeves learned that king was lodged in jail having been arrested for participating with some youngsters in a sitin at a department store king was detained because of a violation of probation stemming from a traffic case rushing to the jail reeves talked with king and promptly dispatched word of the situation to kennedy advising several channels of action at the same time there were other jfk aides who quickly saw the political advantage of interventionif such a move came before the gop candidate spoke out among those who piloted the project were georgia organizer robert troutman civil_rights staffers harris wofford marjorie lawson louis martin and john seigenthaler a former tennessee newspaperman and aide to robert kennedy wofford got in touch with sargent shriver jfks brotherinlaw reeves spread the word from the candidate to members of his brain trust while most of the others streamed memos to brother robert kennedy with such momentum started it is difficult to ascertain the route of eventual action but one factor is clear the idea was born of no single individual because no one was influential enough to convince kennedy to take such a step as it was his brother robert appeared more daring even calling the atlanta mayor and a judge to air his views and urge consideration however when the presidential candidate called mrs king on wednesday october th the phone call blazed across the negro sections of the nation with as much impact as a mississippi lynching yet jfk made no promises or hinted even of subsequent relief in a later press statement mrs king said it certainly made me  feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt senator kennedy said he was very much concerned about both of us he said this must be hard on me he wanted me to know that he was thinking about us and he would do all he could to help us i told him i appreciated it and hoped he would help i had the feeling that if he was that much concerned he would do what he could so that mr king would be let out of jail she concluded with this bombshell i have heard nothing from the vice president or any one on his staff mr nixon has been very quiet if the wifes statement was not designed for political warfare the words of rev kings father were a prominent atlanta minister the senior rev king who described himself as a lifelong republican was quoted as saying i will carry a basket of votes to kennedy his optimism wasnt fulfilled completely despite his and his sons popularity nixon swept every negro precinct in atlanta with a handsome margin yet gop leader william j shaw conceded that the indifference on the part of the partys high command hurt the gop cause among negroes the same opinion was shared by negro gop leaders in other cities for weeks they quietly reaped a harvest of support by spreading the word that the democrats kept vice presidential nominee lyndon johnson a texan and a conservative in civil_rights out of the big northern cities it was no secret that johnson had little appeal for negroes and once reeves had to advise him to keep his wife from talking too much about her good friend her negro maid but even with this campaign asset the gopers realized that the high command had written off the negro vote for the first time there were no leaflets no newspaper ads in weekly papers no crosscountry campaigning compared to other years in other words said a gop topflighter the king case stuck us in the achilles heel it hurt nixon more than it helped kennedy while political experts attribute such importance to the phone call it is a favorable sign of progress in politics the negro vote certainly has come of age but such a conclusion understandably angers the professional democrats who contend the incident has been stretched out of context said one vip if were so childlike that a phone call can change our minds then publicizing this incident is one way to expand the stereotype that negroes arent intelligent voters theyre emotional mambypambies the controversy probably will rage for years but many americans still will remember the  election as one won by a man who gambled on a telephone call

the new black
by arna bontemps
n literature as in life no doubt dominant traits may be expected to reappear in alternate generations just as children may favor their grandparents more than their parents in ways at least young writers sometimes seem to reach back past their immediate predecessors for examples and blood ties with earlier kin thus the newest crop of negro writers in the united states show more traits in common with the writers of the harlem renaissance than with the famous wpa group who were their literary parents so to speak despite the ringing successes of richard wright frank yerby and willard motley bellweathers of the little flock nourished by wpa writers projects and such gifted colleagues of theirs as roi ottley margaret walker and gwendolyn brooks one searches in vain among the newest negro writers today for any who could qualify as their artistic progeny or even as their disciples well almost in vain lorraine hansberry the exciting author of raisin in the sun is in some very fundamental literary ways related to the sturdy author of native son black boy and uncle toms children even the hansberrywright link however which is by no means limited to the way in which they have drawn upon their common chicago background for subject matter is marked by notable differences miss hansberrys star came up unheralded nothing from her typewriter had been published or produced prior to raisin in the sun the critical and popular approval which followed this event made her famous and the rejoicing this occasioned can only be compared to the kudos which followed richard wrights sunburst a little more than a decade earlier but her recognition was based on a play native son was a novel black boy an autobiography uncle toms children a collection of stories and the two authors though they had both spent crucial years of their lives in the chicago jungle if thats the word for the south side of those days were separated by more than just a span of time in their development richard wrights young manhood in chicago was poverty ridden lorraine hansberrys family was welltodo by south side standards her father was in the real estate business he could in a manner of speaking have owned or managed the rental property in which bigger thomas killed the rat with the frying pan how his perceptive daughter came to see the human turmoil in those substandard quarters through eyes of sympathy and deep understanding has not been told miss hansberrys subsequent writing has consisted mainly of articles in periodicals it has not tended toward autobiography a lesser writer one imagines particularly a lesser negro writer in the united states might have been in a hurry given her talents and background to give the world a picture of debutants balls and gracious living to compensate for the ugliness richard wright had forced before the eyes of millions of readers to the embarrassment of our favored few she also avoided the equally unwise assumption that more of the same material that wright had presented would prove to be equally arresting when presented by her equally instructive but it doesnt work that way without the addition of new elements and the new hansberry ingredient was technique in the theatre a medium that demands a maximum of knowhow usually attained only after long and painful apprenticeship years of heartbreaking trial and error she showed up at first bow with complete control of her tools and her craft this was little short of startling selfeducated richard wright had been a toiling sometimes almost awkward manipulator of the devices of composition he had won over this disadvantage by sheer power in lorraine hansberrys case this particular shoe seemed to be on the other foot which of course is as it should be one looks for an increase of technical skills in a second or third generation of writers if any loss in originality or other qualities occurs one expects it to be balanced by greater familiarity with the mechanics thanks to the examples and experiments of the forerunners if this is not a generalization that can be applied to all of the newest crop of negro writers it should be allowances can no longer be made for technical weakness but more striking parallels or kinships as i have ventured appear when the work of the newest negro writers is put beside the product of the ardent young people who came to harlem in the early twenties and created the upsurge of creativity known as the harlem renaissance this was the group that drew from charles s johnson the cautious and careful sociologist the rare exclamation that a brief ten years have developed more confident selfexpression more widespread efforts in the direction of art by negroes in the u s than the long dreary two centuries before in the constellation to which johnson referred jean toomer was the first star his place and influence among the new negroes of the harlem group were like those of ralph ellison today  when published by such little magazines as dial broom little review and doubledealer toomers stories and sketches poems and plays delighted the avant garde symbolism with varying levels of psychological and philosophical meaning fascinated him yet his heart belonged to the folk negro charles s johnson thought at first he detected a certain remote link between toomers compositions and the writing of paul laurence dunbar where dunbar gave to the unnamed negro peasant a reassuring touch of humanity toomer gave to the peasant a passionate charm he observed his conclusion was however that toomer was more than an artist he was an experimentalist obviously much of this comment could as well be applied to the talented author of invisible man as to the handsome young wanderer whose cane was a literary sensation in  but who soon after turned his back on greatness ellison has not turned his back but he is a slow and painstaking worker invisible man was many years in the writing like cane however it was promptly recognized as a landmark  drawing heavily on folk sources reflecting its authors preoccupation with technique and the roots of artistic expression invisible mans critical reception amounted to acclaim it was accepted as a major work a consensus roughly equivalent to that which greeted cane thirty years earlier while one is clearly a novel the other hard to classify by form side by side the two books make a fascinating study a conversation between the two extremely articulate authors should it ever occur would be worth going many miles to overhear invisible man was a bestseller in the year in which it was published it was given the national book award in  marking a first in recognition of this type for a negro writer in the united states while it did not reach so wide an audience as richard wright had reached in the forties the reading public was much better prepared for it than it had been for cane only a few hundred copies of which were sold if neither ellison nor toomer became rich as a direct result of these important and significant books both immediately found themselves in demand in circles where the meaning of things are explored both awakened to find that their wellchosen words had suddenly become gospel to a goodly company of inquirers and both entered into secondary careers as occasional essayists discussants and instructors both ellison and toomer reached literature after an initial interest in music both have shown a probing interest in the common sources of creative expression even in their personal lives certain parallels may be detected but there are also significant differences and these may account for the crucial decision each eventually made ellison to write invisible man toomer to become invisible an authors looks have little if anything to do with his writing but some people who have known them both have not failed to observe that james baldwin is the spitnimage of wallace thurman when baldwin speaks and especially when he laughs the resemblance becomes so striking it almost makes one wonder about incarnation thurmans early death in the fading days of the harlem renaissance was one of two quick tragedies by which some of the participants have dated the passing of that period in the last five years of his life however thurman saw experienced and wrote a great deal he was no exception indeed he was conspicuous for it in a group that believed that poetry and prose were things you might live as well as write this was a part of the harlem renaissance that may not have survivedor been resurrected thurman was fond of the first sentence of rafael sabatinis scaramouch he was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad he thought it applied to himself on the whole however his taste in novels ran to dostoevsky proust sherwood anderson and theodore dreiser especially the latter he made them  his examples in another period perhaps he might have become a brilliant stylist like baldwin but in the twenties he tried to avoid polished prose he made a point of writing very fast and changing very little in the hope of achieving a kind of roughshod power something like that of dreiser he said there may have been another reason consciously or unconsciously he may have felt that for him time was limited he died of tuberculosis and there may have been prior indications but before he was finally stricken he published the blacker the berry as well as two lesser novels wrote much for the magazines saw his play harlem produced on broadway did bales of writing for mass media including movies and worked for a popular publisher as a sort of handyman in thurmans reflections on literature growing out of wide and attentive reading something like the baldwin sharpness was expressed reading an article by james baldwin in the new york times magazine or harpers today one who knew and read thurman will find himself stopped now and then realizing that here thurman would have warmly concurred in the greater seriousness of james baldwin however in the vast distance between the goals the two set for themselves as writers there is more to contrast than to compare where baldwin and the renaissance writer he most nearly resembles are concerned to what extent this difference of stance indeed difference of outlook reflects the diminishing of some forms of the resistance met by negro writers in the past is an open question but certainly no essayist of the twenties showed comparable power no prose writer of that era except toomer had his precision and style none was more exciting there are some indications that the personal histories of baldwin and thurman might have a good bit in common without resorting to speculation baldwin makes no secret of the blood and tears so to speak that have already gone into the forging of his talent the two novels that have resulted thus far include one that was widely praised and one that was widely read go tell it on the mountain garnered most of the praise giovannis room a good many more readers one gathers his notes of a native son however appears to have been more influential than either giving rise to a lively debate between those who esteem baldwin more for his essays than his fiction and those who would put it the other way round his nobody knows my name is a current sensation in any case a group of younger writers which starts with two such figures as ellison and baldwin need not fear that it will be ignored or fail to receive serious attention its constituents have only to establish that they belong on the roster louis e lomax whose essays have been appearing in harpers magazine and elsewhere recently whose book the reluctant african won the anisfield wolf award this year certainly qualifies interestingly his work has more than a little in common with that of walter white of the twenties as a writer except that lomax has published no fiction yet some critics have been mean enough to suggest that it might have been better if white hadnt either but put whites contributions to the century and other periodicalsof that decadebeside lomax of todays bracket rope and faggot with the reluctant african and you get a pair you might call them the georgia boys the young walter white made use of the excellent perspective of the lightskinned negro writer passing for white to get inside lynch mobs and make his report something beyond journalism seemed to result not favored by this special circumstance lomax has benefited from another that was not available to a writer of his type in the twenties television foremost among the writers of the present crop who have chosen journalism as their medium however is carl t rowan of the minneapolis tribune winner of three successive sigma delta chi newspaper awards together with its coveted medallion in  author of south of freedom the pitiful and the proud go south to sorrow and coauthor with jackie robinson of wait till next year rowan has been a frequent contributor to look the saturday evening post and other magazines of the widest circulation more recently he has been rewarded with an appointment as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs journalistically at least rowan is one from the ranks of the newest negro writers who may be said to glitter when he walks no member of the renaissance group enjoyed the same kind or even comparable success it is possible however to see in the short stories of alston anderson as collected in the volume lover man a poignant reminder of the now almost forgotten short fiction of eric d waldron whose tropic death pleased the critics in the harlem period and made its authors career one to watch in those days there are those who are still waiting for more waldron who refuse to believe that the talent that created these authentic and throbbing tales more than thirty years ago could have ever stopped creating given normal health they keep expecting something he may have written and stashed away to come to light none of which is to say of course that the mentioning of anderson in the same breath with waldron suggests any likeness whatever in their personalities or in their writing careers apart from the single volumes of short stories by which each is principally known however there is another point both these writers have the west indies and panama in their backgrounds the harlem flavor captured by julian mayfield in his novels the hit the long night and the grand parade is very close to that which inspired rudolph fishers short stories and novels in the twenties like fisher too mayfield is a man of many talents he was an actor in a leading role in lost in the stars and he has had a play produced offbroadway while he has done more with the novel less with the shorter fiction than did fisher the similarities the reminders are definitely there and if the harlem renaissance group had no lorraine hansberry and no carl t rowan neither have the present group of negroes writers poets comparable to claude mckay countee cullen and langston hughes it remains to be seen whether paule marshall can replace the gifted zora neale hurston the harlem group also included helene johnson dorothy west frank horne sterling brown nella larson and the two fausets jessie r and arthur huff of course the present lot can point to good material among their reserves frank london brown le roi jones gloria oden john o killens herbert simmons melvin kelley are definitely coming on but it will take the best by all of these to fill the firmament as did the literary stars that brightened the harlem sky in the twenties 
means to me

hree years in paris t rehabilitated me i went there originally for three weeks to rest and play an engagement before i left america unknown to anyone adam and i had a little talk i was not too happy with the work situation here and i was not happy personally adam said if youre not happy here why dont you stay over there a while and work the three weeks stretched out to three years they were for the most part gay funfilled workfilled years after a year skipper my son joined me we took a large apartment in paris which we still have and occasionally we went down to cannes to live with friends on the riviera during this period i entertained at clubs all over the continent and in north africa and the near east  my three years out of america were three years of much needed rest not from work but from racial tension and by that i do not mean that i never run into racism that would not be true but whenever i encountered racism in any form it was so rare that it was an exception rather than the rule and it stuck out as an incident im not going to say that france is paradise but i will say this you can live anywhere if youve got the money to live you can go anywhere if youve got the money to go and whomever you marry or date is your business since my return to america i have been attacked by some uninformed people who say i ran away from the problem in one new york hotel where i was staying the room service waiter said i once thought you were the greatest but you have fallen in my estimation because you left america where the fight is well im here to tell you that roughly  per cent of the armed service personnel overseas are southerners people who have never been exposed to racist thinking are being told what the southern white man thinks of the negro the fight is not confined to america it is worldwide a friend told me upon billie holidays return to the united states she called me the queen of the mau maus she meant this as a compliment she said it because of the affection and esteem the african students of paris hold for me i appeared in two french movies with some of the top french stars i also signed to play the lead in a french version of anna lucasta but a legal hassle over rights to the play prevented the producer from staging it between engagements i relaxed and absorbed the healthy restful atmosphere of paris my paris is not the city of champagne and caviar my paris is a pot full of red beans and rice and an apartment full of old friends and glasses tinkling and the rich happy sound of people laughing from the heart my paris is the warmth of the big thanksgiving dinners i had every year for my old and dear friends my paris is the enchantment of wandering through an old museum hand in hand with an old friend from hollywood lost in the wonder of rodin my paris is the magic of looking up the champs elysees from the place de la concorde and being warmed by the merry madness of the lights my paris is like the very first time you  realize youre in love like the very first time youre kissed paris is all this and more but it is also pain while i was there some of my dearest friends died and some were murdered i lost lester young and billie holiday and i went to the very door of death myself after a serious operation lester who is not was such a beautiful individual came to see me every day during my recuperation and we listened for hours on end to frank sinatras album only the lonely it pains me to remember that he went from my apartment to an airplane which took him to america and death paris is billie holiday too i remember her one night toward the end singing a bitter blues trying to say everything trying to explain everything within the confines of twelve bars she had been robbed again and she was blue sitting there in the mars club in paris listening to this woman who represents not represented so many years of my life sitting there remembering how she used to protect me and curse me and run me home when i was  and working on nd street in new york i was overcome by all the tragedy all the greatness and all the beauty of her life i had my own problems too anna lucasta had just collapsed and i was sort of inbetween and wandering while wondering where i was going and what i was doing i began to cry billie stopped gripped my arm and dragged me to a back room and slammed the door the next time you begin to feel like this she said just remember that youve got skipper and lady only has a little chihuahua and ladys making it and another thing never let them see you cry isnt that a wonderful fantastic thing to say never let them see you cry i learned a lot in paris about people and about myself one does not look into the face of death as i have and come away worrying about pettiness and cattiness and gossip and conforming it seems that everytime i am near death someone or something is asking me over and over how stupid can you get how many changes will you need before you find out whats important this last time when i spent a month or so in bed i got the message i am not likely ever to forget it love is important love some people go to their graves without ever learning that very simple lesson 
negro officials after the civil war
by dr john hope franklin
the act of march   was specific about the qualifications of those who were to have a voice in the new program of reconstruction constitutions were to be written by delegates to be elected by the male citizens of the state twentyone years old and upward of whatever race color or previous condition who have been resident in said state for one year    except such as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony at common law it was no easy task to administer satisfactorily these provisions of the act the commanding generals in  the southern military districts were hard pressed to find competent and qualified registrars to enroll the electorate they used union army officers and freedmens bureau agents and a few of them used some negroes travel into remote areas was difficult and in some instances weeks elapsed before registrations were received compiled and made ready for elections some of the commanding generals felt a deep responsibility to provide a little political education for those voters who had never had the experience or the opportunity to participate in politics several of them gave explicit instructions to registration officials to provide the freedmen with adequate information regarding their political rights freedmens bureau officers and agents engaged by the generals to work in the registration program helped the new voters understand their rights and duties when bureau officials had no political literature of their own to distribute they disseminated materials prepared by the union league which was as we shall see easily the most active organization in the political education of the negro when the criteria for becoming electors were applied to the people of the south three groups qualified one group was the vast majority of negroes whose loyalty to the union was unquestioned and who merely had to prove that they were not felons and had lived in the state one year another was the northerners who had taken up residence in the south if they met the residence requirements they were enrolled finally there were the native southerners who qualified to take the ironclad oath and who were scrutinized with the greatest care the rank and file among these groups was to be the center of the controversy that raged over the ensuing decade out of these groups were to come the leaders who bore the majority responsibility for both the good and the evils flowing from the difficult task of rebuilding the south the entrance of negroes into the political arena was the most revolutionary aspect of the reconstruction program out of a population of approximately four million some  qualified as voters but the most of them were without the qualifications to participate effectively in a democracy in this they were not unlike the large number of americans who were enfranchised during the age of jackson or the large number of immigrants who were being voted in herds by political bosses in new york boston and other american cities at this time they were the first to admit their deficiencies beverly nash an unlettered former slave sitting in the south carolina convention expressed the views of many when he said i believe my friends and fellowcitizens we are not prepared for this suffrage but we can learn give a man tools and let him commence to use them and in time he will learn a trade so it is with voting we may not understand it at the start but in time we shall learn to do our duty like nash most of the negroes were illiterate a slave existence could hardly be expected to prepare one for the responsibilities of citizenship especially when there were laws as there were in all slave states banning the teaching of slaves even if negroes were free as were more than  in the slave states before the war laws forbade their being taught to read and write indeed when they came out of slavery many negroes did not know their own names many did not even have family names it goes without saying that a considerable number had not the vaguest notion of what registering and voting meant none of this is surprising it had been only two years since emancipation from a system that for more than two centuries had denied slaves most rights as human beings and it must be remembered that in these two years the former confederates in power all over the south did nothing to promote the social and political education of the former slaves what is surprising is that there were someand no paltry numberwho in  were able to assume the responsibilities of citizens and leaders among south carolinas negro leaders was state treasurer francis l cardozo educated at glasgow and london who had been a minister in new haven and after the war was principal of a negro school in charleston robert b elliott born in massachusetts trained at eton college in england and elected to congress in  was urbane and articulate j j wright a state supreme court justice had studied at the university of pennsylvania and had been a respected member of the pennsylvania bar before moving to south carolina after the war congressman james rapiers white father sent him to school in canada and when he returned to his native alabama after the war he had not only an ample formal education but a world of experience gained from travel and work in the north floridas secretary of state jonathan c gibbs graduated from dartmouth college and had been a presbyterian minister for several years when reconstruction began among the negro leaders of north carolina james w hood assistant superintendent of public instruction and james h harris an important figure in the  constitutional convention were educated respectively in pennsylvania and ohio many others among them henry m turner of the georgia legislature hiram revels united states senator from mississippi and richard h gleaves member of congress from south carolina had much more than the rudiments of a formal education when they entered upon their official duties significant among negro leaders were those who were almost wholly selfeducated robert smalls of south carolina pursued his studies diligently until he had mastered the rudiments later he went to the united states house of representatives in mississippi john roy lynch regularly took time off from his duties in a photographers studio to gaze across the alley into a white schoolroom where he kept up with the class until he had mastered the courses taught there when he became speaker of the mississippi house and later a member of congress he relied on this earlier training before jefferson long went into congress from georgia he had educated himself and had become a merchant tailor in macon there were numerous other selfeducated negro leaders including john carraway and peyton finley of alabama james ohara and a h galloway of north carolina and james w bland and lewis lindsay of virginia from this educated element came the articulate responsible negroes who contributed substantially to the writing of the new constitutions and the establishment of the new governments in the former slave states most of the negro leaders were ministers a fair number taught school some were employees of the freedmens bureau or another federal agency here and there one found a negro who had been trained in the law there were of course farmers and there were some artisans engaged in a variety of occupations the economic interests and aspirations of the negro leaders varied widely it would be wrong to assume that they had no economic interests or that they had no views regarding the economic future of the south one of the really remarkable features of the negro leadership was the small amount of vindictiveness in their words and their actions there was no bully no swagger as they took their places in the state and federal governments traditionally occupied by the white planters of the south the spirit of conciliation pervaded most of the public utterances the negroes made in his first speech in the south carolina convention beverly nash asserted that the southern white man was the true friend of the black man pointing to the banner containing the words united we stand divided we fall nash said if you could see the scroll of the society that banner represents you would see the white man and the black man standing with their arms locked together as the type of friendship and union which we desire negroes generally wished to see political disabilities removed from the whites in south carolina several negroes presented a resolution asking congress to remove all such disabilities and it was passed in louisiana the negroes requested that former confederates be permitted to vote but for the time being not to hold office in alabama james t rapier a negro delegate to the constitutional convention successfully sponsored a resolution asking congress to remove the political disabilities of those who might aid in reconstruction in mississippi a democratic paper the jackson clarion admitted that in their general conduct negroes have  shown consideration for the feelings of the whites  in other words the colored people had manifested no disposition to rule or dominate the whites and the only color line which had existed grew out of the unwise policy which had previously been pursued by the democratic party in its efforts to prevent the enjoyment by the newlyemancipated race of the rights and privileges to which they were entitled under the constitution and laws of the country in south carolina beverly nash declared that in public affairs we must unite with our white fellowcitizens they tell us that they have been disfranchised yet we tell the north that we shall never let the halls of congress be silent until we remove that disability negroes attempted no revolution in the social relations of the races in the south francis b simkins in his new viewpoints of southern reconstruction has accurately observed that the defiance of the traditional caste division occasionally expressed in an official reception or in an act of the legislature was not reflected generally in common social relations negroes as a rule conceded to the insistence of whites that they were a race apart and they made little or no attempt to invade social privacies they did not even attempt to destroy white supremacy except where such supremacy rejected negroes altogether as human beings and there was almost nowhere any serious consideration given to providing legal approbation of interracial marriages while negroes sought equality as human beings they manifested no desire to involve themselves in the purely social relations of whites as individuals or as groups it is false it is a wholesale falsehood to say that we wish to force ourselves upon white people declared the nearwhite p b s pinchback of louisiana nor did any considerable number of negroes seek to effect an economic revolution in the south henry mcneal turner the fearless negro leader who was almost universally disliked by white georgians did what he could to assist the whites in recovering their economic strength in the georgia convention he secured the passage of two resolutions that indicated a remarkable willingness to stabilize the economic life of the white community one sought to prevent the sale of property whose owners were unable to pay their taxes the other provided for the relief of banks in south carolina negro leaders such as robert delarge and francis cardozo supported relief measures with the full knowledge that whites would benefit as much as negroes the movement of northerners into the south after the civil war is a part of the exciting drama of the migrations that had seen the continent populated from ocean to ocean and had taken americans new and old wherever opportunity beckoned the movement into the south was greatly stimulated by the favorable observations of scores of thousands of union soldiers who had seen action on southern battlefields some were mustered out of the army while still in the south and despite some southern feelings of hostility against them decided to adopt the south  as their home others back in their northern homes waited only for the  first opportunity to return to the south by the fall of  for example more than five thousand union soldiers had settled in louisiana alone the movement was also stimulated by the large number of industrialists and investors who saw in the underdeveloped south an important new  economic frontier those committed to the view that the souths recovery from the war would be accompanied by an era of unparalleled expansion began to move into the region bringing with them their own resources and often the resources of others with which to build railroads and factories and to purchase farm land and other properties many federal agentssome from the department of the treasury  others from the freedmens bureausettled in the south and called it home northern teachers men and women braved numerous indignities at the hands of hostile whites in order to teach negroes and they cast their lot with the south there were those from the north moreover who saw new political opportunities in the south they hoped to use the newly enfranchised element and the problems arising out of reconstruction to achieve political power and economic gain for them the south was a happy hunting ground that they could not resist as to any frontier there went to the south the adventurers those who wanted to get rich quick and neerdowells who were fully prepared to embrace any cause including radical reconstruction that would benefit them these were the people who have been called carpetbaggers for the last ninety years this opprobrious term used as early as  to describe any suspicious stranger was applied indiscriminately to all northerners in the south during reconstruction it has generally implied that as a group they had nothing in the way of worldly possessions and were thoroughly unprincipled in their determination to fleece and exploit the south until their carpetbags fairly bulged with the possessions of southerners and they were forced to acquire new coffers in which to place their illgotten gains they have been described as a group at work on a grand master plan to africanize the country one historian described them as gangs of itinerant adventurers vagrant interlopers who were too depraved dissolute dishonest and degraded to get the lowest of places in the states they had just left these descriptions fall far short of the mark they impugn the integrity and good intentions of thousands whose motives were otherwise even more important perhaps is the fact that such descriptions show no understanding of the variety and complexity of the motives underlying the migrations and no appreciation for the economic and political relationships that grew out of such motives there is no evidence that even the considerable number of negro migrants from the north were interested in africanizing the country indeed the term was an extravagance a flourishlike negro rule used to express disgust the other common descriptions are equally inaccurate as thomas conway pointed out a few months after the war many northerners including the teacher preacher merchant husbandman mechanic laborer and discharged union soldier were ready to move south he had persuaded northern men to take  into the south to purchase land make loans and advances on crops their only fears were whether there was sufficient law and order to maintain security for their investments but they went south and they continued to go all during the reconstruction period in november  sidney andrews observed that already several massachusetts men were in business in charleston and he estimated that at least half the stores on the principal streets of the city were run by northern men the careers of captain h s chamberlain and general john t wilder both of ohio illustrate the kind of activities in which numerous socalled carpetbaggers were engaged when chamberlain was mustered out of the union army in knoxville tennessee in  he at once entered the iron and coal business in knoxville and is regarded by some as the real founder of the modern iron industry south of the ohio in  chamberlain joined with general wilder later of wilders lightning brigade of ohio to organize the roane iron company which bought large tracts of coal and iron land and engaged extensively in the operation of coke works iron mines and furnaces together they became involved in many industrial and financial ventures including the dixie portland cement company the brookside cotton mills of knoxville and the first national bank of chattanooga that all socalled carpetbaggers were not simply radicals with no consideration for the welfare and development of the south can be seen also in the life of willard warner planter politician and iron manufacturer born in granville ohio and educated at marietta college warner served in the union army and went to the ohio senate in  two years later he moved to alabama and with his ample resources engaged in cotton planting for several years he became active in republican politics and served in the united states senate from  to  then he organized the tecumseh iron company and served as president and manager until  for this venture more than  was supplied by his northern associates later he moved to tennessee where he had extensive investments and blast furnaces the overthrow of reconstruction seems not to have affected this carpetbagger for as late as  the conservatives the democrats in his adopted state elected him to the tennessee legislature if recent historians have reviled northerners who settled in the south after the civil war their southern contemporaries were inclined to be grateful to them for their contributions to southern development clinton a cilley born in new hampshire and a harvard graduate settled in north carolina in  after a career in law including several years as a judge of the lenoir superior court he was called in  one of north carolinas ablest lawyers and finest citizens general wilder the iron manufacturer was very popular among southerners including former confederates during the spanishamerican war the governor of tennessee named the training camp near knoxville camp wilder in honor of the carpetbagger from ohio lieutenant b h true of the th new york volunteers who settled in georgia in  was consistently popular with his new neighbors they not only supported his newspaper the appeal and advertiser but elected him as the celebrated farmer from morgan county to the state agricultural society the interest of such men and groups of men in the political future of the south was real with so much at stake in the way of investments and with full appreciation of the economic potential of the south they could not be indifferent to the uncertain political winds that were blowing across their adopted home their interest transformed itself into a strong desire to attain certain specific political goals for the south one was the achievement and maintenance of law and order they had seen enough hostility and lawlessness in many southern communities to cause considerable uneasiness about the safety of their investments they wanted governments that would insure this safety and if they could facilitate the establishment of such governments they would certainly do so another was the maintenance of a close alliance between government and the business community they had seen the importance of such an alliance in numerous developments in washington during the war and in the effective service that several state governments in the north had rendered the business community favorable banking and insurance laws tax exemptions or rebates land grants and other assistance to railroads were among the favors the government could and would under certain desirable circumstances grant to business and industry if at all possible northerners would see that this was done in the south finally most northerners in the south were convinced that their goals could best be attained through a vigorous wellorganized republican party throughout the south this was after all the party responsible for the intimate relationship between government and business on the national level and in several northern state governments they knew that there was little chance of luring the former confederates into the republican party and that the democratic party would oppose at every turn whatever republicans attempted to do southern democrats tended to equate republicans with abolitionists and thus to regard them as the destroyers of the souths cherished economic and social system northern republicans had to look to others in the south for political support a republican in the south did not have to belong to the thaddeus stevenscharles sumner wing of the party to reach the conclusion that negro suffrage was not only desirable but imperative for the conclusion was inescapable that the partys strength would come from negroes and from whatever support they could secure from loyal native southerners they did all they could to promote the enfranchisement of the negro and draw him into the republican party this did not mean however that the socalled carpetbaggers were interested in africanizing the south even when they undertook to northernize the south there was no revolution in the general social relations between negroes and whites b h true a new yorker living in georgia said that he was as friendly toward the negro as anyone but there is an antagonism which we all have against the race that i cannot get rid of i do not believe any man can had these radicals been radical on social questions they would have opposed the laws against intermarriage that were enacted during the radical regime they would also have stood for one system of public schools open to all races but their infrequent expressions in favor of such a system were feeble indeed these matters unlike negro suffragewere not among their primary interests and they gave them scant attention it was only natural that northerners in the south could wield political influence and exercise power far out of proportion to their numbers they were the best prepared to step into the vacuum created by the disfranchisement of the former confederates they had training and experience in political and economic matters that neither negroes nor loyal native southerners had they clearly knew what their interests were and how best they could be secured finally they had the support of the powerful victorious party that was in control of affairs in washington while their influence in the south was not always decisive or even critical it was invariably a factor in the determination of affairs present and future in the southern states no group of postwar southern leaders has been reviled or castigated or misunderstoodmore than loyal native southerners commonly known as scalawags the term came in all likelihood from scalloway a district in the shetland islands where small runty cattle and horses were bred it was used in western new york before the civil war in referring to a mean fellow a scape grace in the south the term was used by the opponents of reconstruction to describe those they regarded as the lowest meanest element in society these were the southerners who could swear that they had never voluntarily given aid countenance counsel or encouragement to persons in rebellion and had exercised or attempted to exercise the functions of no office under the confederacy they were largely men who had opposed secession the votes against secession in some state legislatures together with the known sentiment against such drastic action indicates that a considerable number of southerners dragged their feet or refused to have any part in the confederate cause many had for years smarted under a system that gave every advantage to the planter class to which very few of them belonged they bitterly resented the course of action pursued by the planter class which had led to a war that from their point of view became more and more a poor mans fight it is impossible to determine how many socalled scalawags were qualified to participate in reconstruction under the terms of the several acts of congress likewise it is impossible to determine the extent to which those who took the ironclad oath were eligible to do so after june  those who took the oath were as president johnson had indicated to the commanding generals judges of their own honesty since the machinery as well as the personnel of registration was of questionable efficiency it is entirely possible that many who were clearly not eligible registered anyway there were some eligibles who refused to register and many who were not eligible advised the loyal southerners to have no part in the radical regime others advised the eligibles to register and then defeat the radical effort by voting against it if we are to wear manacles said governor perry of south carolina let them be put on by our tyrants not ourselves but there were those in the south who counseled loyal southerners to participate in the new reconstruction program and then to restrain any excessive or revolutionary tendencies that might militate against the best interests of the south the fact that negroes were to participate did not degrade white southerners or diminish their influence unless they purposely abandoned the field to negroes the new orleans picayune told its readers that promptness in registering and voting would convince the north that we mean to take care of our own affairs the savannah news gave similar advice when it declared that georgia expected every man to do his duty and register without delay to show his reverence for his noble commonwealth the charleston daily courier echoed the same view that you should register is an imperative duty which each man owes to himself to his community and to his state a curious assortment of native southerners thus became eligible to participate in radical reconstruction and the number increased as the president granted individual pardons or issued new proclamations of amnesty it became increasingly difficult to make a distinction between the views of the loyal southerners and the views of those whose citizenship was being restored on political and social questions they ranged from the radicalism of james w hunnicut of virginia who stood for the full legal and social equality of negroes and whites to the conservatism of milton candler a georgia senator who claimed that negroes were not citizens and therefore were not eligible to hold office certainly the majority of these loyal southerners could not be described as radicals in the sense of embracing the policies and program for negroes set forth by the radicals in congress often they advocated segregation of negroes and whites in educational and other institutions often they spoke as vigorously for the rights of the south as did any former confederate their primary interest was in supporting a party that would build the south on a broader base than the plantation aristocracy of antebellum days they found it expedient to do business with negroes and socalled carpetbaggers but often they returned to the democratic party as it gained sufficient strength to be a factor in southern politics these were the people who were called scalawags by their adversaries they hardly deserved the name nor did they deserve the numerous other opprobrious labels pinned on them by hostile critics wade hampton called them the mean lousy and filthy kind that are not fit for butchers or dogs another called them scaly scabby runts in a herd of cattle even the historians have joined in the verbal assault on these loyal native southerners one describes scalawags as vile blatant vindicative unprincipled perhaps during the period of their ascendancy the scalawags committed many offenses against the social order for the graft and corruption they must take at least a part of the blame but their most serious offense was to have been loyal to the union during the civil war or to have declared that they had been loyal and thereby to have enjoyed full citizenship during the period of radical reconstruction it is extremely difficult to determine the strength of the three groups that dominated the south during radical reconstruction there was constant fluctuation in the show of strength particularly among the native southerners and the northerners living in the south and there was constant defection with negroes dropping out of the picture under ku klux klan or other pressures with northerners leaving or going over to the conservatives as the opponents of radical reconstruction were called and with loyal southerners deviating from or deserting the radical cause altogether the best that one can do is look at the comparative numerical strength of the three groups and draw some inferences from the observation a likely time for such a comparison is  when the several state conventions wrote the new constitutions required by the reconstruction acts the figures    illustrate several significant points in the first place except for south carolina negroes enjoyed no numerical domination in the conventions the only other state in which they were nearly a majority was louisiana where by agreement they were to constitute  per cent of the delegates thus negro rule as reconstruction has been erroneously described had an inauspicious beginning and indeed was never to materialize second the socalled carpetbaggers were in the minority in every state except mississippi many were so preoccupied with personal undertakings or with setting up schools and churches that they had no time for public service their position however was adequately represented by those new settlers who did find time to serve finally the native whites had a larger numerical representation in the conventions than is usually recognized dominating several conventions such as those in alabama georgia and north carolina and having substantial numbers in others they were prepared to play a significant part in the deliberations and in the administration of affairs in their states although leadership in the south came from these three groups at least in the early days of congressional reconstruction it does not follow that the leaders invariably worked together in promoting a radical program their motives values and goals were not the same and their effort to work together was often strained because of these differences far from entering into any conspiracy to degrade and destroy the southern way of life they frequently worked at cross purposes at times the position of the negro leaders approached that of the crusading abolitionists meanwhile the socalled carpetbaggers frequently preoccupied themselves with building up the alliance between the business community and the republicancontrolled state government all too often moreover the loyal southerners talked and acted like the conservative former confederates whom they presumably opposed cooperation was at best loose and irregular forced at times only by the threat of their common destruction it was under these circumstances that the three groups of leaders forged a program for the reconstruction of the southern states how such a program actually emerged is one of the fascinating chapters in american history

which way is jazz going questions of this kind are never easy to answer and in this case it might be easier to answer another question namely where is jazz coming from because one of the most important distinctions between the musical scenes of yesterday and today is that the average young musician nowadays comes equipped with conservatory experience with a background of educational equipment that is way out ahead of the training most of the musicians had not too many years ago as far as the future of jazz is concerned it is by no means certain that this will be the only factor in determining which way things will go whether jazz will be more folklike in nature or less whether it will be less or more mechanical is not important what is important is that it must live and the only way it can live is with the existence of an ever larger and more keenly interested audience to give it the support that must always be its life blood jazz like any other form of art has to be subsidized if there are more intelligent listeners of course it will move in a more intelligent direction this does not necessarily mean however that it will leave the realm of folk music and tend to move into a more mecanique type of thing recently i was asked whether i felt that jazz had moved a great distance away from its folk origins with the present state of rockandroll music i dont know how anyone can even consider asking such a question rockandroll is the most raucous form of jazz beyond a doubt it maintains a link with the folk origins and i believe that no other form of jazz has ever been accepted so enthusiastically by so many this is probably an easy medium of musical semantics for the people to assimilate im not trying to imply by this that rockandroll shows any single trend or indicates the only direction in which things are moving it is simply one aspect out of many i have written a number of rockandroll things myself but am saving them for possible use in a show as far as my own music in general is concerned i would categorize it as negro music it represents what i absorbed as a child and have grown up with among the people around me who were musicians and beyond that my own self and my surroundings have been injected into it there have been many rebellions concerning our music through the years as far back as  when i said i was playing negro music some critics complained sophisticated lady is not negro music but the fact remains that sophisticated lady is negro musicits the negro i know and my interpretation no matter how many controversies may rage about the direction in which our music or jazz in general is going the music will continue to develop along natural lines some of it may become more complex and some of it will remain simple there will always be some kind of folk music around be it rockandroll or western or hillbilly music actually the word simple is sometimes misleading and is subject to many interpretations take for instance a recent composition entitled night creature we gave this number its premiere at carnegie hall performed by our orchestra combined with the symphony of the aira total of  men despite this i feel that night creature basically was done in quite a simple manner it could have been developed into something far more complex and elaborate but essentially it tried to tell a rather simple story in fairly simple language the main purpose of it was to try to make the symphony swing which i believe we did very successfully what we did with night creature was in effect a new argument on a much larger scale than ever before against the theory that jazz cannot be written there are still a few diehards around who believe in this in fact not long ago i made up a little story to interpret their attitude there was a little raggedy boy out in the middle of a field he was wandering through the grass and stumbled over what appeared to be a black stick he picked it up and sat down under a weeping willow tree we of course know that it was a clarinet he was holding but he didnt know what it was but somehow or other intuition told him to just blow on itand when he blew out came jazz and thats the way jazz is supposed to be according to these diehardsits not supposed to be prepared or planned in any way another theory they hold is that there is such a thing as unadulterated improvisation without any preparation or anticipation it is my firm belief that there has never been anybody who has blown even two bars worth listening to who didnt have some idea about what he was going to play before he started if you just ramble through the scales or play around the chords thats nothing more than musical exercises improvisation really consists of picking out a device here  and connecting it with a device there changing the rhythm here and pausing there there has to be some thought preceding each phrase that is played otherwise it is meaningless so as i say jazz today as always in the past is a matter of thoughtful creation not mere unaided instinct and although it is impossible for me or anyone else to paint any accurate picture of things to come i am sure that it will develop into something very big and beautiful it will be a combination of the contribution of all those people who are supposed to have natural ability and the work of all those who come out of the conservatories to add their embellishments as you may know i have always been against any attempt to categorize or pigeonhole music so i wont attempt to say whether the music of the future will be jazz or not jazz whether it will merge or not merge with classical music there are simply two kinds of music good music and the other kind classical writers may venture into classical territory but the only yardstick by which the result should be judged is simply that of how it sounds if it sounds good its successful if it doesnt it has failed as long as the writing and playing is honest whether its done according to hoyle or not if a musician has an idea let him put it down on paper and lets not worry about whether the result is jazz or this or that type of performance lets just say that what were all trying to create in one way or another is american music

t hope you do not mind j said my host herr john tesch i would like to ask you a question i told him of course that i did not mind frau tesch smiled politely and refilled my coffee cup tell me did you go to school with white boys and girls in america he asked to myself i thought well here we go the old problem again to herr tesch i replied yes i did was there the same kind of violence at your school as there was at little rock and did the whites try to keep you out of school i told him there was no violence at all then i explained that in detroit where i went to school white and negro children attend the same schools with no more than the usual conflicts common to children everywhere this was stretching a point and overlooking some school boundary gerrymandering here and there but it was true enough then would you please tell us what the problem is at little rock i reflected a moment before plunging into this now routine and expected discussion i explained that little rock was in the south the nations traditionally segregated section i cited the fouryearold supreme court ruling against separate schools i skimmed the surface of the political significance of governor faubuss action in calling out the national guard to frustrate the implementation of the courts ruling and explained that this left the president virtually no alternative but to support the court with federal troops my position was not a comfortable one it never is at these times  europeans who actually are unfamiliar with continental united states are prone to see racial incidents there in terms of stark blacks and whites for many of them there is no significant distinction between little rock and detroit it is after all america if violence is perpetrated against a negro in montgomery the picture they get in their minds is simple whites attack negroes the regional and historical circumstances we customarily cite to excuse or extenuate the outbreak cannot serve the same purpose for them i glanced at the faces of herr and frau tesch their eyes were full of sympathy for me and for all the negroes in america and they were unquestionably sincere but i wondered if they would have the same sympathy and compassion if they lived in say maryland or indiana instead of in switzerland i would not prejudge them and yet this thought had occurred to me many times during talks with europeans who expressed outrage at racism in america as a reporter in detroit and chicago i learned that many of the whites most aggressive in barring negroes from housing schools and parks were first and second generation americans we had only just finished dining and removed to the living room for coffee cake and brandy the coffee was excellent perhaps the best i had tasted in all europe and the cake especially purchased for the occasion was delicious for dinner frau tesch had prepared what she called a typical swiss dish one we reserve to share with good friends it was a magnificent cheese fondue served with kirsch and tea and it was indeed a significant gesture at friendship the fondue casserole piping hot and kept that way over alcohol flames was placed in the center of the elegantly appointed table a huge platter piled with neatly cut sections of bread was put alongside to eat the fondue each diner had to take a square of bread with his fork and dip it into the chafing dish it was as intimate a meal as if the three of us were eating from the same plate the kirsch and brandy had mellowed my host and now relaxed in his easy chair in the compact but cozy room he was ready for an evening of quiet talk herr tesch holds a very responsible job in the finance department of the canton of bern a governmental division roughly comparable to an american county he is a seriousmiened and seriousminded man not yet forty very proud of his swiss ancestry and of the national swiss character which is conservative almost to an extreme he was emphatic in asserting his own conservative views but he was genuinely baffled and disturbed by the american mentality as demonstrated in incidents like that at little rock we find it difficult to understand he told me i dont think such things could happen in switzerland the racists behave as though negroes are not americans too swiss people might individually have dislike for negroes or might not wish to associate with them but i think it is inconceivable for the swiss to want to deny rights to other swiss or other people simply because they dislike them there is something so inhuman in that and especially when children are made to suffer i agreed herr tesch went on it seems to me these things are very bad for america your country is engaged  in trying to influence other nations to your side countries in the middle east asia and africa surely america must know these nations will not respect americas message of freedom when negroes in america do not even have freedom here my swiss friend was not voicing a mere opinion following the korean war he had served on a united nations commission in that divided land he met and talked with thinking young men from several countries of asia and africa and they were all acutely aware of the great disparity between americas preachment and practice of democracy i told him there were many important americans who understood this very well but that there was little they could do beyond stating their case and appealing to reason there is something else something which bears only indirectly on these matters of race but i think it is important herr tesch said even in countries where the matter of race is no problem there is suspicion and distrust of america because of what happens to negroes there for example it is believed there is oil in the mountains here the swiss people do not have the capital to drill for oil and there are american firms which are interested but the swiss are reluctant to invite the americans in this might give them an opportunity to dominate our economy and our customs can americans be fair to others when they are not even fair to their own i think not america is the worlds biggest democracy and switzerland is the smallest but we like our brand of democracy better frau tesch a slim attractive young woman whose english was heavily accented had remained quite still during much of the discussion finally speaking very slowly she posed a question now that the situation at little rock seems settled at least for the present do you think there will be other such cases when the schools open again she asked yes i told her yes i think there will be many other such cases you must understand that there also are very powerful and influential forces in america which are dedicated to keeping negroes in a position of inferiority they are well organized and well financed and they will create disorders when and where they choose to she considered my answer for a moment then she shook her head sadly it is such a terrible thing she said yes i said i am afraid it is a terrible thing there was nothing more to say bern switzerland march  
a dangerous day in mississippi
by c eric lincoln
t all began with a promise that i had made the preceding christmas when a fishing rod turned up under the tree for my son cecil eric aged seven a fishing rod at christmas is of course a reasonable implication that there will be some fishing done the following summer the promised day finally arrived and at the crack of dawn lincoln four chubby little hands aided and abetted by a cheering section from the direction of the kitchen did without any ceremony whatever drag me from my slumbers with great insistence that i hurry and make worms come out of the ground with two sticksjust like when i was a boy i couldnt find the right kind of sticks any real fisherman knows that worms wont come up when you rub just any old two sticks together half an hour of spade work netted three worms and two blisters while the others were at breakfast i hurried around the corner to the fishermans one stop s and dug a whole boxful right off the counter for sixty cents back home i dumped them into a tomato can with the three we already had and went in to eat by ten oclock we were finally on our way i made a mental check to see if we had everything wife kids picnic basket fishing rods worms and of course gomer gomer was a fuzzy little puppy of dubious breed and uncertain parentage but gomer was a law unto herself where we went she went i had come to understand it and by majority vote i had to accept it we lived in memphis in the southwest corner of tennessee directly across the mississippi  river to the west is arkansas and any of the highways leading south will land you in mississippi within half an hour or so a system of levees maintained by the u s army engineers protects the low country east of the river from floods and within a few miles of memphis there are a number of bayous between the river and the levees the bayous are widely known for good fishing now the levee which has been made famous by song and storyrises just outside the city limits and follows the river southward into the magnolia state our plan was to drive south on the highway for a few miles and to then turn off on the levee at some likely spot to look for one of the more accessible fishing holes among the bayous none of us noticed or remembered when we crossed the state line into mississippi there were two reasons why this was important one was that i did not have a mississippi fishing license the other was that i am a negro and there was a great deal of racial tension in that state at the time less than two weeks before on my way to memphis from atlanta i had driven more than a hundred miles out of the way to avoid traveling in that state instead of traveling u s  through birmingham and tupelo i had gone around through chattanooga and nashville in order to bypass both alabama and mississippi the emmett till case had stirred up a lot of excitement and preliminary hearings on the murder were then going on in jackson  as we clipped along the highway south of memphis and turned off on the broad levee all this was forgotten however i could only think of how good it was to be out of the city and the prospect of a day of fishing was more than refreshing now that the trip was underway it promised to be fun we kidded and sang as we anticipated the days catch little did we know that what we would catch that day would not be fish to the left of the steep levee were broad bottomlands of corn and pasture rich and verdant in the summer sun the fat whitefaced beef cattle grazing in some of the pastures reminded me that the economic base of the south was changing we saw no cotton only pastureland stretching for mile upon mile along the base of the levee occasionally we could hear the sharp staccato of a tractor and we could see the alfalfa and other silage being cut or raked and baled down the levee on the right rolled the dirtybrown brooding mississippi the father of waters between the river and the levee were occasional sloughs and bayous surrounded for the most part with a dense undergrowth and dotted with the grotesque trunks of cypress trees some of this land was fenced now and then we could see one or two scraggy brown cows switching flies in the edge of the undergrowth in sharp contrast to the fat cattle on the other side of the levee all in all it looked strangely familiarlike contrasting neighborhoods on opposite sides of a trolley line some ten or twelve miles down the levee road we noticed two small bayous in a clearing about fifty yards from the river bank a raingullied gravel road angled down from the levee and into the clearing a barbed wire fence ran along the base of the levee and a weather beaten stockgate brought the road to an abrupt halt  we decided that this was as good a place as any to stop and try our luck besides a quick poll showed that we ourselves were  per cent hungry so i urged the car carefully down the side of the levee toward the bayou young cecil undid the fastenings on the old gate and opened it with a flourish i drove into the enclosure following the crooked road atop the weedgrown embankment between the two small bayous my intention was to drive to the far side of the bayous to find a spot overlooking the river where we could spread our lunch there was no longer any gravel on the road now and the weeds and swamp grass all but obscured the road itself after we had driven almost half way across the embankment i could see that the road just ahead of the car was completely under water worse than that it now appeared that the embankment narrowed steadily as it neared the far side of the bayous we could no longer go forward and there was no way to turn the car around if we got out at all i would have to back the car some forty or fifty yards along a narrow slippery embankment partially under water and overgrown with weeds i got out of the car and went to examine the road behind us to my very great dismay i found that the ground was so soft and spongy that the tires of the car were already sunk in the mud almost up to the rims how does it look my wife asked i caught the strained note of artificial cheer in her voice damp and dirty i answered with equal bravado looks as if well have to back out i stood a moment debating with myself whether it would not be better to let the kids and their mother get out and wade back to safety through the mud and weeds a second look at the tall rank grass suggested that greater safety probably lay with the car the swamplands along the mississippi are well known for harbouring the deadly cottonmouthed water moccasin it was not an easy decision i climbed back into the car and eased it into reverse we inched back along the edge of the bayou and just as i began to feel like congratulating myself on my driving skill my son who was sitting on the rear seat opposite the driver leaped over and tapped me on the shoulder daddy he said with that wellknown tone most fathers recognize as the setting for a pleaseincreasemyallowance request yes what is it i wished very much that he would not divert my attention just then the car seemed to be sliding a little could you please stop the car and let us get out i turned off the ignition the car wasnt moving anyway why do you want to get out i demanded somewhat testily there are snakes out there well if you dont let us get out came the matteroffact rejoinder we are all going to be swimming in the bayou and there are alligators out there the car is getting ready to turn over i think the children had been taught never to panic in the face of danger and if the boy felt that we were actually about to turn over into the bayou i was very proud to note that there was no fear in his voice only intelligent concern  looked back at little joyce she was wide eyed and silent she was not panicky but she was certainly not very happy either for that matter neither was i i got out and sloshed as nonchalantly as i could around to the back of the car no wonder it had seemed to be sliding the right rear wheel had slipped over the soft edge of the bayou and the car had settled on its axle at a crazy angle it was literally hanging over the water and slowly sinking deeper into the soft bank i hurried back around to the other side guess wed better all get out i said in what i hoped was a casual tone of voice the man is right she may go over sure enough and i wouldnt like to have to play hero in this bayou without my swimming trunks ok easy now lets all slide gently over this way and come out on this side easy now easy does it i prayed silently as the evacuation got under way first joyce then mother and finally after an agonizing eternity of seconds cecil popped out on the bank with the picnic basket under one arm and the eternal gomer under the other im hungry he announced without ceremony lets eat first so that we can be strong enough to push it out we made our way carefully back through the grass and weeds and out through the creaking old gate while the girls spread the lunch under a convenient oak i set out to look for help the stalwart sir cecil climbed upon the gate to stand guard hey dad he yelled as i started up the levee youd better come back as soon as you can and get our car out of here or were going to get put in jail right here on this gate it says private keep out  in our enthusiasm to reach the water no one had noticed the weatherworn sign nailed to one of the cross bars on the gate with redoubled apprehension i trudged on up the side of the levee i had scarcely reached the top of the embankment when a car approached traveling in the direction of the highway in response to my waving and shouting the automobile pulled over to the edge of the read and halted it was occupied by a white man a boy of about ten and a suspicious looking collie i pointed down through the trees to where my car hung over the edge of the bayou and explained my predicament as rapidly as i could  boy you shore are in a pickle the man said id shore hate to be in trouble on one of these plantations down here if i was you he shook his head ruefully and spat across the levee for emphasis it was only then that i came to a full realization of the potential gravity of our situation the term plantation forced my attention to the fact that  was in mississippi plantation is a word which is almost never used in reference to a farming operation in tennessee i was in a pickle and i knew it how to get out of it as quickly and expediently as possible was becoming increasingly complex it was to become a great deal more complex before that day was over the white man offered to give me a lift a mile or two down the levee to a point from which i could walk to the plantation store he mentioned to me the boy got on the back seat with the dog and i sat with the driver it turned out that they were from memphis and that they had been hunting cypress knees down along the bayous they had a home workshop where they converted the knees into lamps and other objects for their friends the man said within a few minutes we came to a place where a dirt road angled down the far side of the levee away from the river and lost itself in a forest of tall green corn the man stopped the car and pointed to the road now if youll just follow that lit old road there for about a mile i believe itll bring you out mighty near that store theyve got over there if you cant get anybody over there to help you i expect youll have to go all the way into town to get a wrecker to drag you out cost you some money too i expect this is if anybodyll come boy you sure are in a pickle he added as an unhappy afterthought i thanked him for the ride and made my way down the side of the levee the road ran straight across the longest cornfield id ever seen after nearly half an hour of brisk walking i suddenly found myself in the back yard of a little unpainted cabin an elderly negro woman was drawing water from a well near the edge of the cornfield she told me that the main road was just a little way ahead and that id find the store jest a little ways down to the left it was past noon when i reached the plantation store and there were fifteen or twenty negro fieldhands sitting around under the trees eating their lunches from paper bags two men who seemed to have finished were sitting in a ford pickup parked under a black walnut tree i explained my problem to them and asked if they knew where i could hire someone with a tractor to come and pull me out one of the men immediately climbed out of the truck and left muttering something about it being time to go back to the field the other man who said his name was henry explained that it was the height of the haying season and that all available men were expected to be in the fields helping to get the hay in before the rains should come in another twenty minutes or so the dinnerbreak would be over besides all of the tractors were in the fields in use in the haying operations but henry opined i dont spect you need no tractor nohow this here lil old truckll outpull any tractor boss wheelers got on the place near about anyway he patted the green ford truck with real affection at that moment i was willing to love it too a few more minutes of talk revealed that boss wheeler was the plantation manager or straw boss that they were already behind schedule with the haying and that anyway he wheeler wouldnt be likely to accommodate me with a tractor if the last straw was in the barn and he had a hundred tractors rusting in the shed the only negroes boss wheeler liked were the ones who worked for him henry said i took it that it would be a waste of time to try to see mr wheeler on the other hand henry thought that if mr mac was on the place i might have better luck mr mac he explained was the owner of the plantation and his real name was mcculloch however it seemed that mr mcculloch had gone into memphis to a stock sale the only real alternative lay with henry and his ford i didnt really think the truck could do the job but then there was no choice we could try i explained to henry that he would probably be late getting back to work in the hay fields but that i would pay him for any loss he suffered he said hed have me out and fishing before anybody would miss him henry must have been born an optimist we got into the truck and roared off down the road and off through the cornfield when we had crossed the levee and come down on the other side near the river cecil swung the gate open and henry backed the truck out on the embankment and hitched it to the sadly listing automobile it looked as if the list had increased by about five degrees henry put his truck into second gear and the heavy logchain holding the two vehicles together grew taut as the pickup strained valiantly against the inertia of the heavy chrysler finally the trucks tires began to spin and smoke you could have smelled rubber all over the plantationand in less than five minutes the truck was hopelessly mired in the mud as for the car it had not moved an inchexcept perhaps deeper into the muck of the weedgrown bayou we unhitched the chain and tried to work the truck out but after half an hour we had only succeeded in getting it mired deeper into the oozing mud the transmission was soon resting flat upon the ground  the negro field hand became quite excited he swore at the truck and struck the wheels with a length of chain finally he began to talk to the green ford as if it were a living thing alternately abusing it and then pleading with it to come on out of this ol mudhole at intervals he would leap into the cab and race the engine in a futile effort to shake loose from the awful grip of the mississippi mud eventually a second pickup appeared against the skyline high up on the levee at this point henry became almost incoherent and perspiration stood out upon his black face like glass beads the truck on the levee had turned off down the steep little road approaching the gate through which it had been our fate to come i sensed that it must be carrying the dreaded boss wheeler and that this was responsible for henrys state of agitation i tried to console him by thanking him for trying to help and promising to take the full blame for his predicament looking in my wallet i found seven dollars i gave it all to henry hoping that it could somehow help to make up for the trouble i had inadvertently caused him the pickup truck had stopped just inside the gate and a white man followed by a negro was walking rapidly in our direction suddenly my own apprehension increased my car was stuck in the mud and out of service besides that my wife and children were with me and i had just given away my last dollar if anything should happen to me they couldnt even get home i did have a checkbook but who out here in the wilderness could cash a check except the man on whose property i was a trespasser i studied the planter as he advanced on us he wore khaki trousers and a khaki shirt halflength leather boots and a pith helmet he was bronzed not very tall and looked to be about sixty years old he walked briskly and with a sort of bounce that seemed to carry him over the weeds instead of through them close behind him come willie bob the negro fieldhand who had refused to help henry when i approached them at the plantation store as they drew near henry climbed into the truck and began to spin the wheels more furiously than ever before the planter stopped and sniffed at the burning rubber well ill be damned he said stuck in the mud like toadfrogs both of them willie bob go over there and tell henry to turn that motor off before he sets the river afire turning to me he said thats a heavy car chrysler that little doodle bug of a truck cant pull it out between now and freezing cant pull itself out looks like to me he walked around to the rear of the pickup and tried to peer underneath it i was trying to get across here to do some fishing i tried to explain as soon as i could get a word in thought so thought so the white man interrupted used to be a little old road across here river backs up and washes it out every year you couldnt hardly drive a billygoat across here now let alone a car we both laughed at this and my anxiety began to subside a little mr mcculloch opened the door of the truck and motioned for henry to get out youd better locate yourself over on the other side of the levee before mr wheeler misses you he said or i expect youll catch it henry shuffled his feet and looked uneasily at the truck all mired in the mud he very plainly did not wish to leave that ford truck struck there in that mud never mind the truck mr mcculloch said tell wheeler ive got it willie bob take henry on back to the field and bring one of those tractors over here hell this truck isnt going to walk out of here all by itself the two fieldhands left in the planters truck instead of the awkward silence which might well have attended such an embarrassing situation as the one in which i found myself the next half hour or as fate decreed it the next three hours proved to be an unusual experience in human relations it turned out that some thirty years earlier the mississippi planter had studied pharmacy in atlanta the college of pharmacy from which he had graduated had long since ceased to exist and it had been twenty years since he had revisited that famous georgia city yet his interest in the people and schools the newspapers and other institutions of present day atlanta was as alive as it would have been had he lived there only yesterday we walked back toward the gate and sat down on a log beneath the oak where my wife had spread our picnic lunch by this time the conversation had shifted to farming and cattle raising and finally to how a man trained in pharmacy in atlanta came to be a farmer in mississippi it seems that the mcculloch family had migrated from scotland to this country in the early s settling first in georgia and eventually moving westward to mississippi where they acquired extensive land holdings after the civil war the family scattered some went west to california and alaska many went east to enter the professions of seven brothers only the planters father had remained with the landor what was left of it from his father he had inherited a few hundred acres on the condition that he would live on the land and hold it the lean years of the depression had shrunk the land still more it had been necessary to sell some in order to keep any at all but mcculloch had kept faith with his  father he had stayed with the land and he had never practiced pharmacy again the conversation shifted this time to philosophy and the modern existentialist movement in europe and the question of its influence on modern art mr mcculloch had been reading sartre and we were lost in discussion when the roar of a powerful motor upon the levee announced the return of willie bob as a matter of fact willie bob had already driven down from the levee in the truck and parked it the motor we heard was that of a tractor driven by another hand and balanced precariously on the tractor couplinggrinning sheepishlywas henry mr mcculloch shook his head as long as henry has this truck to drive he said there is practically no chance of any woman ever claiming him for a husband the tractor was hitched to the mired truck with the log chain and in a minute or two the truck was dragged free henry climbed in and drove joyously away however fortune did not so favor us with the car a few minutes of pulling at the heavy chrysler only succeeded in miring the tractor in the mud up to its axles no amount of digging and packing the deep ruts with sticks and rocks seemed to help my embarrassment returned with increase when i heard the planter tell willie bob well have to stop those boys over in the south pasture and borrow their tractor willie bob drove away in the second truck eventually the second tractor arrived with two additional men with them they brought a number of shovels and another heavy log chain when we got the first tractor out we could hitch them both to the car and pull it out easily the possibility was cheering such was not to be the second tractor was hitched to the first and a driver straddled the seat on each they roared and spun their wheels but the muck was simply too soft for traction the second tractor was soon more hopelessly mired than the first the shovels were brought into into play the men dug around the wheels and tamped more rocks and sticks into the mire under them anxious to help i took a shovel and began to dig better let me have that shovel the white man said i never saw a college professor who could dig his weight in half a dayexcept at a dinner table he laughed and took the shovel without apparent effort he began to sling the muck over his shoulder with a rhythm matching that of the negroes again the tractors roared and spun their wheels and again they sank deeper into the mud mr mcculloch surveyed the situation for a moment by now my embarrassment was approaching fear willie bob he said finally we dont seem to be getting anywhere in a hurry go over on the hill there where theyre baling and get that big m tractor hurry now its getting late turning back to me he said now professor you dont have to worry ive got thirteen tractors on this plantation and if it takes them all well get you out now i expect your wife is upset too you go over there and tell her that we can handle it within minutes three more men came driving up on the biggest tractor id ever seen directly behind them came willie bob in his truck as the third tractor was being backed into position i could see henrys truck coming down off the levee there was a white man in the cab beside him the white man got out of the truck and came toward us on the run his face was very red and it was easy to see that he was angry the negroes fell back and let him pass he ignored me completely and strode over to where mr mcculloch was having the third tractor hitched to the second which was mired in the mud the planter seemed surprised to see him well he said casually i didnt want to bother you but were having a little trouble here mr wheeler the manager turned completely around and looked directly at me it looks like it he said in a highpitched nasal drawl a little trouble three tractors so far two trucks and a dozen hands that shore is a little trouble he spat in the mud without further ado wheeler began to shout orders at his men he had them take a small log and bind it lengthwise across the rear wheels of the second tractor then he himself mounted the machine and directed henry to pull with the big tractor hitched in front the motors roared alive now however instead of the wheels of the mired tractor spinning in the mud as before as soon as the log bound across them struck the ground the wheels were raised completely out of the muck and up to the surface of the road it was then a simple matter to fill up the tire ruts with rocks and drive the tractor out under its own power the same technique was applied to the tractor which first became mired and in less than ten minutes both were on their way back to the fields wheeler then tied both lengths of chain together and fastened the free ends to the big tractor and to my car the greater length of chain enabled the tractor to operate on comparatively solid ground and get better traction i got in the car to steer it in spite of the fact that there was a good possibility that it would topple over into the bayou as soon as it began to move the big tractor crept forward the chain grew taut and the car was dragged along the edge of the bayou until it finally moved wholly upon the bank as soon as i had the car in the road again the plantation boss re moved the chains threw them into the truck and drove away after directing his men to return to work immediately i felt frustrated because i had no opportunity to thank the man for his help in what had seemed an increasingly hopeless situation turning to mr mcculloch i tried again to apologize for trespassing and for the three tractors two trucks and a dozen hands who were tied up in trying to get me out of the bayou when they should have been harvesting hay somehow i felt that to offer a check in an attempt to pay for his kindness would have been insulting his next words proved me right son he said tractors and trucks are not the important issues in the world neither is hay some men would disagree with me and there are some who havent given much thought to it but human beings like you and me and your children over thereand what we can do for each otherthis is what matters now why dont you go on in there and catch some fish and i wish i had time to show you where theyre hitting with that he climbed into the truck with willie bob and drove off over the levee on that same day not too many miles away in the same state a jury of citizens freed two men accused of murdering a fifteen year old negro boy for wolf whistling at a white woman
