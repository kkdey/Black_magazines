a voice crying in the south african wilderness by peter ritner four african lawyers who happened to be christian founded the african national congress in 1912 at that time of course the south african government was still paternally guided by the imperial parliament in london therefore an appeal to the consciences of the coalition of englishspeakers and moderate afrikaners who ran the country on the spot but which was utlimately responsible to an enlightened upper class in england seemed to promise the best chance of success the principle of operation was publicity vividly present the africans plight to these europeans the theory ranmake them feel in their bones the misery of the african and their best instincts will take over and right the perennial wrongs such a campaign of publicity has continued to be the main principle of congress operations but the audience which was meant to profit by it has sadly deteriorated the imperial parliament has vanished with the kingdom of 4 hanover the englishspeakers in south africa have quite lost their victorian religion without having lost the taste for creature comforts and the publicity which the congress has in mind is thrown away on the afrikaner he already knows everything about the plight of the african for he created it today the presidentgeneral of the african national congress is an extremely captivating and nobleminded man chief albert luthuli the only african who is a true national figure in the country the chief is an individual of subtle nuance of personality he is one of those rare beings who commands a spiritual alchemy which changes peace and brotherhood into concepts that seem to be as exciting as war and servitude now in his seventies stricken with heart disease the chief is writing the epilogue of a lifetime spent in trying to rouse the european to see the reasonableness of our case long ago when the northern africa for the africans leaders were still in their cradles before they had become presidents and prime ministers the chief was already a leader of his people he has failed to lead them to a land of milk and honey but this is a failure he has never conceded and at the same time he has never modified the modesty and the finality of his political aims full participation of the african in the government and control of their future he is undoubtedly the only african politician on the continent who would deny himself the pleasure of devouring the afrikaner alive for he is a christian and a noble who lives up to all his faiths at once but naturally he neither expects nor receives any gratitude from the afrikaners they have deposed him however his people and the new chief connive at flouting this deposition arrested him persecuted him insulted him and beaten him in his lifetime the chiefs position as spokesman for the congress and for the urban africans of south africa will never be challenged but the chief himself is the first to admit that the working leadership of the movement the secretariat in johannesburg has been forced by the outrageous bellicosity of afrikanerdom to veer far to the left of the traditional congress standthe stand to which the chief is personally committed men can be chewed up just so much and the chief has little enough to show for thirty negro digest december 1961 years of waiting around for european reasonableness to assert itself if the congress means to capture the loyalties of younger africans which of course it must do if it intends to remain effective it must meet on new ground the new poles of african events the diehardism in south africa and the new freedom in northern africa but inevitable innovations in programing have not reduced the chief to a figurehead he is too wise to begrudge the younger generation its right to chart a new path and in his heart he suspects i would guess that as a younger man facing the apartheid of the midcentury he too would bend his convictions so he has not simply retired from the fray but has used his prestige to construct for himself something like the constitutional position of the british queen he reminds and warns the officials and young warhawks of his party of the realities of life when their zeal seems to be overpowering their good sense specifically he tells his subordinates that the congress is not yet powerful enough for a big move organization on the reserves and the farms hardly exists at all and even in the cities party discipline is rudimentary when a chord in the africans soul is plucked in just the right way he is capable of a stubbornness and solidarity that are sensational such a phenomenon could be seen operating at the time of the johannesburg bus boycott of 1957 but this boycott was not a nationwide thing and it was more a spontaneous outburst than a congress offensive whether it is to be party or conspiracy the congress has far to go before it has honed itself into a true political instrument when the chief tires of reminding his collaborators that they must make themselves into a political party before they can hope to achieve the aims of a political club he turns to his second theme and that is that when and if blood begins to flow in south africa most of it will spill from black bodies not white ones the european is outnumbered four to one in south africa this is a sizable gap but not sizable enough so that the africans can deal with their enemies by drowning them in spit as gandhi once threatened to drown the english in india behind the afrikaners seemingly suicidal policy of leaving the african no alternative but violence there is a countervailing afrikaner readiness even eagerness to commit violence on the african to wind up the whole tortuous business to a climax the afrikaner youth is armed and drilled from the time he enters adolescence and trained in local militias the afrikaner government possesses jet planes and tanks and phosphorus bombs and the other impedimenta of modern 6 war and the afrikaner is sick of the african sick of his own vitalseating sickness he is sick of the shroud of melancholy and guilt which the thousands of africans of his day to day experience are wrapping around his soul he is sick of accusing rags and protruding ribs sick of the unconquerable presumption of men who ought not to think of themselves as men but in falling a victim to this fearful and reckless belligerence the afrikaner is summoning up out of the depths of african personality a complementary yearning for the consummation of violence doordieism increasingly will be the byword of young africans a historical horror is being compounded right before the old chiefs eyes and i suspect that the disastrous courses of the past decade have finally throttled all his hopes and optimism that it can be avoided but chief luthuli will go to his death preaching against a racial war of extermination and to the end he will conceive it to be his minimum duty to his people to warn them of the high blood price of freedom government regards him as the strongest and most dangerous thorn in its side like prime minister verwoerd luthuli was a college teacher before he turned to politics teaching at a small missionrun college for the bantu in 1936 he left the quiet academic life for the more turbulent world of politics when his tribe elected him to be chief of its small reserve of 5000 people chief luthulis duties combined those of administrator lawgiver and father confessor he would as he recalls sit under a shady tree and decide everything from questions regarding the dowry of a bride to marketing the tribes sugar cane crop most efficiently in the 1940s luthuli became active in the swelling bantu campaign to lower south africas color bars later as an official of the african national congress the chief bantu political organization he toured south africa urging nonviolent resistance to apartheid the nationalist government tried to curb luthulis growing influence first it dismissed him from his position as chief the bantu retaliated by electing him president of the african national congress the government struck back by banning luthuli from all large cities for a year later it confined him to his native village for two years shortly after this ban was up luthuli was arrested for treason for taking part in campaigns against existing laws before his case came to trial however the charges were dropped since last may the government has kept him confined to his home province of natal luthulis aides say he still believes that the best way to get results is through nonviolent resistance and through roundtable negotiations what colonialism did to africa by sekou toure he african problem is both simple and complex and many nations groups and parties are facing the kind of new problems with which guinea is now faced africa is a geographical and a human entity but both morally and spiritually it is more diverse than any other it is therefore essential to discuss the problems that have to be solved in that context it is impossible for me either in writing or in lectures to present these problems objectively but it is possible to present a context though it will necessarily contribute an incomplete image of my country a country that some of you probably knew before i was born the essential factor that i want to bring out is the extent to which we in africa are conditioned by our way of life our country is backward and has gone through three distinct stages first there was the stage of precolonization in which our organization was communal each group had its own customs its own concepts of economic organization its own philosophy it had its own sketchy form of civilization but the important thing is that this civilization was our own like other parts of the world our countries knew insecurity and famine and went through the kind of struggle which is common to the whole human race to satisfy their material and moral needs people had to use what means they found at hand they had few contacts with the outside world in the second stage with the arrival of outsiders these contacts were established at first they were economic then social cultural and political during this period our original way of life was interrupted and modified by our contact with other civilizations sometimes the evolution characteristic of the first stage was arrested sometimes it became more dynamic in any case life was changed above all it was diverted from its normal course in my grandparents time ethnic language and tribal divisions gave way to divisions on a territorial basis african lands became colonies whose frontiers no longer respected the natural divisions which though not watertight had formerlywhether for instance in senegal in sudan or in guineahad a real existence these countries are inhabited by the same races and have the same civilization their essential characteristics are those of the entire african continent but the colonizers had their own methods the first change that they made the modification of frontiers was a negative contribution the second the linking of the african economy to the world economy was more dynamic it brought many changes it helped to increase markets and provided more social opportunities yet social development could not progress very far because the natural basis the popular basis was lacking the new social organization also created new problems education brought us into contact with new cultures a certain number of us assimilated the civilization of other countries and the result was that africa became culturally divided may i quote a personal example i find myself more at home with french friends than with my own elder brother who has never been to school colonization meant that opportunities of advancement were open to a small african elite but the cost was the creation of deep divisions between us materially there was progress but the happiness of man does not come merely from material things it comes from the harmonious development of material and spiritual elements the risk was that a moral vacuum would be created that we should become declasses educated but at home nowhere this is the negative contribution of colonialism evolution which in the precolonial era was vertical now became horizontal the different areas of africa evolved inharmoniously along different lines it was a period of unification military administrative and cultural unification when laws were applied throughout a whole territory the result was to create a positive sense of belonging to a larger community than that of the family or the tribe but it also had the negative result that the unified system was illadapted to meet the real diversity of needs there was a consequent distortion during this phase individual africans benefited from new possibilities of evolution at first they welcomed assimilation because education revealed new horizons but these horizons were always receding the original aim was to achieve equality between rulers and ruled but too often africans found say when elected to the assembly that their problems were as far as ever from a solution another phase followed during which trade unions students associations exservicemens organizations cultural organizations and political parties were formed they constituted an affirmation of the african personality this is not a complete picture but it is a picture of something that we feel deeply even if we cannot always express these feelings articulately there followed a third stage in which we realized that individual expressions of our personality were not enough we had to find collective forms of association because as individuals we could not achieve our objective which was the expression of the african personality this stage is the most important but the most difficult to describe africans believe that the dynamic period of colonialism gave africa a positive means of action our struggle for independence is not negative we want to retain the positive contribution of colonialism the increased contacts and the increased possibilities of exchange that it brought but we want to eliminate its negative aspects africa has we believe potentialities for economic expansion and we believe that independence will be a factor making for stabilization we do not believe that independence will bring a paradise on earth we are conscious of our need to unite and independence is for us a means to that end we are realists we want to increase our understanding of and our cooperation with other peoples to liquidate the disequilibrium that has been created in africa man as a human being must fulfil himself if we cannot create the necessary conditions for ourselves we must create them for those who will come after us this is the real moving force of african nationalism you can afford to oppose nationalism because you have gone through this stage we have not that is the tragedy of our situation what we want is to have laws that are the expression of our own people and this they have not always been an imposed system however good it may be is never valued as much as one that one has created for oneself what is lacking is human dignity of course we in guinea have our problems our country includes many tribes speaking some twenty different languages this is a problem which has to be tackled it is no good shutting ones eyes to the fact of our internal divisions it is better to tackle them head on we must organize the country at first there has naturally been opposition but in two or three or five years our people will have forgotten this we want to be responsible for our own lives one can always give ones brother good advice but he may prefer to make his own mistakes that is the african psychology and it is another reason why we are nationalists whatever people may say nationalism is psychologically inevitable and we are all nationalists what we africans are seeking is justice and equality let me give you an example of what i mean an employer may decide to pay a wage of 1000 francs even though he knows that the minimum wage is only 500 francs everybody will be happy at getting double the rate but if there is inequality between one worker and another the whole relationship within the group will be affected this is a human problem that the employer does not understand he sees only that he is paying double rates but what the african is interested in is equality at the present time we are also seeking liberty because it is a moral force we want to say what we please but improperly used this liberty can be dangerous we must be sure that we are facing the facts however disagreeable they may be if problems are not properly presented then things will go badly because we shall not have the conviction to overcome our problems on the whole we have the same aims we all believe in trade unionism but we have all understood that trade union action alone is not enough we must use it as a political as well as an economic weapon these are two facets of what is really the same purpose the first problem we have to tackle is the general one of organizing unified political action through trade unions particular problems can come later formerly we were divided some of us were in unions affiliated to the wftu some in christian unions some in those affiliated to the icftu i was myself a member of the cgt which was affiliated to the wftu but we wanted a united african movement taking no account of racial differences a movement whose primary aim would be the achievement of independence and whose secondary objective would be the safeguarding of the interests of the workers you will note that i put the political aim first and that we are seeking to achieve it through the trade unions that is an expression of our psychology at the present time all our trade unions are now political and all are working for independencein togoland and throughout the former territories of west and equatorial africa we also include some trade unions from british territories which were formerly affiliated to the icftu but which at the last conference of the union generate du travail dafrique noire decided in principle to join us a trade union leader from ghana has been made vicepresident some moroccan and tunisian trade unions also decided at conakry on union with us we do not want this to be a negative organization we want to make a positive contribution towards the development of our countries and we realize that ideological quarrels will not help we must have a concrete programme and fight for it actively we have drawn up our programme in cooperation with trade unions throughout the world we exclude none any trade union is free to send representatives to guinea to discuss our problems with us and if they can help us so much the better at present europe is busy setting up the common market and is anxious to include africa in it we say no we constitute at present too small a market we must first increase our own free market we have nothing against anyone but we prefer freely negotiated agreements and we think it is more honest to say so we are underpopulated and economically backward it is better for us to exploit what we have and to cooperate with anyone who will work with us there are various ways in which we can serve the cause of liberty the most important is in our own country independence is a means to an end and that end is security if we fail to work for that we betray the cause of liberty we are responsible to those for whom we work our aim must be the welfare of our population at the time the loicadre was voted ie 1956 we already used it differently from other territories we sought to create a new mentality if we voted no ie in the 1958 constitutional referendum the reason was precisely that we had developed a new outlook that we had confidence in our own future here are some examples of what we have done since we became independent first we have got rid of antiquated customs in our villages the tribal chiefs were exploiting them for their own ends and so they had ceased to fufil any useful function people were no longer free what we have done is to appeal to the people themselves as against the chief we instituted elected councils and so transformed the village a third of the seats on village councils are reserved for women and many villages have women mayors second we have set up district councils elected by universal suffrage all who are over 21 have the right to vote a district normally includes from 200 to 300 villages peasants are allotted six seats in every ten so that on a council with 40 seats 24 will go to the peasants the educated have no advantage over the uneducated before independence there were twelve parties in guinea today there is a national front a single party the guinea democratic party those who say that i am a dictator because we have only one party and no opposition do not understand what we are trying to do the party is not an end but a means towards the end which is human freedom at first there was a great deal of disagreement and there was criticism too from outside people said the system would not work but it does and it works democratically in the village all are equal and the majority decides and this has created confidence intellectuals have no privileges all problems are discussed so that everybody can learn to feel that he belongs to the one nation that guinea belongs to us all if you think that this is a dictatorship come and see for yourselves there have been no political trials since independence there is opposition but it is expressed within the party and not from outside this is a different approach because our peasants and workers are practical people who are interested above all in concrete problems we do not discuss marxism but whether to build a bridge or a school and whether to build it here or there one thing we have achieved in guinea is personal security i can quote you one example of this a frenchman i know told me that he felt safer in guinea than he did in certain districts of paris one of our problems is economic development investment is encouraged and our method has been to call a congress of all our organizations throughout guinea and to explain to the delegates exactly what the new plans are and what the consequences would be we explained that at first some 5000 workers would be needed for the new projects but that later on all but about 400 would become redundant and that there was a danger of inflation the result was that when we signed the agreement we all knew what to expect and so nobody could blame us afterwards when the expected consequences materialized at this point m sekou toure interrupted his address in order to provide time for questions among the questions asked were the following qwhat would be the consequences if an opposition were to decide that it wanted to have a separate existence outside the party m sekou toure there is perfect freedom under our constitution for opposition parties to exist but at the last election 91 per cent of the population voted for the guinea democratic party the opposition mustered only 56 per cent of the votes and finally decided to rejoin our party there was reconciliation and two of their leaders were given responsible posts in fact the opposition viewpoint can be much more effectively put from within the party than from outside we are not all agreed inside the party but we express our opinions honestly and in good faith qwhat are the relations of guinea with the cote divoire with ghana and with other african states m sekou toure our relations with ghana are intimate we have had a number of contacts and we shall have further meetings at which decisions will be taken with the cote divoire we have no official relations between our two governments but relations between our peoples are friendly we are also on good terms with other african states qwhat are your own chief resources and what are your chief needs from abroad m sekou toure in a year we have reduced personal taxes by half but national union has enabled us to do far more in the past year than we could have done if we had remained divided each village constitutes an independent sector responsible for taking its own decisions it has its own programme necessarily modest the village decides whether to build a school or a dispensary and so on this imposes no charge on the national budget because our resources are human the work is completed in two to three months in this way we have constructed 8000 kilometres of roads and built 500 schools hundreds of dispensaries and a number of bridges if the village decides to build a road which involves the destruction of somebodys property that property is always rebuilt by the village if there is a fireand that can easily happen as our houses are of strawthe whole village cooperates in the reconstruction our chief capital is human the strange musical genius of blind tom by walter monfried f iftythree years have passed since the death of that most astounding and mysterious of musical prodigies known as blind toma babbling imbecile who could play the piano like an angel upon hearing of toms demise the famous louisville editor marse henry watterson observed i must be his oldest living friend i cannot trust myself to write of him as i feel it is as if some trusty well loved mastiff mute but affectionatehad been taken away what was he whence came he blind deformed black the idiocy of a perpetual frenzy was the sole companion of his waking visions that there was a soul there be sure imprisoned chained in that little black bosom released at last blind tom refuses to be forgotten he bobs up again and again in the public prints this month he receives another high honor he is included in a new supplement to groves dictionary of music and musicians the outstanding encyclopedia of its kind in english the entry begins bethune thomas greene born muscogee county georgia usa may 25 1849 died hoboken n j june 13 1908 american negro musical prodigy known as blind tom how good a player was tom at 17 he moved a baltimore journalist john law to declare i may say without the slightest exaggeration that toms execution of all kinds of musicfrom the classical works of beethoven bach mendelssohn and others down to the simplest plantation melodyis unsurpassed by that of the best performers of the day he was still only 17 when on a european tour he was heard by the celebrated pedagogues ignaz 16 moscheles of vienna and prof h s oakley of edinburgh they called him a wonder of nature all discriminating reviewers agreed that tom had marvelous facility and memory but that he lacked originality of interpretation he could reproduce only what he had heard one may speculate on what he would have done in a phonographic age with gieseking and horowitz for models tom was the 21st child of his mother a slave his parents were unlettered field hands but surely with music in their souls when he was a babe in arms his mother went upon the block and was sold to gen thomas greene bethune owner of a plantation near columbus ga the child was thrown in for nothing because he was sightless and of low mentality from infancy he revealed an overpowering passion for music at the age of 2 he would creep up on the bethune porch and listen to the girls singing inside even then he was a remarkable mimic he could sing whatever he had heard and in the manner of the singer high or low male or female when tom was 4 the bethunes acquired a piano tom was playing near the house spinning about on his hands and heels a lifetime recreation of his when he first heard the strange new sounds he was entranced he hid in the bushes around the porch and stayed there until the girls left the piano room then he stole in found the keyboard and duplicated the sounds he had heard tom always roamed by night he would sneak out of his mothers cabin and wander for hours when he returned he would emulate vocally the noises of storms rustling leaves cattle and so on at other times he would steal into the bethune parlor at midnight and play the piano until dawn the bethunes immediately recognized his gift and encouraged it the oldest daughter a fairly good pianist started to teach him but soon discovered that he could do everything she knew and much better then gen bethune engaged the communitys best players and teachers to work with the boy and again tom showed he could duplicate anything he had heard when tom was 8 his owner took him on tour at louisville he was heard by a showman william henry palmer an excellent pianist who also was a professional magician under the name of heller palmer realized that here was a first rate attraction he began to enlarge toms repertory he played many pieces for him and tom played them back more expertly than his mentor and what tom learned he never forgot henry watterson was a 19 year old reporter when he first heard tom then aged 10 watterson himself was a pianist of talent but a hand injury and partial blindness ended his keyboard studies he remained a lifelong lover of music at first hearing watterson was dumfounded by toms abilities and eccentricities and he never ceased to marvel at them in his memoirs written many years later he recalled tom had heard stephen douglas speak in congress and he could repeat many of the sentences after he heard a soprano he repeated her songs a tennessee baritone taught him rocked in the cradle of the deep a tenor in griffin ga taught him some love songs tom could duplicate all of them his imitations from bass to soprano were startlingly lifelike he was blind and clearly an idiot in short he was a prodigy when another pianist was playing tom would spin about like a baboon as watterson put it when his turn came he pounced upon the instrument and tried to play what he had heard two or three lessons were enough for him to learn a short piece tom had unusual powers of improvisation too after the civil war tom chose to remain with the bethunes who always were kind to him in his 40 year concert career under their direction he earned 200000 about 5000 a year when the costs of travel lessons and escorts are considered it is obvious that no one profited heavily on his prowess toms vaudeville act was truly unusual he sang in several registers in addition to playing the piano as a windup he stood with his back to the keyboard played a hornpipe with one hand and with the other he pounded out patriotic airs on the piano then members of the audience were invited to the stage and asked to play anything several would respond and offer little numbers tom emulated readily in philadelphia when tom was 37 the invitation to the audience was accepted by anna amalie tutein a concert pianist and teacher she played a difficult excerpt from a beethoven concerto and tom was stumped the bethunes realized that tom had a lot to learn and hired mme tutein to instruct him at 5 a lessona sizable fee in the 1880s it was a distasteful task mme tutein recalled long afterward tom had grown fat he literally ate like a hog and he fought fiercely against being washed and bathed i must dispel the idea that tom could repeat anything after having heard it once she related the lessons were two hours long and it was often necessary for me to play the compositions 50 times before he would acquire them i would feed him 8 or 10 measures at a time then he would play them over several times and we would go on with others after he had a fair impression of the piece i would play it in entirety and he would listen intently in this way tom memorized many of the difficult works of beethoven liszt chopin men18 delssohn and other masters he was not a complete automaton he could ask a fairly intelligible question such as whether a note was a fourth or an eighth he knew the names of each pitch a b c etc and he had the gift of absolute pitch the instructor could not carry on a conversation with him however when he replied yes to a question she knew he did not understand when he really did understand he hissed and quivered nor was his playing completely mechanical he did more than mirror the playing of others his teacher revealed he could put expression and individuality into his performance he had a sturdy elastic technique and great accuracy toms custody which became an issue in the courts eventually passed to mrs albert t lerche the widow of a son of gen bethune in his last years he made his home in her hoboken apartment and toured in vaudeville at 59 he suffered a stroke which left one arm useless and the other impaired he stumbled to the piano tried to play and managed only a few discords tom cant play no mo he muttered as he wept a few days later he was at the piano again singing softly then he sobbed ise all done missus and fell to the floor dead second class soldiers by rabbi paul h levenson now see here chaplain the deputy post commander scowled all this running around and poking your nose into things you have no business to is only going to get you into trouble he swung around in his chair and smiled wryly at me this was the third time id been invited into the generals office because of my activity on behalf of negro soldiers the colonel his deputy knew me well enough by now to smile why dont you publish all this in your memoirs when you get out of service he suggested for heavens sake dont print anything now his plea was an order and i had to accept it since i was only a chaplain 1st lt but i remembered his facetious suggestion and took it seriously i swore then and there to tell the story of how the negro soldier still suffers from the insanity of segregation in spite of the fact that the army proudly proclaims itself integrated its the story also of a handful of brave people who tried to right the wrongs committed against a sizeable number of our nations soldiers first the setting by far the largest number of permanent army bases are located in the south the liberal clergyman who lives down south by choice knows he must lock horns with strongly conservative elements who have psychological and often monetary investments in the maintenance of the segregated status quo he has to deal with them bargain cajole appeal to their consciences cry out 20 in the name of god all for the purpose of trying to allow a fellow human being to buy a tuna fish sandwich and a cup of coffee at a local drugstore the bigger issues of segregated schools housing and transportation will be decided by the courts meanwhile the liberal clergyman tries to create a climate of opinion favorable to the cause of civil_rights the liberal clergyman in the army who wants to back up his pulpit convictions with actions discovers that even in peacetime commanding generals object strongly to activists whom he thinks are rocking the militarycivilian goodwill boat within the limits of the southern army base everything is integrated on post housing is given to qualified soldiers on a firstcomefirstserve basis cafeterias post exchanges the racial composition of companies and battalions all are integrated even the town high schools are integrated because the government says they must or be turned down in their application for federal funds the army is integrated because it was ordered to do so about 10 years ago as a social experiment it can be termed an unqualified success despite individual experiences of overt or covert discrimination some men dont like it but they take it because they know there is no choice civilians who work on the particular southern army base at lege in florida while i paid for it by being in the army she graduated in june but cant get a job here in this town as a high school physics teacher thats what shes trained for actually she would take any teaching job at all the colored grammar school has enough teachers and the other ones in town would never hire her several of my friends wives taught in the town school system because many army wives teach there is an extraordinary turnover when their husbands are shipped out the schools need steady teachers so badly that a bonus of 30000 is given to any teacher who stays on one full year the negro soldier went on to explain that his wife could get no job at all in town not even as a department store counter girl which pays 500 an hour for an 8 hour day without the extra income it would be difficult to pay the high rents in the negro housing district rents there are 2000 more than comparable homes in the main part of town this mans case is typical and no exaggeration discrimination in offduty hours employment is quite trying on negro soldiers families since they use the money to supplement their skimpy cash income while the u s soldiers pay is quite good the actual cash received is not sufficient for building up a reserve the government calculates that medical benefits for families are worth a considerable amount and they take this into ac22 count when estimating total income another unseen benefit is retirement pay this is in effect deducted from the monthly pay and reduces the cash payments proportionately because of these reasons and the natural one of wanting more money to save or spend many soldiers work a few nights each week or wives might work during the day in this way they earn an extra 15002000 each year in addition to their army pay a sum equal to onethird their entire cash income per year the negro soldier and his wife though just as qualified as their white counterparts have no equality of opportunity in obtaining this outside work in southern towns this causes great hardship to many families but the army says it cant interfere with the policies of the local community and shrugs an apology the unfairness of this and other discriminatory practices particularly in the area of housing puts the liberal to the test i asked myself as a jewish rabbi could i practice in the south what i had preached so securely in long island new york less than 4 months before and with the added burden of being in the army and subject to its restrictions i felt that the least i should do is try to contact others and organize something to alleviate these conditions so unfavorable to the negro their wives and little children to live there some negro soldiers prefer not to have their families living in red light and high crime areas the results are nothing short of tragic ive met many such men their wives cant get jobs they dont want their children to shift from wellequipped and well staffed schools in unsegregated areas to the usually run down schools with the poorly trained teachers of the negro segregated school some of these negro soldiers decide to live alone in barracks far from their loved ones such separations have a demoralizing effect on the men and their families the assignment in the states for at least 18 months is supposed to be favorable duty when a soldier goes to korea he cant take his family along anyone with less than five years in the army cant possibly afford to transport his family and household goods to europe to add to these long forced separations another 18 months if a negro is assigned to a southern base and the situation becomes very tense some of these men go for years without spending more than a 30 day leave at home with their wives and children every now and then they cant take them overseas with them and they have enough respect for them that they wont permit them to live in red light districts when assigned to a southern post 24 we interviewers found disturbing problems confronting those who decided to stay in the negro section of the town close to the base there were 80 fairly decent units built with the help of a federal housing administration loan adjacent to this development which was rapidly deteriorating because of lack of adequate repairs was a closely spaced trailer camp of a similar number of units another area across the main highway into town was literally a shanty town of slapped together boards and tin cans even there some sections were restricted the development located on the hill was about a mile outside of town two miles from the main shopping area and three miles from the camp itself the houses and the trailer camps were planted with little thought given to the intended occupants comforts or conveniences not a single store of any type was opened on the hill since the development was too small to support it buses refuse to negotiate the hill to pick up people mothers without cars must take a taxi into town and back for a bottle of milk repairs were rarely made inadequate fire hydrants were noted there was insufficient street lighting in comparison with other parts of town and roads were not oiled down to keep them from being washed away though the grammar school on the army base is integrated the grammar school on the hill is de facto segregated the high schools in town are integrated the only ones that are in a radius of hundreds of miles the reason for these exceptions is the requirement that federal aid to schools which are used by dependents of large numbers of government employees can be given only if the local school district integrates its schools though the local school board is strongly segregationist they just couldnt afford to be in this case the negro grammar school on the hill though brand new is staffed only with negro teachers these teachers though dedicated dont receive the training and education in their southern negro teachers colleges that caucasians do in their caucasian teachers colleges its worth while noting that the few white soldiers families who live on one part of the hill send their young children to the grammar school in town by public school bus the net result is that government funds are being used to support segregated schooling i spoke to those segregated souls on the hill at a sunday church service i had arranged for their minister to talk to the jewish group during brotherhood week the sermon i gave was an impassioned plea to the minister and the congregation to organize themselves as the jews of america had done and fight discrimination with the strength of man they could appeal to the religious feelings of their fellow christians an avenue of approach that had borne results in other cities the sermon was received politely to their surprise i returned the love offering to their mission fund of the church and never heard a word from them thereafter plainly these people were unable to work for themselves they were sufficiently cowed that they would not raise a voice of protest even though they knew the truth of what i had said word of everything the committee members did was brought back to the commanding general by a spy an officer attached to division headquarters he gave us little sermons at our biweekly gettogethers about the dangers involved their illegality the fact that the general was aware of our existence and his strong disapproval the rest of us were resolved to continue though the danger of being expelled from the service for doing so became increasingly real the lone negro chaplain dropped out after the second meeting he had penned a hasty note to the commander of the wac garrison accusing her of keeping the wac barracks segregated this is what several girls had told him the commanding general was informed of the letter and had the chaplain on the carpet warning him to avoid all involvement with integrationist activity meanwhile i had invited the commanding general to my home he and his wife graciously attended despite his knowledge of my activities we spent much of the evening discussing the housing situation though the general finally cut it short with the unforgettable bellow i want you to remember sir the majority has rights too the final report was submitted to members of the committee who signed it included among them were 30 per cent of the forts 20 chaplains addressed to the commanding general it concluded the negro soldier although wishing to serve the army and his country to the best of his ability finds it difficult to do so under such adverse circumstances we hope that you will give this grave problem your prayerful consideration and we would respectfully suggest that the committee be formed to study this housing problem and if the above report is verified recommend to the city officials that they discuss with the owners of rental property the advisability of integrated housing in their comunities the report was never made officially when the general heard that it was about to be sent up to him he called the members of the committee into his office and warned them not to send it he had seen it unofficially and disapproved of it notices were printed in the daily bulletin reemphasizing a regulation prohibiting all unauthorized organizations which had to be approved by the command before they could be allowed to exist at the base our committee on housing ceased never to be revived officially or unofficially the episcopalian minister from town continued on in his work trying individual persuasion with town realtors but achieved very little i arranged material for him gathered from american jewish congress pamphlets on the myth of negroes destroying property values otherwise we had been silenced effectively the remedies for the illness of segregation in an army town must be stronger than a few foolhardy and idealistic soldiers and an occasional sermon by a chaplain about brotherhood publication of the facts such as these will help a sitin at a southern army base was reported by drew pearson in his syndicated column this past july this had them buzzing in the pentagon there are many high ranking officers who are decent people who want to see these insults to united states soldiers wiped out forever but they cannot act alone it will take public pressure lots of it to drive home to the men who have it within their power to change these conditions to do so as soon as possible have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother the day i discovered i was colored by louie robinson t he day of the great discovery had that special lemoncolored quality which seemed to me to come only to texas summers it was bright and fresh and offered boundless opportunities for baseball crawdading mumble peg stick horse or picking cars the latter was a game we played by lining up on the sidewalk taking turns from one through whatever number of us there were and any automobile that passed during your turn was yours in those days in my part of town the cars didnt come along too fast i left home early that morning after a breakfast of oatmeal with cornflakes a compromise menu since my grandmother had insisted i needed something hot for all the energy i burned up and i wanted the com flakes because they were the same kind all those baseball football and golf stars ate the system seemed pretty simple to me eat the corn flakes and grow up to be a champion but then what did the name bob feller mean to my grandmother anyway i beat it out of there fast that morning before somebody started some jazz or other about me making up my bed or dusting the living room furniture boy i hated dusting i hightailed it up the alley to the mulberry tree on second street to meet the guys puddin head shultz was already there whittling on a stick when i ran up boy i bet that guy got up earlier than anybody in the whole world whenever we went hiking or fishing or something real early puddin head was the one who came around and woke everybody up his talents pretty much ended there whatcha doin i asked him for openers man im whittlin me a stick he answered whatcha makin i asked i aint makin nothin he said im whittlin me a stick it was a good conversation but i decided not to overdo it 28 i sat around silently watching puddin head for a few minutes until stinky higgins came along stinky was our cultural leader not only because at nine he was a couple of years older than most of the rest of us but he could also lick any kid in the block besides he was the only one in the bunch who knew how to cuss puddin head quit whittling his stick long enough to look up and yell hi stinky showing the kind of respect that a leader deserves hey stinky puddin heads whittlin him a stick i said figuring id bring him up to date on the mornings activities as quickly as possible hi puddin head stinky said with a grin then he looked at me and didnt say anything and his grin quit whats your problem i asked in surprise he was just standing there looking at me kind of funny and i figured maybe he wanted to fight or something it was okay with me but i couldnt see much point in fighting that early in the morning when there wasnt even anybody around yet but puddin head i couldnt whip stinky but at least the crowd always pulled for me in a fight because i was only seven and smaller than most of the other guys besides i won a lot of fights while i was standing there trying to decide whether i should just go on and sock stinky one first and then take my chances he said suddenly youre a damned spook aint cha a what puddin head asked looking up like i said in the world of semantics stinky was light years ahead of the rest of us he was still looking at me waiting for my answer i dont know i said you mean like a ghost or somethin naw i mean a spookspook stinky said look at cha youre black i looked at me im not black im brown i said black brown high yellowa spooks a spook stinky persisted who told you that puddin head wanted to know my old man stinky said he came home sober last night did your old man really come home sober puddin head asked yeah stinky said sitting down on the ground under the tree with us we thought he was sick or something anyway he told us all about colored people whats colored people i asked him youre colored people stinky said didnt your folks ever tell you not that i remember i said whats there to tell well stinky answered things like how you people can all sing and dance and stuff like that but youre not much good at readin and writin and figurin what the heck i said i negro digest december 1961 showed you how to read and write way last year my grandfather had taught me when i was four well we dont have any colored kids in our school cause theyre too dumb to keep up with us stinky scooped up a handful of mulberries off the ground and bit into them and the dark red juice squirted down the side of his mouth he wiped it away with his shirtsleeve besides he continued spooks aint very clean man my grandmother makes me bathe twice a week i protested we bathe at our house on saturday nights puddin head said every saturday night stinky asked most every saturday night puddin head said hygiene wasnt one of our favorite subjects so we soon got back to the heart of the conversation my old man says that hell if you go out of town on a damned bus or something stinky continued showing his mastery of profanity they make all the colored people ride in the back of it the hell you say i cut in i didnt know how to cuss and i had never ridden a bus but i figured that if when i did get on one i was going to have to ride in the back of it now was as good a time to start cussing as any where would i ride puddin head asked aint you listenin stinky demanded wed ride up front i was beginning not to like this at all so i decided to change the subject lets go swimmin i suggested my mother says shell whale the daylights out of me if she catches me goin swimmin again puddin head said lets race down to the fire plug it wont do any good stinky said matteroffactly whatcha mean it wont do any good puddin head said loudly you sure are talkin nutty today it just wont do any good for us to race down to the fire plug thats all stinky answered patientlv looies a spook aint he hell win they can all run faster than we can its somethin they got in their heels how come the last time we raced down to the fire plug i beat him a mile puddin head demanded are you callin my old man a damned liar stinky said hotly look maybe your old man just said all that because he was sober puddin head said he probably wont even remember it anymore besides if you dont like looie how come you live right across the street from him my old man says thats the difference in down south and livin up north down here we have houses together a lot but up north all the colored people live in one section of town what for puddin head asked 30 stinky ignored him but said to me and another thing stay away from my sister your sister i exploded boy i wish youd keep your dumb sister from over at my house playin with my fire engines and stuff leavin her dolls all over the place who wants to be bothered with your dumb sister boy that really burned me up his crummy sister was one big pain in the neck the only nice thing i could say about her was that she was still straight and hard like a boy and hadnt started getting all soft and lumpy like some of the older girls just thinking about girls made me so mad i had to crawl up in the mulberry tree to cool off while i was up there i decided i might as well do something useful so i picked all the berries i could stuff in my pockets without them bursting and staining my clothes and then i climbed back down the tree lets eat some berries i said pulling out a couple of hands full you gonna eat right here with us puddin head asked like he was suddenly getting the message where the hell you think im gonna eat in back of the tree i demanded i handed stinky his berries first in deference to his leadership then i handed some to puddin head and sat down on the ground with them and we ate tomorrow stinky said leaning back against the tree weve juot got to get segregated the bonus boy of boxing by lew eskin s ince boxing became part of the olympic games in 1904 five boxers who gained olympic championships have won world championships as professionals frankie genaro fidel labarba and pascual perez among the flyweights jackie fields among the welterweights and floyd patterson present heavyweight champion the wee ones competed as flyweights in the international games while fields won the featherweight title and patterson the middleweight crown only one other olympic champion ever even gained a shot at a world championship that boxer of course was pete rademacher who won the heavyweight title in 1956 at melbourne and who in his first professional bout clashed with floyd patterson after having floyd on the floor pete was knocked out in the sixth round out of last years games in rome there are two young men who have made rapid strides since turning pro both are competing as heavyweights francisco depiccoli of italy who won the olympic heavyweight title has run off a string of nine straight wins seven of them by knockouts since he made his debut last december and cassius clay of louisville ky who gained the light heavyweight title in rome also has a clean slate cassius who made his pro debut in his home town last october has moved up faster than has depiccoli in clays most recent bout he scored a triumph over experienced alonzo johnson in his national tv debut it was also his eighth straight victory with five of these coming via the knockout route clay who is nineteen has boasted that he will win the heavyweight title before his twentyfirst birthday while that is a difficult goal his background gives him a good chance to achieve his goal as an amateur he won top honors in every tournament he entered and compiled a record of over 100 wins against a mere eight losses with most of those defeats coming during his first year of boxing it was an odd accident that caused him to turn to boxing when he was twelve years old he attended a basketball game at columbia hall in louisville and when he left the place he discovered that his bicycle had been stolen he asked where he could find a policeman and was told that there was one in the gym going downstairs he found joe martin the boxing director of the police boys club conducting a class he tearfully told joe of his stolen bike and what we would do to the guy who took it martin called in a report on the theft then asked clay if he knew 32 how to fight no said cassius brushing away a tear well you ought to come around here and learn so that you can take care of that guy if you find him advised martin learn how to protect yourself cassius did come back and it was martin who turned him into one of the top amateur boxers of recent years cassius last year won both the national aau and golden gloves championships he boxed as a light heavyweight in the aau tourney and a heavyweight in the golden gloves due to the fact that under aau rules the weight limit is a 178 pounds against 175 in the golden gloves a strapping six foot two inch lad with a rapier like left jab cassius scaled 186 pounds for his first bout in which he won a six round decision over veteran tunney hunnsacker clay scaled 192 pounds for his last fight with alonzo johnson following the victory over hunsacker clay scored five knockouts in a row stepping up in class with each victory he halted herb siler in four tony esperti in three jim robinson in one and donnie fleeman in seven fleeman had previously kayoed former heavyweight champion ezzard charles and beaten willi besmanoff in clays next fight he kayoed lamar clark in two rounds then he outpointed big duke sabedong in ten in las vegas sabedong an experienced ringman who stands six feet six scaled 226 against 194 pounds for clay and proved a tough nut for the youngster although clay was unable to knock his man out he won easily against johnson another crafty boxer cassius showed signs of his lack of experience but his natural ability was more than enough to make up the difference and he again won although it was a unanimous verdict clay did not show the ability to make good his boast of winning the title within two years while he was in florida he worked as a sparring partner with ingemar johansson when the swede was training for his match with floyd patterson and clay impressed ingo and the press with his quick hands and footwork hes good this fellow johansson said after a sparring session he did a lot of jumping around and isnt a bit like patterson as he changes around too much i hope i can get him for more sparring as he sharpens me up others who have been impressed by the abilities of clay include ray robinson archie moore and the ring editor nat fleischer who saw him in all his rome olympic bouts cassius is the great great grandson of a slave who borrowed the name of his owner cassius marcellus clay who was the u s ambassador to russia and a relative of the famed henry clay the fighters father is also named cassius clay when he won the gold medal in rome clay was walking on a cloud i didnt take that medal off for two days said clay i even wore it to bed i didnt sleep too good because i had to sleep on my back so that the medal wouldnt cut me but i didnt care i was olympic champion he bought a bar and grill in louisville which was called the club havana but he changed the name to the club olympic his father is operating the place for him when he decided to become a professional clay signed a contract with a group of business men who set up a corporation to manage him this corporation paid him 10 000 for signing and he will receive 4000 a year for the next two years then if the options are exercised 6000 a year for the following four years he will also receive fifty percent of his ring purses plus training and travelling expenses on the rapid advance he has made in the ten months he has been a pro it looks like these who signed him were real sharp business men and that the olympic medal may not be the only gold that cassius will possess aside from liston machen and johnson clay feels he is ready for any of the others if he sticks to his timetable of winning the championship before 1963 he will have to step out by next summer right now he has shown that he has the ability to handle the top grade men but how he would do against the ranking fighters is something which has to be answered true the present crop of heavyweights is far from the best but they are a crew with plenty of experience no matter how he fares young

haiti for example in many respects the haitian and the american negro share the same cultural seed but of course haiti affords a more fertile soil for the cultivation of the african seed portauprince haitis capital is by no means a sleepy hollow remote entirely from noise and the bustle of the world its citizens while preserving a certain haitian simplicity in their manners and institutions have acquired a wide knowledge of other peoples from the tourist trade commercial and diplomatic relations then here too one will find the usual portable bootblacks cunning street venders and aspirant city slickers the streets are full of friendly people and their language culture and cuisine is french with african modifications i found haiti drenched in rum poetry music and art the rum is the best in the west indies the poetry is not bad the music is exciting and the art is primitive but we must leave all this city life for my unusual experience in haiti in the past several years haitian voodoo has acquired a notoriety which has prevented serious study of it most people have associated the term voodoo with zombies weird and sometimes orgiastic mysteries the tourist accepts the fake ceremonies staged for them and the haitian elite disclaims any knowledge of it but with the haitian peasant and the poor town folk it is a serious and sacred matter among the peasants survives a form of worship in which catholic and african cult practices are forged into one of the most discussed rituals in the western world my friend and guide marcel had learned that a special service was being held not too far from carrefour a town a little more than a half hours drive from the city of portauprince the ceremony was not to begin until late in the evening so i suggested to marcel that we stop by the casino before we drove to carrefour the casino is where many tourists go to try their luck at the wheel and many others go to view haiti through the bottom of a rum glass 36 i decided to take a taxi to the casino a hazardous ride it turned out to be the driver hurled into the midst of pedestrians and running children shouted and snarled insults in creole to all those who barred his path i held on to my seat for dear life after a few minutes of this i was virtually thrown out in front of the casino drenched with perspiration and fright weakly i went into my pockets to pay the daredevil there i was kept busy several minutes more while i searched through a roll of filthy wrinkled haitian banknotes and tormenting little coins before i drew out one gourde to pay the driver a gourde is about twenty cents in american money une table pour deux i addressed the waiter near our table i observed two american girls prowling like jaguars very soon they caught the attention of a haitian playboy and immediately they began pecking out high school french in huntandpeck fashion i later noticed a very dignified haitian gentleman weaving around the tables and singing pour le drapeau la patrie i recognized the tune as the first bars of the national anthem of haiti as he ended on maurir est beau he stood towering above my table and without the slightest provocation he addressed me pardon monsieur what will america do when castro takes over her base in cuba his real intent was of a subtle nature there was a moment of silence from all the tables nearby i merely stared at him my american ego was ruffled and i didnt know exactly the best thing to say at the critical moment it was marcel who came to my rescue he suggested we had better be going now you dont have much time for talk dear old marcel after we reached carrefour we still had about three miles to walk we had to climb a rough winding mountain path there were no available roads leading to the site of the service very soon the only neon sign on the main road in carrefour blinking hesitantly was left far behind we had only the moon and the stars to guide us we walked about a mile before i heard the faint beat of a drum in the far distance after stumbling over the rocky path that led up the mountainside a climb that seemed to have lasted for hours we finally came to the top of the mountain the drums were quite near now when we reached the hurriedly erected hut the service was already in progress a voodoo ceremony permits expression of the haitians most original art formssinging dancing and drumming traditional songs dances and drum beats are associated with the different types of worship service the ceremony itself has a definite form there is little opportunity for variation or testimony as practiced in many of the american rebel and splinter churches many of the ceremonies held in portauprince and its environs are faked for the tourists but a haitian drummer cannot fake he must play the threeman percussion battery this night were playing for a mange loa rite the feasting of the gods it is necessary to replenish occasionally the source of energy of the gods which is constantly drawn from them by their worshippers the most common offerings are chickens pigeons ducks goats and pigs a woman garbed in white wearing a tightly bound white cotton cloth around her head raised a banana leaf toward the sky she then oriented it that is she pointed it in the four cardinal directions as she turned to each point she chanted dieu le pere dieu le fils dieu le saint esprit et les myssteries in the name of the god the father of my spirits and my gods as she stood there erect and tense i was deeply moved by the sincerity of her poignant invocation the drummers had churned up a beady sweat and already their bodies were drenched in perspiration as i watched the strange cabalistic figures being drawn upon the ground instinctively and passionately my body began to sway i sat there swaying and trying hard to recall some strange familiar beat once lost in the recesses of my body i caught hold of myself for the moment and looked around for marcel i discovered him on the far side of the hut dancing in the circle of worshippers in a voodoo ceremony the bodies of the dancers never touch marcel caught my sharp gaze and i believe he gave me a rather encouraging nod to join in the service the drums were becoming louder now my head became dizzy and my body was hot again i thought once that i might faint au nom du pere et du fils et du saint esprit gan yin bon dieu in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost there is a god the chorus of women were singing now in the midst of this invocation a hellish shriek went up from a man rolling on the ground he had become possessed possession is a most important phenomenon in voodoo the behavior of the people when they are possessed has a theatrical quality when a god enters the head or mounts a person the others are entertained by his spiritual catalepsis the whole personality of a mounted person is changed during the state of possession he is then in a state to converse with the gods and even with deceased persons one cannot listen very long to haitian drums without being moved in some manner by their infectious rhythm i began to wonder if it were possible for me to become possessed i began swaying again 38 and i joined in the hand clapping the thin veneer of civilization was cracking it seemed as the insistent drums radioed their message my feet voluntarily began moving haiti was absorbing me possessed now i could feel the beat of the drums synchronizing with my heart beat and flowing in my blood africa was calling from the marrow of my bones and i was answering the prodigal son had returned the drums were urging the body to dance some strange suppressed metaphysical powers were demanding satisfaction the tempo of the drums increased the voodoo priest began to dance slowly at first the drums and the singing went on and on getting faster and wilder dominating the hearts and the feet of all the circle most of the worshippers were now trembling and shivering some had dropped to the ground and lay there as in a trance everyone seemed possessed by the frenzy of the drums the spirits of their ancestors were surely abroad tonight in complete surrender i found myself upon the floor my feet were following some strange step i suddenly became conscious that the drums had changed their beats and most of the dancers had left the circle and then a glassyeyed mambo a high priestess in voodoo hierarchy bounced into the room her body began to move like an angry snake and at otner times like an olympic star her hips undulated and rotated in accelerated rhythms and the violent jerks of her head threatened to dislocate her cervical vertebrae her serpentine movements sent writhing waves from her head to her feet then pandemonium broke out everyone was singing and jumping about wildly the whole hut was sent suddenly a most terrifying shriek shocked me back to my senses it was then that i noticed that marcel was standing by my side grinning and sweating profusely when my heartbeat had sufficiently slowed to render speech audible i turned to him lets get out of here i urged him i had just witnessed the first part of a most unusual ceremony also my first and last lesson in the catechism of island voodoo i had been baptised in its nocturnal rhythm as we dragged down the road into carrefour already the solid walls of the tropical heat was holding the early morning in her molten arms i raised my eyes and looked back over the hills bursting from their primitive shells the source of haitian comfort nowhere do men live closer to hills that sustain and embrace them please hurry and get a taxi i pleaded to marcel my feet are sore marcel looked at me proudly and repeated an old creole proverb apre das tabou toujou lou when the dance is over the drum is always heavy as i settled back in the taxi en route back to the city i thought i heard the faint beat of a drum and possibly i did drums will always play in haiti today as yesterday tomorrow and always in washington d c by haynes johnson negro at the lowest level of income and education feels cut off niy from socy but from many within his own race he is the true outsider in washington he believes that those in his race who hold good jobs and live in decent homes have turned their backs on him he and thousands like him comprise what is for want of a better termthe lower class of negroes that the negro has distinct classes with all of the accompanying friction and antagonism that the word implies should come as no surprise there are class structures in all groups within the negro population however the classes are particularly complicated there is a group within our racethey call themselves the educated group or the upper crust and they feel they are better than the rest of us a government worker said they actually build barriers within our own race what are these barriers one of the most important is also the most subtle it has to do with the word negro itself and what that word means youll meet many people in washington who will not use the word negro a distinguished negro educator said its a bad word so many painful memories are associated with it they might say colored but they might not even say that they almost try to deny such a race exists those scars are part of the experience of the negro some negroes will argue there are middle and upper class groups that are divorced from the problems of their race these people live in good homes insulated by their own small social groups they are not fighting for their race they are afraid of anything which might upset their status you see a young negro minister said when you reach the plateau of the middle class you dont want to rock the boat you dont want to disturb the situation especially once youre looked on as a socially desirable class until the middle and the upper classes realize that what happens to the lower classes affects them too no matter how much money or status they have you arent really going to be able to solve the problem from within theyre out of contact with the other groups he said they dont have to come home to one room and not know where the next meal is coming from they dont really feel these things and so they dont understand is this true negroes who have studied the problem say it is this reporter can only say he has been in some homes where it appears to be true in fairness though this has not been a common experience the negro intellectual is especially concerned about this problem he will say that often negroes who have risen to fivefigure incomesand there are many in this category in washingtonseem to wish to disassociate from the race they even will look down on negro folk music and literature a negro scholar says this reflects an attitude of second generation respectability i think its a weakness he said it tends to break down the connection between the educated and the lower groups bessie smith mahalia jackson people like that are honored in the community for their way of singing the people understand it its a part of their culture why should it be denied theres too much hypersensitivity about too many things a businessman said we are confronted with an entirely new type of opposition from a group which mistakenly identifies itself as the new negro he defined this kind of person as the selfefficient arrogant smug and underexposed individual who feels he has arrived his basic shortcoming lies in his desire to disassociate and his failure to share his knowledge with people of his own race who he feels are not up to standards that he now knows a negro sociologist tells about talking to a woman in this economic and social group who had watched louis armstrong on television the night before wasnt that terrible she said i said no why she said oh you know he doesnt look right she meant he was too black then i said i think hes an artist and we should be proud of him she still thought they should have got someone else at howard university one student has several charcoal sketches 42 of negroes on his dormitory wall they portray negro men and women with prominent negroid features you see those the student said pointing to the wall you know what many of the boys say when they see them they say oh those are terrible they mean theyre too negroid i keep them there as my private form of psychoanalysis for the others these attitudes still are factors in the colored classes in washington although their importance has diminished greatly in recent years thats what a colored man meant when he said the negroes in washington had to do their own integrating after 1954 at one time the shade of a mans skin played a significant role among the negro population in the capital this was a heritage from slavery days when the lightskinned negro was given advantages over the man with a darker skin i think today there is a little less emphasis on color among negroes a businessman who was born and educated in washington said but its hard to change the habit of years of tradition back in the old days the negro developed what im sure you heard of as a bastard aristocracy my own father was a mulatto for instance and lived in a certain class color became almost a caste both economically and socially to be a mulatto almost always identified you with a powerful white family those children had more opportunities they were sent away to school and formed their own societies in the northern cities usually they intermarried with each other to maintain the masquerade some of them were able to pass for whites it meant of course they had more advantages this is not so true today but it is true that many of the really old washington families actually resented integration to put it personally my mother was one of those shes rather stiffnecked about it who are these people in the better classes they are the same as in any group status is determined by money and education at the top are the professional groups the doctors lawyers teachers businessmen and highranking government employes in the middle is a large group of government workers merchants and ministers in many of these families the wife works and the husband has a second job so they can buy a home in a decent section at the bottom are the unskilled laborers i think your slum dwellers today are very sharply divided from your bourgeoisie a scholar said your professional groups have cliques there is your clash todaybetween the laborers and recent migrants from the south and the washington middle class expressing it another way its the old story that the lower classes are jealous and well they might be negroes will tell you with justifiable pride that this city has a better standard of living from the negro point of view than any other city in the united statesor in the world for that matter in the higher brackets the negro in washington may earn up to 100000 a year a negro businessman said for those who have been able to take advantage of the opportunities here the material rewards are visible the most striking is the neighborhood where the wealthiest negroes live in the far northwest off sixteenth street near the carter barron amphitheater and rock creek park this section is enviously called the gold coast certain sections seem to denote certain standards a colored man said for instance i live in brookbnd in northeast washington off rhode island avenue and they will say oh you live with the rich negro its the same way with the gold coast where the richest negroes live when the phrase gold coast was mentioned to a man who lives there he smiled and said yes i know that the other negroes call this the gold coast there are some who call this the negros spring valley well since this is the best area thats the reason we guard it just as jealously as they do in spring valley or wesley heights were not snobbish thats not it but look at it this way why put a big price on a home if youre going to allow the neighborhood to deteriorate no no one up here is snobbish although i guess there are negroes in other parts of town who think so a housewife on that street told how worried everyone was because a family who left southwest because of the redevelopment moved in next to the church on the corner and we are all quite upset about the appearance of the yard the man sits out on the porch in his overalls they are a more rural type of family not the way other people here are as you go down the economic ladder you will hear similar comments here are some certainly theres a difference among negroes its not snobbery but lets face it if a person isnt of the same background as you you dont even get anything out of a conversation with him you wouldnt choose that kind of person as a friend or marry that type ive sat down next to some of my people on the streetcar and frankly i dont relish it i guess we just consider ourselves better than others when you come down to that part of it im segregated myself there are some of em i wouldnt be caught walking the street with now i got to say itthere are some who just dont fit in with the people in washington youll find this in all races some they dont fix up like us we was both glad when the people next door moved they wasnt good neighbors were not all in the same class as one man said everyone knows there are second class negroes why i turned down stardom in paris by hermann gantt a series of suc2 cessful song recital appearances in holland last summer i accepted an invitation to spend two weeks at the villa of friends on the french riviera the evening of my return to paris i was confronted by a friend with a copy of a leading french newspaper le journal du dimanche and he called to my attention a large article regarding a search for a young negro frenchspeaking actor for a leading role in a new play by the popular french playwright marcel ayme the play supposedly dealt with racial problems in the united states the play was slated to open in exactly three weeks and the article gave every indication that the producers were desperately anxious for anyone with the abovementioned qualifications to apply for an audition my friend who is a french businessman and knows very little about show business assumed that since i had enjoyed some measure of success as a serious singer i should be able to act too after he had paid me that obviously kind compliment i gave out with a hearty chuckle and replied while ive had some dramatic training i do not profess to be an actor my dramatic studies were pursued only to enhance my stage presence and perhaps familiarize me with the stage in case of any operatic opportunities he continued to insist that i should audition for the part and as a means of terminating the subject as quickly as possible i jokingly agreed to do the audition if he would make all the necessary arrangements thinking he had received the message that i couldnt have been more disinterested i promptly began to tell him about the glorious vacation i had spent on the breathtakingly beautiful riviera i was so very wrong because he actually took me seriously and arranged for an audition after which he sent me an express note saying he had taken heed of my advice and had made all the arrangements i was positively flabbergasted to put it mildly realizing his genuine sincerity i knew i could not and would not fail to appear for that audition accompanied by him and another friend who was vacationing in paris from his native denmark i appeared at the theatre de la renaissance one of the most beautiful theatres in europe at the appointed hour 46 we were greeted by the producer the director and the author himself and to my great surprise they reacted as though they had found a longlost friend i thought that extremely odd since id never before seen either of them they immediately began to look at me from head to foot and silently but very busily nodding their approval ive had many auditions but never have i been exposed to such flattery then came the question have you had any acting experience i replied that i had had little or no acting experience on the legitimate stage but i had studied drama at the new england conservatory in boston while pursuing my vocal and repertory studies there their glowing faces changed slightly and the producer said quite apologetically you do understand that the role demands an actor who also has command of the french language i replied equally embarrassed yes i do and was all prepared to offer my apologies and excuse myself at that precise moment the producer perked up a bit and said but would you read for us anyway i frankly couldnt see the logic in it but i agreed a gesture was made for me to walk through a door onto the stage and i asked for a few minutes to review and study the scene they had suggested i read for them it later turned out to be the most difficult of all a few minutes later i appeared on stage my two buddies standing proudly in the wings and began to read the scene with a very charming young lady who later turned out to be magali noel a popular film actress in france germany and italy i later apologized for not having recognized her nor her famous name i remember having so much enjoyed her work in rififi another equally talented actress marpessa dawn dashed over to give me a mostassuring handshake and a warm smile no one could ever forget her in black orpheus my reading of the part went miserably enough and again i was quite prepared for the legendary thankyou dontcallus well callyou bit again i was so wrong and how wrong i was they not only offered me the part but asked me to sign the contract right then and there i conceded that this was just too good to be true hence i asked for a 24 hour thinkitover period quite reluctantly they agreed i returned to the theatre the next day at the exact hour and gave them my decisionyes everyone concerned seemed happy and excited including me who couldnt have been more disinterested at the outset of this whole experience the happiness and excitement unknowingly was to be reversed later i commenced intensive study of the text and discovered that the role of david a southern american negro graduate law student was indeed an interesting one from many points of view the first being i was tremendously impressed that someone had had the courage to write a part of great dignity and intelligence for a negro actor especially in a play dealing with racial problems in the u s i felt that i was obliged to become an actor in three short weeks in order to play such a choice rolethinking that if i did a reasonably acceptable job it would perhaps inspire other writers to follow the trend of marcel ayme after eleven days of really gruelling study of the text and character i emerged having learned and memorized some 250 lines that would stagger the most seasoned actorto say nothing of learning it in the french language marcel aymes style is considered to be fiendishly difficult even for the french i felt proud to have worked so well and felt at this point i was ready to begin staging the part with the director andre villiers that is where the trouble started monsieur villiers gave me a brief rundown on the stage business in my big scenes with mile noel i had a general idea of what he wanted so i did not press him for minute details as i was sure he would bring all those to my attention as the rehearsals progressed i was happier than i can remember because i suppose of the tremendous challenge it proposed it was during the more detailed points of interpretation that monsieur villiers and i began to see things quite differently he insisted that i portray the role of david in a stereotype uncle tom manner and of course i was not only shocked but thoroughly embarrassed at first i thought i had not understood him correctly i had my fellow players showed equal shock and embarrassment that he should distort the original conception of the part thereby robbing it of the personal dignity pride and intelligence of anyone who possessed a masters degree in law as had david i knew full well i had not misunderstood the text nor the original intentions of the author and i stood my ground but firmly i tried to reason with him and even told him that no negro student in america today would act like thaton the contrary i went so far as to ask if he read the newspapers if he had he would know that it is the students that have brought about equality for negroes in america he wouldnt hear me out and stubbornly stood by his guns after innumerable disputes i finally walked out of rehearsal just four days before opening night immediately i went to every newspaper in paris including the associated press and told my story the next morning it certainly was the scandale de paris the first newspaper i went to i was promptly given the runaround and was told by three different people that there was no one there to talk to me i accepted this untruth 43 and made my way to the ap office in paris and was interviewed by a very kind gentleman named mcnulty who hails from california only after the ap called to verify my abdication of the role did the other papers give me an interview many people mostly french have said to me that it must have taken great courage for me to give up my first starring role in what appeared at first to be an important play i personally do not consider it courage at all but rather my way of aiding the cause of black peoples everywhere many of whom have given their lives and my contribution is nothing by comparison the play was finally reviewed on sept 21st after an african young man replaced me and they agreed with me to the man that it was the most oldfashioned boring and insulting play to be presented to the french public about life in the southern united states the critics even went on to reprimand the author for having the audacity to set himself up as an authority on a subject about which he knows so little alongside tennessee williams and william faulkner the critics recalled that its the second time that marcel ayme has attacked the u s in that he wrote la mouche bleue the blue fly a few seasons back which only lasted three days i feel very sure that his last similar effort louisiane will meet the same fate elegy to charles laury

days americas literary critics will stumble on the fact that there is indeed something rancid in the soul of the south as it is now they tend to concede only that professional southerners are preoccupied with the wrongs and sufferings they endured at the hands of the reconstructionists a hundred years ago and that these tragic victims have legitimate gripes the critics look no further and no deeper just possibly because to do so would involve them in an allpervading moral mess from which they now superiorly disassociate themselves instead of meeting headon what stares them in the face

prodigious research by dillon a professor of history at texas technological college recreates the whole climate of politics and depravity that affected the question of slavery in the decades immediately preceding the civil war by frank london brown wendolyn brooks has a quiet face when she smiles her eyes seem to be laughing at something which only she understands it is as though she were amused by some aspect of a joke which we have missed as though she were including the whole world in the joke it is difficult to see gwendolyn brooks the pulitzer prize winning poet when you are looking at gwendolyn brooks the woman she is cryptic in her lack of pretension baffling in her perfect role as just a chicago housewife not long ago a newspaper man from sweden called her up explaining that he was an ardent admirer of her poetry and that he would like very much to interview her before he left the city three other men were there when he arrived all of them novelists the men began talking about the philosophical trends in contemporary literature about race relations thruout the world and similarly weighty topics gwendolyn brooks spent the entire evening serving coffee tea and cookies and emptying ash trays it was nearly morning when the newsman realized that he hadnt heard a squeak out of gwendolyn at his request she read one of her poems then exhausted by the long evening he tottered back to his hotel still wondering what gwendolyn brooks is really like only the shelves of books in her tiny gray walled living room give her away only her work exposes her as the consummate artist she is her poems and stories are about people she can make a poem about a 47th street hepcat ring so true that cold shivers run up your spine she can write of an abor54 tion or a childs coming home from school in a way that is almost ethereal yet as stunning as a quick left jab her style reminds you of virginia woolf at her best but when you think of the complexity of ideas in her work you must think of william faulkner and when you consider her force and photographic clarity you must recall thomas wolfe because she generates so much electricity in her writing it is all the more ironic that on that may night in 1950 when a newspaper reporter telephoned her and asked do you know youve won the pulitzer prize gwendolyn brooks was literally in the dark the power company had cut off her lights until she could scrape together enough money to pay her bill she received the news with a scream then she took her little boy to the movies even on the threshold of fame she could not act the part of the laureled poetess in annie allen the book which had earned her the prize she mused and if the sun comes how shall we greet him shall we not dread him after so lengthy a session in the shade her years in the shade were not always happy but they were productive for gwendolyn has been writing as long as she can remember as early as age 7 she was embroiled in a literary dispute her school teacher finding her handwriting hard to take it is still hieroglyphic today gave her an f on a composition gwendolyns mother angered by the womans obvious lack of perception informed the teacher that gwendolyn was probably a better writer than the teacher and read the composition on the spot the teacher agreed and changed the grade later critics have not needed to be intimidatedtheir praise has been continuous and loud paul engle of the university of iowa calls her work the best poetry that is being written in chicago these days rolfe humphries reviewing her poems in the nation said her strength consists of boldness invention a daring to experiment a naturalness that does not scorn literature but absorbs it exploits it the famous negro poet claude mckay wrote a poem to her and richard wright the late pioneering novelist proclaimed her technique and fire when gwendolyn was 13 her technique may have been shaky but the fire was already smoldering she was editor publisher and circulation manager of the champlain weekly probably the only newspaper in history which was handwritten and delivered by its publisher and she had a marvelous source of newsher mother as the ladies in the neighborhood poured out their souls to mrs brooks she in turn poured their stories into gwendolyns eager ears and gwendolyn poured them into the pages of her little newspaper two things combined to sabotage gwendolyns early publishing career the collective fury of outraged housewives and competition from the chicago tribune which was selling for 2 cents a copy while production costs forced her to sell her news for a nickel in 1936 gwendolyn then 19 received a two year certificate from wilson junior college that ended her school days she wanted a degree but hard times dictated a paying job and she found herself working in an unusual office opening letters laying aside the coins and bills that fell out of them and answering them the answers were brief my dear mrs jones i am sure your husband still loves you you must have faith and continue using the love potion thank you for your order the office was a kind of church gwendolyn remembers and it was in the mecca building that used to be at 33d and state the rev the man who ran the office received tons of mail from people who wanted holy thunderbolts love charms and magic potions we made the charms and brewed the potions ourselves i got 8 a week and i hated it when the reverend offered to make me assistant pastor i quit the experience was not wasted though she is completing a new novel based on her recollections of the mecca building at 22 gwendolyn met her man henry blakely wrote poetry and the attraction was mutual and instantaneous they were married a month later reading books all night writing together in silence in the same room reading their work to each other going to writers workshopsit was gwendolyns dream turned real but real too was their need for money too real were the dreary one room kitchenette apartments they lived in over the stores near the l track it was in these days and these places that gwendolyn wrote one of the best known poems of her first collection a street in bronzeville it was entitled simply kitchenette building we are things or gray hours and the involuntary plan grayed in and gray dream makes a giddy sound not strong like rent feeding a wife satisfying a man but could a dream send up thru onion fumes its white and violet fight with fried potatoes and yesterdays garbage ripening 56 in the hall flutter or sing an aria down these rooms gwendolyn brooks was living the life she wrote about the tears in her poems were her own as her words slipped into print the honors came and the prizes twice she was winner of the poetry workshop award twice she received the guggenheim fellowship for creative writing the american academy of arts and letters and the national institute of arts and letters both gave her grants and in 1945 mademoiselle magazine named her one of americas 10 women of the year in 1949 she returned these favors by producing her masterpiece of collected poems annie allen today gwendolyn and her husband an as yet unpublished novelist who earns the familys livelihood as an insurance adjuster live with their 10 year old daughter nora in a small one story frame house on chicagos south side their son henry jr is in the marines she is just a little more subdued than in earlier days altho she no longer belongs to a civil_rights organization she met her husband at an naacp youth council meeting in her latest book of poetry the bean eaters she utters one of the most piercing outcries against the murder of chicagoan emmett till that has ever appeared in print she is familiar now with the hollow land of fame but she has never lost sight of the rainbow love is the rainbow she chases love in the broadest sense love of each man and woman by each man and woman she wants to show her readers the golden cord of humanity that unites every girl in a tattered dress and every girl in a gown of silk she declares it in her precise but passionate poetry and in the jazzlike experiments of her one short novel maude martha she is saying that birth happiness sorrow and toil are much more extraordinary than they usually seem to us she is saying that lifes real magic lies in these things alone and that we are still strangers to the reality which we have abandoned in our search for some vague higher truth in her childrens book bronzeville boys and girls she puts the essential question of our existence so gently

they egation blocks their nomic opportunities tand they have an injegro market since it rtain limited opporgroowned business e almost always exthe white market it becomes a matter of vast importance to properly cultivate the negro market with few exceptions therefore negroowned business is dependent upon the negro market historically the negro operated in the field of general business before the emancipation proclamation a negro slave lunsford lane of raleigh north carolina purchased his freedom from the sale of a superior smoking tobacco which he and his father manufactured thorny lafon a free negro in new orleans operated a drygoods store from which he branched out into the moneylending business to accumulate an estate of 413000 at his death in 1893 stephen smith and william whipper were successful lumber and oyster merchants in philadelphia they owned and operated one of the largest coal yards in the city of brotherly love it was reported in 1849 that the firm held 250000 feet of lumber 22 merchantmen cars running between baltimore and philadelphia and 9000 worth of stock in the columbia bridge their notes were accepted anywhere for any amount smith donated 150000 in 1864 for the establishment of a home for aged and infirmed colored people other examples of successful negro businessmen in the 18th and 19th centuries can be found in many books and papers dealing with this subject caterers carriage makers newspaper publishers shopkeepers and other negro businessmen were operating in boston washington charleston philadelphia and savannah during this period during and after world war i the continuous fluid migration of negroes to centralcity areas from rural areas created a new demand for services never before witnessed in the nation barber shops beauty parlors restaurants funeral parlors candy stores bootblack parlors small grocery stores and novelty shops spring up like mushrooms in new york atlanta detroit chicago st louis cleveland washington philadelphia and other cities whose negro populations were growing by leaps and bounds 60 to say the least the success of many of these businesses was shortlived negroowned businesses are usually hampered by lack of capital credit restrictions lack of trained personnel and by a lack of sound methods of simple business principles these are the surefire catalytic agents which foredoom them to failure gunnar myrdal reports in an american dilemma in 1939 there were not quite 30000 negroowned retail stores including eating and drinking places giving employment to an almost equal number of proprietors and less than 14000 hired employees orapart from 1000 unpaid family members a total of 43000 persons thus negro retail trade in terms of employment is not totally insignificant compared with the size of white retail trade however it is negligible the total sales in 1939 were 71000000 which was less than twotenths of one per cent of the national total myrdal further states there were no signs of improvement in the relative position of negro retail trade the proportion of negroes among all retail dealers was if anything smaller in 1930 than in 1910 the same trend downward is visible during the period of 19291939 a more recent report shows that the major negroowned financial institutions which include 51 life insurance companies 21 savings and loan companies and 11 banks have total assets of a little over a halfbillion dollars when compared with the 478 billion dollar assets of whiteowned financial institutions in the same category the assets of 83 negroowned top financial institutions pale into almost total insignificance i briefly cite this current report to show that myrdals findings in 1939 prove that practically all negroowned businesses are retrogressing year by year when measured with comparable whiteowned businesses all is not on the red side of the ledger however great strides have been made by astute and resourceful negro businessmen and negroowned business institutions the story of h b fuller and his integrated cosmetic empire fulfills the american dream of a land of opportunity his story has graced the pages of fortune and ebony

speaking of africa our federal government is making tremendous strides in cooperating with the new independent african nations in trade and industrial development as negro businessmen with a vested interest in america we should make every possible financial effort to profitably aid in the development of these nations after all who can be a better salesman of democracy in africa than a negro businessman with some worthwhile product or service to contribute i do not intend to imply that negro businessmen should become missionaries in africa they should seek to establish bona fide business relations and in so doing will bring to the african nations those products and services which they sorely need many other successful cases of enterprising negro businessmen can be cited all over the world the examples pointed out prove that negroowned business can succeed in practically every type of industry in the total economy the disturbing problem of negroowned business however is its inability to keep pace with other business enterprises in the total economy as previously stated when negroowned businesses are matched with the same types of whiteowned businesses they pale by comparison into almost total insignificance following are major steps which must be taken by negroowned business to assure growth expansion competence and even survival in our everchanging economy 1 develop a sound research program which is so necessary in planning for the present as well as for the future 2 relegate the function of marketing which includes advertising sales sales promotion and public relations to the policymaking level 3 prepare sales campaigns with imagination and enthusiasm and with welldefined incentives for salesmen 4 develop topflight continuous training programs for all personnel 5 develop an image of goodwill and respect for your business by planning an effective public relations program 6 seek out and develop new investment possibilities in reference to financial institutions such opportunities as housing developments savings and loan associations the granting of loans to competent young negroes with sound ideas and other imaginative investment potentials are available 7 seek new profits by mergers acquisitions and diversification into mutually profitable related businesses 8 avoid the employment of relatives and close friends when their lack of competence acts as a detriment to the effective operation of the business 9 create new ways of adding to the longrange value of products by offering new services and developing new attitudes toward the increasingly sophisticated consumer 10 eliminate the concept of negro business and operate in the sphere of negrocontrolled business serving the community with competence by meeting competitive prices and standards a short story by joe gores d brandeis editor of the holyoke weekly courier drove north it was good to be getting away for a couple of weeks holyoke had never had a lynching before and in mississippi that was a pretty good record he looked to his right to the broad slow sprawl of water the greenclad bluffs with naked rock showing through southerners were like the river placid on top and slowly seething underneath up here in minnesota folks werent like that in the deepening dusk the tires whined hypnotically the lynching had been inevitable of course wilson should have left the white woman alone during the sheriffs token trial for complicity eds editorials had scored the northern meddlers deeply on that point wilson had deserved lynching he had argued besides what could the sheriff have done the power of a mob is awesome state militia a man doesnt call in armed strangers against his friends and neighbors the sheriff had been acquitted and the couriers circulation had soared ed had been on the side of the right still it somehow bothered him he was glad to just get alone and think a couple of miles beyond one of the sleepy river hamlets that dot the mississippi ed stopped for a hitchhiker he was a short heavyset youth with closecropped black hair and tight levis and an orange windbreaker thanks for the lift mister he grinned crawling in beside ed im just going to the next town tonight thatll be swell the boy yawned and stretched spreading his arms wide across the back of the seat he had a broad neck and his dark eyes were hypnotically intense in a conversational tone he said theres a dirt road up here to the right use it what use it pops the boy shouted ramming something hard and cold and round against the back of eds neck or ill spread your brains all over the windshield i really will ed wrenched the heavy battered buick into the side road he recognized incipient hysteria in the voice pull in on the other side of that big oak and stop ed slowed the car swung obediently in behind the spreading hardwood tree the lights glared back from waxy foliage okay pops open your door slow keep both hands in sight knew a fellow once kept an automatic strapped between the seat and the door on the drivers side thats fine now step free of the door good just like an old pro ed thought grimly when this is over sonny getting struck on the back of the head is not painful it is merely a cessation of consciousness he didnt even feel his teeth bite at the ground but waking up is painful ed moved his head and knew momentary agony he groaned he rolled over and sat up slowly as if he had a glass neck there was no blood the kid had used the flat of the barrel his wallet was gone of course he walked back toward the town no cars passed him twice he rested in the weedchoked ditch finally he came to a drivein root beer stand but it was closed funny then he passed a roadside cafe closed too maybe they were mennonites or something a street angled off the highway flanked by a small park with a war memorial in the center and coollooking grass under the hardwoods coming toward him in the early dusk was a boy with a loaf of bread under his arm wheres the sheriffs office in this town asked ed the boy went into a halfcrouch holding his loaf of bread like a club with his fingers sunk deeply into the garish waxedpaper wrapper you you get away he shrieked then he dropped the bread and took off across the street like a scalded cat ed shook his head a nut at the next intersection was a barbers candystriped pole and a water fountain with a mongrel snuffling around in front of it could have been holyoke except for the deserted streets stooping for water at the fountain ed saw his refection in the barbers windows maybe it wasnt so strange the kid had run a big dark paunchy man unshaven eyes abnormally bright shirt ripped trousers muddied on the corner was a twostory red brick building that could have been the jail a little girl about five leading a puppy by a string tied to its miniature red leather collar trotted out of the alley behind the building the puppys tiny tan ears flopped almost under its feet at each step hi there honey ed squatted down on the sidewalk the girl had stopped and was staring at him she had long brown ringlets her puppy wagging all over with unquenchable puppy friendliness made a puddle on the sidewalk his name is andy said the girl solemnly mommy told me not to talk to strangers im no stranger honey my name is ed and im trying to find the sheriff can you tell me where his office is the girl pulled her puppys string and started off im still not supposed to talk 65 to strangers honey if youd cindy run honey ed whirled a tall handsome woman in a grey tailored suit had rounded the corner in front of the brick building run quick to mommy as the girl fled ed heard the clatter of running feet from the alley thank god a cop officer the policeman hit him right in the middle exactly like a lineman hitting a quarterback who is about to throw eds right elbow struck the sidewalk sickeningly he tried to push the frenzied man away but the woman kicked him in the neck from behind strong hands jerked him up with momentary strength he lashed out and the policeman fell away bruised mouth gaping ed caught the glint of a fivepointed star pinned to the khaki shirt of the man behind him he had found the sheriff for the second time that evening something struck him crushingly across the back of the head out out cold got him huh thats right mr kraley right in front of the jail ed opened his eyes he was slumped in a straightback chair in the center of a bare windowless room with his hands shackled behind his back the man who belonged to the voice was talking on a wall phone beside the door he was a potbellied policeman with a badlybruised jaw ya he said into the phone the sheriffs daughter her ma stopped in here to ask walt if hed be home at

unmoved thats for cindy he said somehow ed got his feet under him his clothes reeked of the mess he had made there was no fight whatsoever in him he no longer wondered why wilson had not resisted the mob which had dragged him from his cell i have to warn you that anything you say can be used against you said the other man with obvious distaste im walt labresch and im sheriff here the moonfaced cop

supposed to have done a door slammed heavily and a huge man wearing dark trousers and a wilted white shirt with his tie pulled askew burst into the room his sleeves were rolled up over enormously hairy arms and he smelled strongly of stale sweat he had a cruellyhooked nose and his mouth was a trap is this the bastard one big arm tried to sweep labresch out of the way labresch wouldnt sweep let me at him walt ill fix his water you arent fixing anything alderman youre on the town council you know violence doesnt solve anything who told you wed picked anyone up clarence called as quick as you

god the troopers are coming what about tear gas there aint any labresch raised his voice clarence hey clarence get in here ed had been aware of a mutter of sound from the street outside it was already swelling in volume he could see through the door and across the outside office against the panes of the street windows was an uneasy smoky flickering he knew only too well torches clarence where in the hell the upper panes of one of the windows shattered inward and a brick thudded on the floor clarence shouted labresch again douse every light in the place some damn fools sure to have a gun another brick smashed through a window and then as if cued by his voice a shot rang out and a slug whined into the wall labresch ran into the next room and the lights went out abruptly there was a cheer from outside ed followed him to the door clarence bugged out said labresch he was crouched behind the desk dialling the phone into it he said this is labresch again listen where areyou mean clarence didnt call you at all dammit get some men over here right away ive got a mob on my hands and ten minutes that long well all i can do is try to hold them he hung up and looked at ed im going out to reason with them stay down dont try anything cute theyre all around the building if you go out theyll pick you to pieces ed nodded to show he understood there was little he could do with his hands shackled labresch unlocked the front door and stepped out the crowd fell momentarily silent and the torches steadied okay folks the funs over go homeall of you a voice called give him to us walt youre breaking the law especially the man who fired that shot ill overlook that because i know how you feel but state troopers will be here soon and theyll arrest any man they find on the streets with his erect body and hard eyes labresch was the type of man before whom a mob instinctively hesitates and the threat of troopers had considerably sobered them for the first time ed wondered what would have happened in holyoke if the militia had been called then kraley shouted you got three minutes to hand him out walt well hurt you if you dont and then well get him anyway labresch stepped back inside and shot the bolt as he passed the desk he scooped up a sawedoff shotgun and began ramming shells into it a shower of bricks and stones was rattling against the front of the building like monstrous hail the flickering torches danced vast menacing shadows on the walls through the glassless windows kraley had tipped them over the edge they wanted blood now they wanted the blood of ed brandeis ed was scared it was so damned unfair he deserved a chance to be heard two minutes walt kraleys voice was almost lost in the bedlam from the desk labresch said without humor someones been watching tv again the phone lines been cut fascinated ed stared at the big clock across the room ticking off the seconds of his life from the street kraleys voice shouted the death of another minute labresch checked the shotgun again and started for the front door for gods sake said ed hoarsely im not the one they want youve got to believe me im an innocent man in his mind wilson grinned in bony delight i dont believe you but what the hell difference would it make if you were innocent you mean youyou arent giving me to them i dont believe in many things mister but i believe in the law same as another man believes in his religion these people elected me to enforce the law and dammit thats what i got to do he already was going out the door when kraley shouted with a voice that shook the torches times up walt the sheriff ducked out and slammed the thick oak door behind him the mobs forward surge faltered under the menace of his shotgun labreschs grimlydetermined face stood out starkly in the torch light high cheekbones and glittering eyes accenting his probable frenchindian blood this mans in legal custody and anyone who there was a single flat unechoing report the slug knocked him back against the heavy door and dropped him to his knees kraley waved his arm like a squad leader starting into combat but he only made two paces i said hes in legal custody stand right there kraley labreschs voice was weaker more dangerous because it was thinned to the breaking point the dark stain was spreading rapidly across his shirt come on kraley shouted no one moved labreschs unwavering shotgun seemed to point at every mans navel several stragglers stealthily backed away then the man next to kraley threw down his torch at the same instant the thin wail of sirens came from the highway dark shapes suddenly broke and exploded in all directions like flushed quail kraley hesitated staring about him numbly then he threw away his torch and lumbered for the shadows labresch fell forward heavily on his face his shotgun struck the cement steps and clattered down discharging both barrels the shot ripped large patches from the deserted blacktop i wish hed known said ed brandeis sitting on a corner of the sheriffs desk he sipped cold coffee glass crunched when he shifted his foot i wish hed found out that i wasnt the one the state trooper wore a very natty twotone blue uniform and was young with straight blond hair cut short and the sort of physique that a uniform flatters so what if hed known hed have been just as dead it might have made a difference said ed stubbornly if that crazy kid had cracked up your car an hour sooner that would have made a difference or if that clarence had phoned us when he was supposed to the erect handsome chestnuthaired woman came out of the smaller room where labreschs body had been laid out on a cot her eyes were red but her voice was quite steady why did he have to do it mr brandeis he had everything to live for and and ed licked his lips he was suddenly very glad that they didnt know about wilson he was wearing a badge mrs labresch he said heavily i want him back i want him back so very much she passed a hand across her eyes even though you werent the man they wanted i wish walt had let them take you im sorry but its true staring at her uncomprehending grief ed surprised himself by saying i wish he had too then he turned abruptly away id like to get some sleep now sure mr brandeis said the trooper you can give us your deposition later im sorry about your car i dont give a damn about that ed stopped at the head of the stairs beneath his feet was the freshlyscrubbed place where walt labresch had bled there were tiny scars on the cement where the shotgun had clattered down funny he had left holyoke to get away from it but its never that easy he descended to the deserted shadowy street the air was fresh and wild with the mississippi river smell that no man could ever change as he walked aimlessly down the sidewalk in the mornings cool pale dawning ed brandeis wondered if he would ever lose his secret feeling of shame the lover my husband remembered that he too had chewed tar as a boy it was good for the teeth too charles went on to say it made the teeth real white i liked the taste too in fact i used to swallow the juice my husband placed his bare white arm alongside charles deeper colored one and in a mockserious tone said well now that accounts for the difference in our colors you swallowed more juice than i did we all had a good laugh about this and forgot it taking the conversation into other channels but my eightyearold daughter it developed took the whole thing very seriously the next day my little girl and her friend came in from play with black stains over their hands and beneath their fingernails the expressions on their faces reflected profound disappointment somewhat concerned i asked my daughter what was wrong we tried it mom she explained looking sadly up at me we ate the tar and it didnt even work we the adults were amused but our hearts were touched by our little tar babies who saw so much love in our friend that they wanted to be like him this kind of love imagines no color barrier but reaches out in response to that which is real within everyone christs love reaching out through each of us is the answer by doris e saunders t was monday the 25th of february in 1895 and at the douglass es tate in anacostia d c the great statesman was to leave his beloved cedar hill for the last time only five days before he had left his home going down the snowcovered path to the big open meeting of the national council of women in washington where he had greeted his old friend susan b anthony returning to cedar hill from that meeting in good spirits the aged warrior recounted the events of the meeting to his wife helen pitts douglass had been an ardent feminist even before she married frederick so that it was natural that she would be interested in the progress of the womens suffrage movement her husband said that the womens suffrage movement was in many respects a continuation of the antislavery movement and that the freedom of women was but an extension of the freedom of the negro a forerunner to the complete emancipation of all people during the recounting of mrs anthonys comments helen douglass noticed that her husband seemed a little tired and then he fell moments later he was dead the career that had begun in a slave cabin on the eastern shore of maryland was ended the name of frederick douglass of course was known throughout the length and breadth of this country as well as abroad he never knew exactly when he was born but he assumed from other events that it was sometime in february 1817 about 1841 he escaped from his master and shortly after began to lecture on the evils of slavery under the auspices of the massachusetts antislavery society his eloquence was such that he soon became widely known as an oratora man of true and moving power his autobiography published in 1845 so enraged slaveholders that even in a free state he was in danger so that he fled to england where he continued lecturing in the cause of abolition kind english friends collected money and purchased his freedom thus enabling him to return in safety to the us where with backing from his english benefactors he founded the north star the antislavery paper he had dreamed of editing the paper was issued weekly from rochester n y until slavery was abolished a friend of william lloyd garrison and of john brown douglass continued to grow in power and influence when the civil war began president lincoln sought his advice in the use of negroes as soldiers and after that douglass helped to enlist men in the 54th massachusetts regiment the first regiment of negro soldiers from the north after the war he moved to washington and for several years edited the new national era another weekly newspaper later he served the us government as marshal recorder of deeds for the district and finally as minister to haiti he continued to work on his autobiography and each new edition brought it further along the final publication is titled the life and times of frederick douglass even in his final years he was erect carrying his massive white bearded head on broad shoulders with vigor and great dignity now frederick douglass slave orator editor abolitionist marshal of the district of columbia commissioner to santo domingo and minister to haiti president of the freedmens bank and one of the greatest americans of any agelay in the parlor of cedar hill in a large oaken casket serenely at rest cedar hill the 14acre douglass estate sits proudly on the crest of a hill overlooking washington and the potomac river the 20room white colonialstyle brick and stucco house is surrounded by the lofty oaks and cedars which give it its name and this last morning a fresh snow had covered the already fallen snow to give to douglass beloved home and grounds a new mantle for his departure the rev hugh stevenson of the local anacostia baptist church had come up the hill to conduct a private funeral service for the family before the body was removed to metropolitan ame church in washington the widow came into the dim parlor and took a seat in the small circle of chairs that had been arranged in a semioval facing the casket a small woman she seemed to have contained her emotions behind a stoic new england calm only the bloodless knuckles of her hands which she clasped tightly together indicated the stress she had undergone in the days since her husband fell dead at her feet douglass son lewis and her two daughters estella and hattie sprague and charles son joseph now joined mrs douglass in the semicircle it had been no secret that this second white wife of frederick douglass had never been accepted by the douglass children and grandchildren however there had never been any question in douglass mind that he had done the right thing in marrying helen from the beginning when his old friend francis j grimke had protested that such a marriage was suicide douglass had not wavered i should be false to all the purposes and principles of my life if i did not marry this noble lady who has done me the honor to consent to be my wife he replied i am a free man i am free even of making appearances just to impress would it not be ridiculous if after having denounced from the housetops all those who discriminate because of the accident of skin color i myself should practice the same folly 76 but antipathies were for the occasion ignored and now the family kneeled together in prayer for the man they all loved deeply the brief prayer over the family listened in silence as reverend stevenson read from the scriptures then the great casket was closed the bitter cold of the past week had abated somewhat and a light snow still fell as the casket was removed to be taken into washington to the metropolitan ame church for the services to be held later in the day the family retired behind the solid doors of cedar hill thus began the day on which frederick douglass funeral was held in washington d c the damp and penetrating cold did not deter the unhappy throngs that milled through the streets around the funeral site the metropolitan ame church had been selected for the services primarily for its ability to cope with the hundreds of persons expected to attend the services douglass detachment to organized religion had caused him to be accused of atheism and he was constantly contrasting the behavior of socalled christians who did not practice the brotherhood and charitable love they preached with free thinkers such as garrison and ingersoll he often said how unfortunate it was for many pious souls hate the negro while they think they love the lord wisely the reverend j t jenifer minister of metropolitan understood that douglass was in spirit a free religionist who trusted in a divine providence and had no uneasiness about his personal relationship with god jenifer was happy that metropolitan had been selected for the funeral though frederick douglass was not a member of any church by ten oclock that morning the street outside the church was clogged with carriages and people as the time for th services approached the crowd increased to such proportions that passage was almost impossible those who were fortunate enough to have the small white cards of invitation were admitted to the church early the general public was not admitted until after the beginning of the services palms and ferns were banked about the main altar where the casket was placed the great figure leonine even in death was surrounded by floral offerings from heads of state politicians and friends from around the world on the casket a simple spray of lilies from helen since the evening in january 1884 when helen pitts 46yearold white spinster had become mrs frederick douglass their love mutual interest and understanding had forged a bridge that covered the difference in their years as well as their race at that time helen had said love came to me and i was not afraid to marry the man i loved because of his color now widowed she had those years of happi ness and fulfillment to sustain her she would have preferred a simple service but she realized that frederick belonged to the people whom he had spent his life in serving so she kept silent it was nearly two oclock in the afternoon before the funeral procession filed into the church first the family followed by the honorary pallbearers former u s senator blanche k bruce he and his wife stood up with helen and frederick when they were married w h wormley john r lynch john e cook exgov of louisiana p b s pinchback john r francis f g barbadoes d l pitcher john h brooks dr c b purvis former head of freedmens hospital the son of abolitionist robert purvis who with douglass had been one of the prime movers in the american antislavery society and congressman george w murray among the notables in attendance were justice john marshall harlan the famous dissenter in the civil_rights cases of 1893 and the later plessy v ferguson harlans dissenting opinions are still cited by lawyers and laymen who reject the validity of these decisions senators sherman and hoars and a number of members of the house of representatives judge and mrs robert mary church terrell susan b anthony a large delegation from the womens council and dr daniel hale williams the new head of freedmens hospital and a distant kinsman of the great fallen leader finally all were seated and the services began the choir started softly with nearer my god to thee followed by a prayer for the soul of the deceased by the rev fr alexander crummell of st lukes episcopal church the choir now in full voice sang in thy cleft o rock of ages then bishop alexander wayman a pioneer in the african methodist movement in the south and a contemporary of douglass from the eastern shore of maryland read the nineteenth psalm his full and rich voice hung in the air as the last words of the psalm were uttered let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in they sight o lord my strength and my redeemer now reverend jenifer began the delivery of the funeral sermon douglass beliefs were too well known to be ignored so reverend jenifer stated flatly frederick douglass was a christian he broke with the american church and with the american christian dogma when he saw that it sanctioned and sustained the enslavement and the bondage of a brother he held christ to be above creed and above the church this explained he then continued with the traditional eulogy following jenifers sermon reverend stevenson of the anacostia baptist church and dr j e ran78 kin president of howard university read tributes to the dead the remarks of the haitian minister to the united states were interpreted by the former u s minister to haiti j l durham then the aging susan b anthony spoke of douglass and his labors in behalf of the negro vote and his championing of womens rights then john hutchinson of boston now extremely aged with snowy beard and long white hair reaching down to his shoulders recalled the days when the hutchinson family the minnesingers of american freedom accompanied frederick in the tours of new england seeking converts to the doctrine of abolition then in his frail voice he sang the abolition song that his brother jesse had dedicated to douglass years before ill be free ill be free and none shall confine with fetters and chains this spirit of mine from my youth i have vowed in god to rely and despite the oppressor gain freedom or die when his voice was still even the most composed and reconciled eyes were moist now the benediction was pronounced by bishop williams of the colored methodist episcopal church in south carolina by now it was after five oclock and the winter sky had darkened instead of diminishing the crowd had grown so that it was nearly impossible for the funeral procession to make its way to the waiting carriages the negro letter carriers of the district escorted the body to the depot where it was placed on the 710 train for rochester n y reaching there the following morning helen lewis charles rosetta and the three grandchildren accompanied the body the family truce lasted throughout the period of the funeral rochester was in mourning it was nearly 10 oclock before the cortege of the former distinguished resident of rochester left the depot for the city hall this was helens home as well as fredericks but she had never lived with him here as his wife it was anna who had been the wife of frederick douglass in rochester and the house on alexander street had been his underground railway station headquarters douglass had been proud that no united states marshal had ever taken a fugitive slave from rochester so to rochester he returned accompanying the body to the city hall where it lay in state for several hours were the mayor members of the common council and other city officials and the honorary pall bearers the douglass league of rochester moving from the city hall to the central presbyterian church the hearse wound through endless lines of silent spectators following the invocation by r h h stebbins and the eulogies a male quartet sang hail thou me helen recalled that douglass had hummed the tune the day before he died then the organist played swing low sweet chariot and as the funeral cortege made its way from the church the ninth symphony of beethoven filled the building helen had the last word with this sound in their ears the mourners made their slow way to mount hope cemetery here frederick douglass was laid to rest why i became an actor by sidney poitier interviewer what made you decide to be an actor poitier what made me decide to be an actor well i decided to become an actor because i had tried a great many other things i had no skilled trade so the things i tried all were of aworkingwithyourhands style and it bored me quickly all of it i was a ditch digger a dish washer a car washer a porterand these are for me very boring activities always have been one day i found in a newspaper a negro newspaper specifically the amsterdam news the new york amsterdam news on the advertisement page an ad saying actors wanted and i figured having tried everything else you knowand i was quite young i figured what the hell ill give this a go i went ahead and i told them i was an actor and they said read something for us well i read very poorly they threw me out promptly my pride was hurt terribly hurt i had never been rejected so so forcefully before and i said to myself well dammit ill show them ill read good for them so i set out on a sixmonth campaign of trying to orientate my speech of trying to gather a kind of onedimensional understanding of the theatre and gather certain catch phrases theatre phrases such as whatever you use if you are an inperson in the theatre and i went back and thats how i became an actor interviewer why is it that acting had appealed to you at all had you been to plays poitier no i had not been to plays i thought that actors made good money and i wanted to make money and i also wanted to do something other than manual labor you see i was illequipped to do anything else but manual labor i thought here is a field that probably i could take hold in you know if im lucky rather than having to expose myself to five or six years of training in a school for a special craft or trade for which i didnt have the money or the time i figured i would have a go at this also i was footloose and fancyfree i was moving about in the world you know i had no great responsibilities i was young and i had thei had the freedom and the prerogative to walk off a job as a porter if i didnt like it or it bored me to tears i was a great daydreamer i would wind up leaving the job and going and sitting near the water or in central park and just dream all day interviewer about what poitier oh about things people and mostly about i think our dreams are usually made of the yearnings and needs unfulfilled you know so we go about trying to fulfill them interviewer i understand that you bought a radio and for six months you studied the diction of people you heard on it poitier i studied the diction of people on the radio because my speech was obviously west indian and not as clear or as cultivated as one needs to have it for theatre work i couldnt go to a school as a matter of fact i didnt know there was such a thing as a school for speech so i bought magazines and i would listen to the radio and i would repeat what i heard on the radio most news broadcasts and in time my speech began to lighten in the areas where it was particularly broad interviewer i was told that when you returned for an audition you brought one of the magazines you had studied to read from poitier yes true confessions magazine and i read it i read a paragraph of it as an audition as a scene plays and all that jazzi was fairly ignorant about the theatre all i had was a passion to show see in all my life although it was only a poor one and fierce one i had always had great pride and in the caribbean a young negro is never robbed of his pride as he is in some parts of the southern united states so that at the age of fifteen sixteen i wasi was fierce crude and very alive in many many senses many important senses interviewer so the rejection at the theatre was a blow to your pride poitier yes yes the rejection was a blow and a challenge you see and one that i had to accept i was told to get out of the theatre this was the american negro theatre near 135th street intervie1 er yes i know poitier i was told to get out and forget it to go back and just get a job and you see the image of whatthe image of the rejection to me was this i saw my life every subsequent year of my life i saw it in the drudgery of manual labor i saw a limit placed on my potential had i accepted the rejection as my fate then i would have been ordained to a kind of onedimensional living circumscribed by my limitations and hung in a kind of abyss of never really being able to reach beyond my grasp interviewer what else did you do to train yourself besides the reading and the radio during that sixmonth period poitier well i did a great many things in the caribbean i had gone to school for a very brief period for a year and a half and i could barely write or read however i knew certain littlei had acquired certain little hints of reading such as the phonetic way of pronunciation and if a word puzzles you you do not know its meaning you start with the first three letters et cetera et cetera so that you in turn will be able to pronounce it fairly accurately and i began to try to improve my reading you see by sight which was very hard for me but it began to improve the reason i went to a true confessions magazine primarily is because they wereaside from the fact that i didnt know anything about bookstoresthey were always very simply written and i could understand what it was saying i was not often overwhelmed by words in its structure i studied reading and i listened to the radio for speech and i used to read newspapers a great deal i didnt always know what was in them or what the articles were all about but i did know some of the words and a constant exposure to these words helped me to develop a familiarity with them so that sight and reproduction became synonymous interviewer did you use a dictionary too poitier no i did not i had a strange way of holding words that i would pronounce but did not understand their meaningholding them in abeyance for a time when i did find a sentence with the word in it so structured that i suddenly knew what it meant interviewer how many hours a day did you spend at this radio to rid yourself of the west indian accent poitier many many hours when i was working and i worked throughout this periodi worked various places i was working in the garment district for the most part evenings and mornings and whenever i could get to a magazine or a newspaper the reading was constant because i had no time for much else i had no friends the small salary from the district or wherever i worked was such that the small room i maintained and the food and the few dollars for clothingwell that was all i could afford interviewer youve made the statement that you were an actor made exclusively by friends over the years and i was curious to know whether this was a correct statement and who were the important influences upon you poitier it is a correct statement in part i am made in terms of my success by my friends people who at one time or another did me a good turn who are the friends they are varied they come from many walks of life they are people who permitted me to use them as studies they are people who are interested in my work or interested in me or interested in helpingthey are directors and writers producers and workaday folk so this though its true in part is not a definitive statement interviewer did you study other actors did you go to the theatre to watch actors our leading actors work poitier it was only in later years that i developed a kind of interest in watching other actors work in the theatre but i watched many actors work because i was always involved in class work and group work and various theatre groups that was my life you see thats where i did most of my learning i was in and out of groups and little theatres and projects i first of all couldnt afford the legitimate theatre often but i didnt take advantage of the times when i could afford it it used to bore me broadway theatre used to bore the daylights out of me until i finally became interested in certain actors there were certain actors who were my kind of actors people with great power and i would go and watch them work interviewer did you have any formal training or are you now taking formal training poitier as an actor interviewer as an actor poitier oh yes i took many years from 1946 i took formal training which is what nowfourteen years i took formal training at the american negro theatre it was training of a kind adequate for that period totally inadequate for now in 1947 48 49 50 i was always taking formal training from various people sometimes actors sometimes from a group sometimes fromsometimes for free sometimes you pay a small fee and then i eventually wound upin the 50s i wound up with the paul mann actors workshop after having taken many many years of formal training helterskelter of course but formal training interviewer paul mann as i understand it follows the stanislavsky approach to acting poitier yes interviewer are you then one of the method actors in your work or do you amalgamate method with your own methods poitier i am not a method actor i study method and i work method before i perform to explain the stanislavsky method is intended i believeand if im wrong i use it this way neverthelessi think it is intended to be used as a method of preparation for work not as a method employable in the instance of work so i use the stanislavsky method in preparing my work something which i am privileged to use over a long period of time before i go on the stage or before i go on in front of a camera which means that instead of employing the stanislavsky method for two hours a night in a theatre i employ it for two or three months in the preparation of that work so that when i go on the stage or in front of a camera my function becames organic and instant and natural spontaneous and full because i have a frame of reference for every want every need every desire that is registered on my emotion boards interviewer could you be specific here and just take us through a single part you prepared for poitier well lets take the last thing i did on the stage lets take a raisin in the sun i received the script almost a year before we went into production right and i read it naturally many many many times and i knew generally after ten or twenty readings what the circumstances of the play were i knew what the individual characters were like generally i understood my character kind of generally now i needed time to make my understanding of my character specific in so doing i must understand all of the contributing elements that go to making up this character first i must understand what are the driving forces in the man in order to understand that you must find out what are his political social economic religious milieus and how they contribute to the personality idiosyncrasies or whatever and in so examining i find that this first is a negro man thirtysix years old living in chicago on the south sidewhich of itself is quite significant in the building of a character because only a particular kind of negro lives on the south south in this particular kind of circumstances see so that narrows the field already and then we take why is this man living here is he here by choice what is his relation to his community what is his relation to his religion if he has one what is his relation to his economic disposition is it one in which he finds enough elasticity to function and maintain his manhood or it is a constant badge or remembrance of his inadequaciesyou followand all these things can be found in the script or at least if theyre not there they can be made compatible with what is in the script at one point or another so that after months of actually making specific this man in his milieuthen i come to the final conclusion of what are his wants and when i find what are his general wants i find what is his most specific want or wants i now have the man in total i know what his reaction would be to everything done and said in the playsee i know what and how he feels about his neighborhood so that any question or reference to it strikes a certain chord in a man now with this kind of information i then proceed to familiarize myself with the pros and cons of his life and his wants i try to experience them so by the time im ready to perform i dont go in a cornerat least i dont have to go in a corner and concentrate and conjure up some mysterious magic i walk on the stage and it happens and i dont work method because its too late now to work method if youre not ready forget it you walk on the stage and you find that you have taken on the milieu of the character and you then begin to seek out and fulfill the very wants that are burning inside you now which are his wants once youre on the stage you have no time because the stage is to experienceyou followthe stage is to experience once the curtain goes up and there is an audience out there you the artist your responsibility is to experience and only through your experiencing are you able really to transmityou follow there are many kinds of actors there are actors who can get on a stage but they can never quite enthrall nor can they ever quite involve or hypnotize but they can give a workmanlike job well if theyre not gifted they dont enthrall and they dont involve because they themselves are not able to involve on the level required by the artist interviewer what is the difference between these two poitier there is a basic difference to my mind between the two and ofttimes its not because of the difference in talent its sometimesit always is the difference in the humanity of the individual you see there is a phrase used by jazz musicians and they call it soul it is a reference to a certain kind of humanityof the sensitivity of humanitythat is overstocked in one person they use the word soul because there are certain gifted brilliant musicians who have a kind of human compassion thatthey are so inarticulate in every other phase of life they can only express through their music and hence they are terribly important musicians and gifted with actors i thinkthere are actors who have not as much and there are actors who are void of it now the fine actors who are void of it are called technicians they are quite capable of making you realize you are in a theatre watching a terribly gifted technician at work and you say ahh hes marvelous if he had the added gift of soul you would forget youre in a theatre thats the difference interviewer what is it that you find you like about acting poitier that i like about acting interviewer yes but if you prefer to talk about what you dont like about acting you can do that too poitier well iyou know thats an interesting question i dont know how i can answer it interviewer what do you get from acting that satisfies you poitier thats a different question i can better answer that from acting i get a sense ofof worthwhileness i feel for instance there were times in my past when out of sheer naivete and modesty i was afraid to accept the fact that i was a gifted actor it was only in later years that i realized that the gift of an actor does not belong to him that i accepted that i am a gifted actorand cannot point to any one or group of efforts on my part that created the gift i was born with it lets be honest and lets be factual i was born with a gift i had nothing to do with it when my mother conceivedthat moment the combination of genes carried inherently whatever there was that i suddenly found at the age of seventeen or eighteen so what i get from acting is using it for others using it for people i find that when i work well people enjoy it and theythings happen to them by that i mean when i use it well they share it you see and they share it in good ways you follow and thats what ithats what i get from it interviewer you have this gift but you must do something to make yourself a better actor or a better human being or whateveror am i wrong i mean is the gift there and thats the end of it poitier no its your responsibility to nurture it its like a seed its like a plant its like a child you feed it yes you nurture it you care for it interviewer how poitier well ive tried to care for it for fourteen years first of all it is important that the actor recognize that his gift is an entity the human entityin that package so the package must be cared for not only cared for but it must be cared for in ways that become advantageous to the flowering of the gift the mind and the body are the only two tools to be cared for kept not under glass but kept in good working condition above and beyond that it must be exposed to its limits constantlyto life because it then acts as an absorption board so that when the gift has to be placed in motion you are not trying to click it over a void you need to call on experiences when you are in the process of working on a partfor instance in the preproduction in the preopening periods of a partwhen you say what kind of life did this guy lead your conclusions must be not only theoryyou follow you must be able to bridge the gap between theory and experience sometimes so that in other words to play a coal miner you can read all you want about coal mining but just to know what the feel of the area is at the entrance of a coal mine is experience thats worth more than the ten volumes youll read about it so that i dont mean that the gift is there and it just begins to kick over no you nurture it and you work with it and its your responsibility now if youre going to be an artist and this is where you say this is my functionthen thats what you are in life if you are going to be a carpenter and you go through the growing pains of learning how to measure and cut and saw and nail and then if you walk away from itafter you learn ityou cant go back to it in ten years and build a house and also when you walk away from it it is because you are notyou have not committed yourself to it i commit to the theatre i commit to art thats me im thirtythree years old i have no place else to goyou follow and the only reasons i know i amthat are of importance to meare the reasons i get from my work from my milieu as an artist and from my contribution interviewer but success tends to put you in a hothouse in a comfortable hothousedoesnt it poitier success tends to put the american artist in a hothouse and it is ajust one of the many temptations potential indulgences that the artist has to face up to interviewer but how do you grow then poitier i live in a certain way i make a great deal of money and i live in new york i live in westchester i live in a lowermiddleincome community i am not ghettoized here i can live anywhere i want to live in new york state and if they wont sell me a house ill buy the land and build a house i am not ghettoized i live in a certain way i move in every circlei have to i am interested fortunately in many things im interested in politics im interested in economics im interested in art see im interested in hunger and im interested inin oppressions im interested in the independence of the african and asian states im interested in the power of the church im interested in the lack of civil liberties in the soviet union im interested in a lot of thingsbirth control and oldage pensions assistance for the aged im interested in a lot of things and im notfortunately i am not trying to force an interest i am genuinely interested in these things so i dont i mean the success is not an end interviewer how do you choose your roles do you choose them because of the acting opportunities that are available to you or do you choose them in combination with their significance to you poitier i choose my roles nowi must differentiate because in the past i was always selective only not for snobbish reasons i was always selective because most of the parts offered me were of no interest to me and i refused them and that was that the difference now is that the parts that are offered to me if they interest me and they are not quite right i get help to fix them i look for certain things not in the part only but in the play if a play or a film has a commentmind you comment is different from a statementif a play has a comment that transcends itself then i will be interested in doing it now what do i mean by a play that transcends itself if the plays comment can be made dimensionally clearly forcefully to everyone who sees it whatever their country whatever their language as long as its a man or a woman or a child of this milieu in our contemporary worldthen the play has significance for me i do not wish to make a comment that is peculiar only to a section of this country or of this world i do not wish to make a comment that is peculiar to negroes only or on behalf of negroes only i am not interested in the comment that is on behalf of americans only i cannot any more be thusly interested i want to say if im able something about people and i believe that basically people are the same everywhere if they are literate or not if they are sophisticated rich poor russian american black whitebasically they are the same and art can touch them all in the same place you see the same piece of art can touch them all that which touches only the black man not understood by the white is really not accomplishing much because ofttimes that which is understood by the black and not by the white is poison and in and of itself it becomes contradictory to the purposes intended interviewer i was going to ask you what if any difference do you find in preparation for the stage and for the films poitier there is a difference in the preparation and there is a difference in the performance on the stage in terms of the preparation you have two months or more depending on how soon you get the script or whatever your working habits are and how important you are sometimes you get a script three four months in advance you begin working then then you have the fourweek period of rehearsals and then you have a tryout usually and then you come in prepared to work two hours a night and twice on wednesdays and saturdays in the film your preparation at least mine takes a different course there are different demands made by the two mediums the stages limitations are of a nature that they make certain kinds of demands which require adjustments in the technique or in the approach to work the film makes similar demands according to its needs and limitations in the film i prepare pretty much the same way and when i am doneafter the two months or three months of preparationwhen i am done i have to begin to work in bits and pieces on what is in essence on performance which carries over an eight or tenweek period so what i do is i begin to experience each day the total up to the point i am performing so that there is a flow now how to experience it i dont sit and go through excruciating pains i just review in my mind the flow the natural flow of events involving me to this point so that i can seque into this moment this three minutes they intend to shoot today but naturally and connectedly interviewer you find the movies harder than the stage poitier yes interviewer i understand you have said in some earlier interviews that you find that the technical intrusion of cameras bothers you poitier well thats only a part of it you see the film iswell the best way to give you an example i came here at ten oclock let us assume that this is a stage and its a performance and i come in and i spend an hour here and all that we have done this morning in this interview was actually a portion of a play but i came in and i had one continuous hour in which to perform or experience if it is a film the total when it is done will be the hour similar to what we spent here but it does not flow in that manner i will come here every day for thirtysix days and i will work with you and you will work with me and in the course of one day our total the aggregate of our film time will be three minutesyou see and each day i come i must through whatever senses awareness i possessi must thread yesterdays needle with todays thread so that it would seem that no time has elapsed that is difficult now we are able in films to get around it easily because its a very technical medium and you can cut up film and nobody really cares about the performance you know unless you yourself are interested so to make a wholethat in life in a lifelike experience will unfold in an hour or two or threeto put it together bit by bit is like patchquilt work the job of the artist if he is interested is to make it seem that this is a total experience when it is done that makes it more difficult than the stage infinitely more difficult but by the same token it is in films where if someone is not interestedthe medium is a haven because he can hide behind other things the medium permits an actor to be lazy if he wishes if he has a winning personality and a nice face to look at and a not displeasing voice he can read words and move around in an attempt at playing and get away with it easier than he can on the stage because on the stage he has only one frame you see on the screen he has the twolens and the fourlens and a fiftylens and a seventyfive lens so that his image comes to us in gears it comes that way this way you know and we see all kinds of images of him and he comes so close to us we can almost touch him on the stage he remains in the same dimension so theres nothing going for him there except his work interviewer youve been playing serious roles what about comic ones i understand from what ive been reading about you that you have a talent for comedy poitier i would like to try that very much and i am going to i am sure that it will have to be as a result of my own efforts because i am now used to being thought of as a heavy actor interviewer what do you think are the prospects for the negro actor in america poitier ah good question i think they are good if the negro actor is a gifted actor and he develops himself he will work cannot help but work there will be very few limitations on the negro actor truly gifted in the future the countrythe pace of change socially in america has accelerated so that the negro actor of today is experiencing more hope and more involvement in the theatre and in pictures than ever before television and the radio are a littlestill behind the times but picturewise its coming marvelously the stage also in music and theatre and art generally the power of the gift is what counts for the most part another artist who is white if he is committed to art and he finds a gift in a black man or woman he has to use it he has to work with ityou followbecause that is his commitment like in musici dont care how sick a white musician who is dedicated to music is on the race question he would go out of his skull to play with miles davis he would go out of his skull to play with him so that directors and writers producers even who are really interested in working on a certain artistic level if they find an actor who is a mexican actor or a white actor or a black actor or a chinese actor who has great power they have to use him now on a workaday level lots has yet to be accomplished for the actor who is just soso the soso negro actor will not work with the consistency that the soso white actor works because the negro is unfortunately still in that kind of social thing but there is hope there is much hope the salvation of the negro actor also will be realized through the realization of negro writers in the theatre all kinds of good things are pointing to it interviewer what advice would you give to the beginning negro actor in terms of training for the stage poitier i would give him the same advice that i would give to the beginning actor of any other race and that is to study hard and long and fierce if you control the methods of work then you can in essence control your growth or help to control your growth if you are unable to control the body or the mind under certain work situations then youll find that youll never be able to play any one part completely the only tools you have areis the body how you move how you speak everything you do with the body becomes the essence of your work aside from learning the other aspects of acting controlling the body is the most important interviewer i vould like to extend the question a little bit i accept the fact that the advice you would give would be regardless of color but i wonder in terms of psychological or philosophical approach or attitudehow would you guide a young negro actor so that he doesnt become embittered let us say at lack of opportunity poitier let him become embittered i think that bitterness is also a fruit of life if bitterness was an end result directed toward no one else then we wouldnt mind bitterness we object to bitterness because we dont wish to be the object of it i think that bitterness is an absolutely correct reaction to some of the absurdities perpetuated on negroes in this country i will not say to a young negro actor dont become bitter if he earns the right to be bitter by god let him be bitter i do say to him earn the right to be bitter go and prepare yourself to be an artist and if you become an artistif you are on your way to realizing your potential as an artistand some bastards superimpose restrictions on your efforts get as bitter as you wantyou follow interviewer on the other hand bitterness in your own private life can be a disturbing element isnt there some approach to peace with yourself poitier are you asking if there is a way to tranquilize oneself against the intrusions of all the injustices no there isnt any way to tranquilize oneself what the negro actor should do or the negro person per se should do is not to be concerned about bitterness because it is an experience and out of it usually comes some very profound constructive philosophical attitudeusually you see and it is not essentially an adjustment because if the persons who are so busy creating these obstacles for minorities in this country if they themselves ever were to experience what those people the minorities go through they would be better human beings themselves i believe that you cannot be full in this life until you know what pain is until you know what joys are and instead of spending a lifetime like most whites in this country running from pain setting up an antiseptic life struggling and working and closing out nailing out all the adversitiespain and a little hardship and struggleand becoming essentially antiseptic i think that the more antiseptic they become the more lack of soul becomes evident so i have no great horror for bitterness on the part of negroes negroes are becoming less bitter and its marvelous that they are but the experience of bitterness has beenwill beused by them in marvelous ways you know the venom of a snake can kill and it can also be an antidote correct so i dont want to say to negroes dont be bitter if they are in a situation that provokes the bitterness let them be bitter and when the situation through their effort or through the collective effort of both sides is overcome when they overcome the bitterness then they have a frame of reference then theyve had that experience you see and it is the experience that will make of them the better manif they overcome it if they get through it do you follow interviewer i was going to ask you do you think that a negro star of your stature has problems different from the problems of a white star of your stature poitier im sure that some of my problems are peculiar to negroes but i donti dont let them bug me sometimes some of the things are painfulnot too often sometimes they hurtnot too often i dont worry about it its an experience now and usually i am ablethrough my transcending my bitternessto some extent i am able to view very compassionately the inadequacies the gigantic limitations that enmesh the perpetuators of these moments of pain for me and i do dismiss them for they are afflicted infinitely more than i interviewer living here in mount vernon and raising your children herehow do you equate this experience poitier i have an interest in not losing my balance and i also have an interest in keeping my children in a certain kind of multiracial cultural milieu and i fear antiseptic living i fear it it leads to alcohol and nicotine and a kind of stagnation intellectually and im not interested in that interviewer i read also that you dont let them know too much about your success is that true poitier yes the magnitude of my good fortune commercially is nothing whatever for them to be dealing with at this time in their lives i wish them always to have a frame of reference for everything and if they have a father who is so unlike other fathers it will begin to give them a kind of orientation that can be unhealthy its my feeling that my childrenfirst let them be children and let them be children as fully as they can be children you see and theyll deal with what their father is and theyll have toprobably have toovercome it at a later time interviewer what are the frustrations of the negro actorthat is in the ability to use the full range of his talents poitier what are the frustrations of the negro actor interviewer i mean have you yet encountered frustrations as a negro actor in being limited let us say to certain roles poitier no honestly not yet i am entering now into an area careerwise where i am sure i will bei will be involved with the frustrations because i am now interested in the kind of work as i described to you before of a certain reach and if i am not offered it i will have to try to bring about its realization by myself meaning ill produce it myself so i havent really experienced it yet ive been busy building a career and trying not to make too many outlandish compromises but now im interested in moving on to another level interviewer what is that level actually poitier well first a level of workand a level of comment they are not necessarily compatible if you must mix them but they each represent individually a step up from what has been the pattern for many years on the artistic side there is now an urgent need to do better work i think i have the potential for better work so i now must stretch interviewer what do you consider better work how do you consider an actor should progress in his career poitier better work for me now would beat least ive thought it would beto reach for a level of work that is commensurate with say another dimension in acting as in all art there is a constant reaching for another depth well the frame of reference for your trying to plumb the depths is to bring about a dimension that is almost indistinguishable from reality you see so that and that is a big task but it is interesting enough to me if i never come close it would at least permit me cause mein reaching for it to stretch myself artistically there is a dimension not yet tampered with at least by me and that is to be able to work on a parin such a way that when the experience happens it has about it an encompassing effect on an audience encompassing in that they become a part of the total so that there is not a theatre and there is not a stage now this is done in many other fields you see it is done quite often by musicians you can sit down and listen to music and in no time your mind stops thinking about business it stops and it isnt even concentrating on the music it sort of suspends itself and for a while there is nothing but a kind of total moment with the music and you and the nothingness it happens when we are speaking about something that interests us fiercely and especially when someone is saying what we want to hear we become hypnotized with our eyes wide open and we arewe are hung you see i think actors can weave this spell because in the old days storytellers wove these spells in market places all over the world hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago not with the aid of lights and sets and all that jazz so the actor can do it interviewer going back to a raisin in the sun i recall that mr atkinson in the times said that you were as effective when you had words to say as when you were silent obviously you conveyed that excitement from many directions you have much encouragement in achieving your goal poitier well see how the next step goes interviewer i gather that you are studying shakespeare that you have hopes to perform in shakespeare is that true poitier that is no longer true interviewer why is that poitier well i am i was interested in shakespeareveryand then i found a very interesting truth and it is thisi found i was interested in shakespeare because of a kind of coercion interviewer a coercion poitier yes i was coerced into an interest in shakespeare by the awesomeness of its reputation by the correctness of a man of my position having to at one point or another say that i would like to play shakespeare it is the thing to do and it is the comment to make and i started reading it and i kept saying id like to play shakespeare but it seems to be actually a status symbol toto reach a point where you can say all right i want to play shakespeare i dont want to play shakespeare essentially first because i am not trained sufficiently to play shakespeare most of shakespeares stuff bores me to tears i enjoy infinitely more to read the words because the man was indeed a geniusjust to read the structure of his sentences i lie in bed with a shakespeare book and have a ball to play it im not interested its that simple interviewer thats a very sound confession i think that even in writing to reach beyond your interests is purely a form of snobbism poitier now it would be reaching beyond my interests if i do change my mind because of additional information or because of additional changes in my values ill play it i will begin to prepare again to play it but as of now i am in a period where i would much prefer just to read it just to read it because to read it is an experience its very wonderful its relaxing and itsits a kind of freedom you experience reading it to realize that a mind or a man was so gifted to put words together in this order it is fantastic interviewer why is it that youve concentrated your energiesand this may be an obvious or rhetorical question or maybe even naive but i think that it should be asked and i think i know part of the answer but why is it that youve confined your interests to hollywood in opposition to the stage poitier because i have three children and one on the way by the way and a wife a mother and father a motherinlaw and various and sundry other relations who are not as fortunate as i and who in some manner or other depend on me for livelihood i cannot work long under the constant pressure of or the call of the economic so i am doing my two years in hollywood style my deals are so constructed that two more jobs and my relatives and i will not have to respond economically to pressuremeaning that its a tricky business and i understand it very well the business of it if i have no money and wish to remain in the theatre i must fight a constant battle of integrity versus the icebox you see i find it disconcerting to do that if i have to do it because of my circumstances are such then i would do it but i have seen a way to circumvent its being a constant thorn in my side when my success came as fledgling as it is my representatives and i sat down and we determined to get me a work relation with the people i work for of a nature that i can be paid over a long period of time rather than to take monies up front so my monies now areand its all legal taxwisepaid to me in a livable sum on the first of january every year for twentyfive years which leaves me free of that consideration so that after the picture in paris and one additional job of work which is in early spring i can do as much theatre for as long as i wish anywhere in the world interviewer can we expect you next season in the theatre poitier you can very well expect me next season interviewer there is something on the way poitier there are some things being talked about i do want to go on the stage but not to the exclusion of films i want but see simply if you are offered one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a job thats an awful lot of money and they give it to you and the government gets sixty thousand dollars your agent gets fifteen thousand dollars thats seventyfive thousand dollars the state of california gets three or five and the state of new york gets and this gets and that gets so you wind up with about thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars now the forty thousand dollars if you live at a clip of ten thousand dollars a year lasts you four years but if you have one hundred fifty thousand dollars and the government permits you to spread that money and you take twenty thousand dollars a year thats seven and a half years then you do another film for the same company and you stretch the seven and a half years to fifteen then you work for another company and you take ten for fifteenyou see interviewer i know you rejected a role in a filmthat phenix city story roleand i wanted to know a little more about why you rejected it poitier the role was a cheat in the context of what the film dealt with the part was a cheat and a compromise it was a lie an absolute outandout lie and they used it in an uncourageous manner it was the part of a young negro father during the political and criminal holocaust in phenix city alabama or phenix city somewhere in the south and its an open city gambling and corruption and this father because he worked for somebody or did something his daughter was killed and thrown on the lawn and the father goes out hunting for the killer and toward the end of the film he comes across him and hes got him in a shed and hes gonna kill him and they put in his mouth the most ugly compromise if it were an honest change of heart the man had it could have been beautiful because it would have shown great growth you see but they put in his mouth such crappy words like i suddenly realize that the lord doesnt want me to do this interviewer and they wouldnt change it to meet your ideas poitier i was at that time a sevenhundredfiftydollar actor for the whole thingyou know three weeks for the seven hundred fifty dollars i was making two hundred dollars a week or three hundred dollars a week interviewer what has been your favorite role poitier my favorite there is no such thing interviewer then which was the most challenging role lets put it that way and why poitier again there is no such thing there is no easy part to play really i used to think there was but there isnt during the work every part even when youre having a miserable time is an important part because it is a challenge to you whatever the extenuating circumstances aresuch as a bad director or a disinterested group of fellow actors the product the finished product becomes a challenge because you have a job of work that has to be done that has to be good and you know that you can work good so that each job has to like be up to snuff you know you must notch up another so however you feel about the part there is that kind of sense ofyou do what you have to do and if you fail its sickening so each parteven the ones that you look back in retrospect and say i didnt like itat least the working on it was as honest as any other there is no enthusiasm for a part only when you have no interest in the play you see and i dont work like that i work with enthusiasm because i am interested in the things i do and when i work at it i work as fully as i can interviewer you said before that its important for the artist to experience and to live do you make it your business for instance to study people of all colors and races do you return to harlem to refresh your memory and experience of what life in harlem is like do you go out to chicago or go down south to keep in touch with the problems and experiences of people of your race poitier i do not only with people in harlemi go to harlem almost every day i have friends there and i am there almost every day i go in two guises i go as myself and sometimes i goi go as anonymously as i can and its an experience but its a very rewarding one it keeps me alive in certain areas of my consciousness let me explain harlem to you in harlem i am not a stranger nor am i a
did the south win the civil war by howard n meyer t he initial phase of the civil war centennial commemorative program had its climax on april at charleston s c with a national assembly of participating organizations the opening sale of a u s postage stamp designed to mark the firing on fort sumter and the dedication of a monument to the southerner who fired the first shot at his countrys flag a century ago the commission which is presiding over the commemorative program was quietly created in by a congress dominated by southern democrats its membership was appointed by president eisenhower vicepresident nixon and house speaker sam rayburn this group has arranged the details of a fouryear historical pageant the importance of which cannot be overlooked it will influence tremendously the attitude of millions of young americansespecially school childrentoward the war its causes and its effects one is first tempted to say that the commissions plans have been marked by a kind of equal treatment reverence as much for the stars and bars as for the stars and stripes honor as much for jefferson davis as for abraham lincoln tributes for the boys in gray as much as the boys in blue equality that is for all except the negro but actually the union hasnt received equal treatment there was a reenactment of lincolns inaugural and thats all on the confederate side there has been a celebration of the shots fired on the star of the north a u s naval relief ship for sumter a recreation of the confederate constitutional convention and a week of festivities to celebrate the memory of the inauguration of jefferson davis with the man and the hour pageant with a cast of antebellum style shows and mansion tours commemoration ball costume all this was happily announced under the signature of general u s grant iii chairman of the commission and grandson of the soldier who crushed the rebellion chairman grant is eighty years old and apparently still accepts the ideology that prevailed during his turnofthecentury youth that northsouth reconciliation is more important than the human rights of the negro the relationship of the civil war to civil_rights is of course intimate ironic and tragic yet it was privately decided in the centennial planning to suppress all reference to the moral and political issues at stakeand decided one had thoughtin the war the commission revealed in a report to congress in which went unchallenged that the heirs of the secessionists in the state governments of the south were to control the ideological content of all ceremonies such observances should not be directed from washington they should spring into being in response to the wish of the people in each political subdivision the result was that as may be seen in the plans unfolding now only military events and human tragedy are to be commemorated not the extension of american liberty to all men the commissions policies are accurately expressed in its only widely distributed publication a booklet for public information called facts about the civil war this slickpaper twocolor brochure in which the stars and bars of the confederacy on the inside front cover dominates the stars and stripes only slightly resembles nothing so much as a souvenir program for a northsouth stadium extravaganza there is even a section describing the military forces of under the caption the starting lineups it is what the brochure does not say however rather than what it does that is most important a man from mars or stanleyville or vientiane after reading the twenty pages of this factpacked product of the commission would not know that the war was about anything the word negro is not used nor is it mentioned that human slavery was involved in the conflict although the brochure offers a compendium of every conceivable type of statistic about the war the reader will not learn that negro soldiers made up twelve per cent of the victorious northern army and that they sustained eighteen per cent of the union fatalities there is no mention in the nine pages of detailed statistical summary of the hundred and twenty negro infantry regiments nor of the twentytwo negro artillery regiments nor of the seven negro cavalry regiments that helped defeat the rebellion until a quarter of a century ago there would have been nothing surprising about the choice of values made by the commission even today many school textbooks throughout the country are oriented to blame an unnecessary civii war on the abolitionists and to rationalize the secession as forced by the fanaticism of northern statesmen like charles sumner it is not often mentioned that the negro wanted freedom and that he helped to fight for it then too the conventional textbook blames the postreconstruction subjugation of the southern negro on the victim who was ignorant and did not know what to do with freedom all this is a byproduct of the white souths counterattack which by had completed an ideological conquest of the north and a socioeconomic reconquest of the southern negro this postwar conquest by the white south seemed impregnable until a few short years ago the herald of its certain and final defeat was the desegregation decision of the supreme court of which wiped out the memory of an earlier courts acceptance of jim crow but while segregationwith all its implicationshas been defeated and is in retreat it has not surrendered and the harsh fact of everyday life in the deep south is that the white minority favoring resistance to the authority of the united states and rebellion against the constitutional warrant of the supreme court still rules attempts to bring about a token beginning of compliance with the courts ruling have been brought to a standstill in virginia the presence of a governorcongressman from that state as vicechairman of the centennial commission may in part prehaps account for the makeup of the following portion of the description given in the chairmans name of the nature of the centennial what will the civil war centennial be like it will last four years battles will be reenacted many on a huge scale colorful ceremonies will be held exhibitions of war trophies and mementos organized there will be memorials parades new historical markers and a great many special ceremonies virginia which played so great a role in the war is building a centennial center at richmond the capital of the confederacy and restoring and marking its historic battlefields one of the most famous is that of bull run next summer the sights and sounds of the yearold battle will be recreated some men will restage the battle for an audience that will include the president the governor of virginia and many other dignitaries general lees memorable cry will once more ring out over that historic field there stands jackson like a stone wall rally behind the virginians the stone wall of it might be said is one that keeps little children out of the schools that the constitution has been held to entitle them to attend for it has been estimated that if school desegregation continues at the pace of the last seven years it will take four thousand years before every child in the south is placed in a schoolroom to which access is organized in conformity with federal constitutional requirements that creeping pace is determined now by those in the south who have seceded from obedience to court rulings and the plans of the centennial commission to date are aid and comfort to them as only one example is it mere coincidence that it was in montgomery alabama that the most elaborate and prolonged ritual in observance of the birth of the confederacy was staged in february and that martial law was needed to protect a meeting in a negro church in may a federal body appointed to consider how to mark the one hundredth anniversary of the war of emancipation should have been aware of the historical role of the cult of the confederacy as propagandacamouflage behind which was completed the defeat of reconstruction and the degradation of the negro in the late nineteenth century the object of the cult was to bring about the acceptance of a threepart myth that the south fought nobly for an ideal that deserved the blood shed for it that the old south laid waste by the war was a fine romantic noble place and that the romantic noblemen who lived there did more for their slaves than the latter could or ever would do for themselves the fable of the old south and the myth of the lost cause were dissected a few years ago by professor c vann woodward of johns hopkins in his origins of the new south he explored the economic links between the converted whigs of the postreconstruction new south and the northern industrial republicans of the gilded age who invested there in connection with that alliance one of the most significant inventions of the new south was the old southa new idea in the eighties and a legend of incalculable potentialities shortly after the war the louisville courierjournal said the bonny blue flag is the symbol of nothing to the present generation of southern men the southern confederacy went down forever fifteen years ago its issues and ensigns went down with it a few years later however jefferson davis was resurrected from his political exile to help mend the fences of a corrupt local politician in georgia he was borne up and down his old dominions to a continuous ovation the lost cause was then retrieved from historys discard to become a way of life in the united daughters of the confederacy was organized in the capital of the new south atlanta only then when the movement was taken into custody by southern womanhood did the cult of the lost cause assume a religious character monuments were planted in courthouse squares usually the figure of a soldier facing north gun in hand the success of southern apologists meant not merely that the confederate side of the war was hygenized and glamorized the cause of the north was correspondingly demeaned moreover it was consistent with the needs of the exploding postwar economy of the east that there should be distorted and suppressed the meaning of the most humanistic and progressive period of american political thought the period of abolitionism and transcendentalism of the underground railroad and brook farm was swept under the rug it is part of that development that when one thinks today of the word abolitionist one associates it with fanatic or zealot accordingly such figures as william lloyd garrison wendell phillips charles sumner and yes thaddeus stevens have been cruelly dealt with these men form a noble part of our national heritage and it is not a matter of sectional pride that raises the point the rebels may have manufactured the myth of the old south but it was the yankees who accepted it the new south wanted the moral significance of abolition to be forgotten but it was the new north that did the forgetting the guilty responsibility for the century of deferral of true emancipation of the negro is heavy enough to be shared through all america including those of us of immigrant stock who accepted from the nineties to the fifties the tainted gift of white supremacy as a compensation for our own secondclass citizenship when john jay chapman spoke at coatesville pennsylvania in in memory of a particularly brutal lynching of a year before he traced its roots to the wickedness of all america and of three hundred yearsthe wickedness of the slave trade all of us are tinctured by it no special place no special persons are to blame the crime of the southern redeemers who overthrew the reconstruction governments was shared by the northern conservatives who had tired of the negro by and left him to his terrible fate the civil war should be commemorated but not in a manner that drains it of all meaning in military dumb shows and not in a manner which emboldens those guilty today of offenses identified with the secession lincolns second inaugural address closed with an appeal for malice toward none and charity for all but it did establish what the conflict was about one eighth of the population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged there was courage and devotion and tragedy on both sides during the civil war it does not detract from the magnificent heroism of the men of the south nor does it deny the sacrifice of its women to insist that the cause that was lost was founded on an evil one does not have to deny the tragedy of blasted homes and lives to say that the old south depended on an iniquitous social system that could not be tolerated in america it does not serve america well in the world of to ignore the evil and iniquity of slavery in marking the centennial of the conflict our country is still tom at home and dishonored abroad because of the victory snatched from the jaws of reconstruction by the side that had lost the war that victory was the establishment of the prerogative of the former slave states to impose segregation in place of chattel slavery as the basis of race relations james m dabbs the southerner who heads the southern regional the gar the union veterans organization that eisenhower had often saluted those who wore one uniform and fought under one flag fought for their country and were right while those who wore the other uniform and fought under the other banner fought against their country and were wrong no sentimentality and no commercial efforts to efface these radical differences should be encouraged by any true patriot a similar thought had occurred to the founding fathers of they had provided in article iii of the constitution that treason against the united states shall consist in levying war against them when the firing on fort sumter was reenacted in a setting of live oaks and magnolias who was there to remind the playactors in ever so small a voice that the original shot was after all treason all here and now his voice was soft and gentle and yet there seemed to be steel hidden away somewhere in it it was courteous and full of appeal and yet there was something grim and frightening in it every word used was full of meaning and seemed to carry a deadly earnestness thus nehru described the spectacular novel protest of gandhis satyagraha movement against the repressive rowlatt acts in india in his tribute to gandhi is now an apt description of the american negros protest through various forms of nonviolent action against an oppressive culture dominated by whites until satyagraha the use of soul force and truth force in nonviolent noncooperative protest against oppression was unknown in india in satyagraha gandhi combined concepts of peaceful civil disobedience from thoreau and tolstoi and added his own contribution by applying these concepts successfully to political relationships gandhi developed his ideas and methods in south africa and then brought them to india he introduced a new kind of i warfare a warfare which renounced hostility against human beings but which used nonviolent weapons against injustice twentyeight years later due partly to the coercive power of the gandhian technique of nonviolent resistance british rule ended in india since satyagraha is the method now being used by american negroes against racial oppression we must understand this movement for what it is in the first place it is obvious that negroes in the movement refuse to retaliate in kind or to do violence to human life it is less obvious but equally true that they do not use verbal violence or yield to hatred they seek justice and rely heavily on a silent appeal to the conscience of the oppressor the power of this method when it is applied in a society which gives even lip service to christian faith should not be underestimated the negro is fighting and effectively he is deliberately breaking local laws and violating local customs which demean his dignity and deprive him of the rights and benefits guaranteed by a higher law he is doing so in the hope that such disobedience will eventually compel the white man to grant him justice he is courting unjust imprisonment as a means of laying upon the conscience of the nation his legitimate claim to full citizenship he is reluctantly but voluntarily suffering assaults by white ruffians in the confidence that justice will be returned to him for his suffering his warfare is soft and gentle but there is steel hidden away somewhere in it it is courteous and full of appeal and yet grim and frightening this is not a passive but an active protest which rejects violence but is nevertheless coercive which renounces hatred and hostility but is nevertheless aggressive and compelling the negro protest is militantly nonviolent satyagraha has come to america such warfare thus defined and limited is just regrettably necessary and potentially successful most americans find it grim and frightening obviously it is painful and terrifying to southern racists who have never met such opposition before and do not know how to cope with it what can be done to men and women who endure beatings welcome imprisonment and are willing to die if necessary for a just cause the negros nonviolent action is also frightening to the moderates who have been willing to champion the humble negroat least verballybut who are now confronted for the first time by the novel spectacle of a proud selfconfident negro who knows what is his and serves notice that he intends to take it the negros nonviolent protest if not frightening is certainly grim business for its leaders they know or should that there are two perils which always accompany the successes of such a movement first the nouveau proud having won for themselves a legitimate selfconfidence must resist the temptation to let pride deteriorate into vanity and haughtiness they must do so not to cajole the white man but to retain that ingredient of selfsurrender which is indispensable to the continuing success of a nonviolent crusade second there is always the danger that a nonviolent movement through exasperation over delayed successes will get out of hand and become a violent movement that a bloodless revolution will become a bloody one on three occasions between and gandhis followers inadequately disciplined in the techniques of satyagraha resorted to mob violence doing harm to human life and to their own cause on each occasion gandhi called off his nonviolent crusade over the objections of his closest associates and did personal penance through fasting for the violence of his people the same peril with even more disastrous consequences faces the peaceful rebellion of american negroes if the ranks of those who resist oppression in nonviolent action are infiltrated by negroes and whites who are not disciplined in peaceful resistance or if the negroes desert wise leadership and resort to the violence preached by the black muslims justice and freedom for the negro in america will suffer a profound reversal it is a grim and frightening business for the nation when the negro has to launch what is nothing less than a peaceful revolution in order to claim what the laws of the i country guarantee to all its citizens the shame and the weakness of the nation are exposed and its soli j darity is threatened the enemies of the united states do not need to fabricate scurrilous propaganda in order to discredit the intentions of the united states in its dealings with the colored peoples of the world they need only to report in the congo in laos in venezuela what has actually happened in alabama mississippi and louisiana the most devastating propaganda circulated against the united states from moscow and peking is written in the deeds done in the deep south and in the racial ghettos of northern cities the naive pompous assertion that it does not matter what the rest of the world thinks about the united states is refuted each day in the news from africa asia and latin america and most of all the negros nonviolent revolution should be a grim warning to white christian churches james t mccain south carolina field secretary for the congress of racial equality recently declared that the emancipation proclamation freed the negro physically the supreme j court decision freed him men j segregated public schools unconstitutional only per cent of the negro children attend desegregated schools in an area encompassing southern and border states and the district of columbia four of these states defy the supreme court decision altogether and five make only a token compliance gradualism is a science in which southern legislators and southern courts are extraordinarily proficient therefore the negro through sitins and freedom rides leapfrogs local laws and prejudiced local courts on his way toward civil_rights which national laws have assured him the negro has waited years for his proclaimed emancipation to become a reality he is no longer in a waiting mood he wants all that belongs to him and he wants it here and now a revolution is under way in this country beginning in the south it may spread wherever injustice reigns how long it will last and whether it will be peaceful depends on the dedication and discipline of negroes on the willingness of the white south to surrender repressive customs and nullify oppressive laws on the capacity of the american people to recognize in time how urgent it is that all americans be permitted to rise to the full dignity of liberty and equality the partys over at border state schools by larry whiteside sk the average coach at a nonnorthern major college or university and hell usually tell you quite bluntly give me some good negro ball players and ill give you a winning team conceited as it may sound there is a lot of truth in that statement if you base your judgment on the heavy recruiting that major schools all over the country are doing in the negro ranks these days truth however is a precise word discovered only after examining all the facts and more and more coaches are learning we regret to report that the mere presence of negroes on a major college team is not the only ingredient of a winning combination major colleges were once very cautious when they recruited a negro athlete they stuck with the super stars and because of that a host of great athletes became legends in their own lifetimes start a list of legendary negro athletes and you could go on and on duke slater jesse owens ralph metcalfe jackie robinson marion motley buddy young wilt chamberlain oscar robertson etc the list could grow at every thought these men proved to the world that the negro athlete could hold his own with anyone often theirs was a lonely and thankless fight but they made their point now almost every major college except those of the deep south aims its recruiting program at promising young negro athletes with hopes of that allimportant winning team but like dr frankenstein these colleges may have in the making a monster situation which can run out of control unless some serious thinking is doneand soon recruiting the superstar was no problem he was usually the only negro on the team and was treated more or less royally he was the negro star on a team of white players few gave it more thought than that but today the partys over for the superstar and the time has come for nonnorthem schools and northern schools too to realize that problems resulting from the presence of a large number of negroes on a team are cropping up and must be solved now generally speaking the problem reminds one of the old riddle wherein a man looks at identical chickens and is told to pick six good ones and a half dozen of the other kind similarlv coaches y are faced with the problem of choosing between one or many negro athletes it poses the question for him of how many players are too many and how few are not enough public opinion being what it is he has to be extra careful less he be branded a pioneer for having too many and prejudiced for having too few in many areas of the country the problem is small iowa for instance had nine negro starters at one time on its football team last season and was quite successful eastern schools have been dotted with negro talent for years and most of the top track schools can band together a crack allnegro relay unit these however are generally northern or western schools where little trouble is expected anyway the nonnorthem but not particularly southern school is the new proving ground and is where the greatest work must be done kansas a border state lying between the liberal north and the traditional south provided an excellent example of some of the problems that can develop it is a nonnorthem school in a state rich in the history of pioneering for civil_rights the first negro basketball player in the the big eight conference lavannes squires was a kansan and it produced what many people still claim was the biggest of the super basketball stars wilt chamberlain last season the jayhawks fielded a team with seven negroes on it it was a far cry from the days when wilt the stilt hit the scene wilt came to kansas like a meteor that glared brightly almost blinding the people of that farm state with his skill and then suddenly sputtering so quickly as to leave them breathless he was a superstar in the purest sense of the word and probably had more influence than any other player on the thinking of the people of the southwest about accepting negro athletes while the dipper was there the conference was stormy and exciting he was a huge sevenfoot negro who loomed as a tower of strength on any floor he appeared racially he was abused misused misunderstood loved and hated throughout his abbreviated career but he held his ground for three years and took whatever he had to until the lure of big money and professional ball lured him away from kansas in the start of his senior year few big northern athletes had gone to nonnorthern major universities up to that time after chamberlain there would be many to follow up until then the big eight picked its negro stars from the near midwest and the south this all changed after chamberlain left and negroes on conference as well as other southwestern teams are becoming commonplace but ironically kansas the school that started it all wound up last season having the most trouble ku had seven negroes on its basketball team including wayne hightower a much sought after prep allamerican who as a junior was rated by many as the outstanding allaround player in the big eight a correll and ralph heyward two former prep allamericans from philadelphia were on the roster as was bill bridges an allbig eight center and workhorse of the team two sophomores nolen ellison and jim dumas gave kansas two local allstate standouts and butch ellison brother of nolen was one of kansas outstanding junior college players before enrolling at ku here were seven stars from such varied states as kansas new mexico and pennsylvania of the white players only two de ketchum and jerry gardner appeared capable of matching the talents of these negro athletes the nine of them gave kansas what most observers called the best talent in the league everything in fact seemed right for a great year the coaches thought so even the players agreed that kansas would be tough to beat but these rich hopes never materialized and the bubble began to burst even before the season started kansas lost the preseason christmas tournament after being a heavy favorite after that people began to have doubts and made no secret in expressing them they started asking embarrassingbut then timely questions were there too many negroes on the team was there dissension among white and negro players did the coach play favorites whats wrong with kansas at midseason when heyward was lost because of scholastic difficulties the very serious and academic question finally popped upwas kansas sacrificing its standards with these negro players to build a winning team as the teams fortunes grew worse the abuse heightened the school nickname soon changed from jayhawks to blackhawks the racial taunts heretofore unnoticed picked up with such intensity until it provided the spark needed to start the yearly brawl at the kansasmissouri game in columbia mo kumu fights have been going on long before either school had negroes but to a nationwide tv audience not familiar with the situation a racial fracas was what it looked like the only persons who could accurately answer those questions were coach dick harp and the players their views often differed harp considered one of the big eights warmest coaches took issue with those who criticized him we knew we had seven negro players but we didnt think it would cause any problem we tried to get the best ball players available but had no intentions of sacrificing the standards of the university to build a winning team people talked about dissension on our team but if there was i surely didnt see it our kids i think realized who should be playing and if there was any resentment it was no more than you would normally have from any player who in his opinion thought he should be in the lineup more during the season in fact no one even approached me or questioned me on the subject though im sure there was some dissatisfaction for the players angle one would naturally turn to hightower the teams superstar a graduate of philadelphias overbrook high school the same school that produced chamberlain he was a handpicked replica of wilt and was expected to bring kansas the one thing the dipper had failed to do a national title there were many similiarities about the two men both came to kansas with big reputations to live up to both took command of any floor they were on and tried to be the center of attention both were crowd pleasers and high scorers both were aloof from the rest of the student body a great deal of the time both caught hell in every game home or away the similarity has to end there for unlike wilt hightower had a temper and proved moody on and off the court he developed from a mild freshman to the stormy character of his junior year and quit at the end of the school year hightower never caught the fans favor as did chamberlain especially after he privately and publicly avowed his dislike of the state with him as leader kansas fans complained that they couldnt identify themselves with the team a rebel by nature hightower displayed what most people called a lack of humility on and off the court and this often caused him more grief they preferred bridges the new mexicoborn center who kept his mouth shut and hustled all game but as the superstar hightower best could speak of the problems faced for he knew them well perhaps better than the whole group combined none of us expected to see so many negroes on the team wayne stated and though we liked playing together it put a lot of pressure on us all the time we had to win because if we lost people wouldnt say kansas got beat they would say the negroes lost again right away they started looking for excuses and reasons for the losses other than that we simply got beat i personally didnt mind playing with a lot of negroes but it left us all open to much abuse especially the racial insults we traveled in the southwest where people had never seen so many negroes on a team we had trouble almost everywhere we played at missouri in that final game they spat on us and called us names so much that we had to fight i couldnt understand those kind of people to me they were like animals thus a sad fact evolved this nonnorthem area apparently objected to a negrodominated team representing them the people would never admit it but perhaps the shock was too great for many of the people who migrated here from southern states cold cash facts indicate that this experiment cost kansas home attendance fell off from the season that year kansas drew an estimated cage fans into allen fieldhouse in with the blackhawks as the chief drawing card it drew only in games by comparison chamberlain as the lone super star had over fans flock to see him play in for a school with the second largest seating capacity in the nation this dropoff was a bitter pill to swallow j the side effects were almost lethal for a state university white athletes freely passed around the suggestion that kansas preps enroll at rival kstate because ku i preferred northern negro talent and that unless they were allamerican they would get no chance to play j when hightower quit it had a j negative effect on several promising negro prospects who declined scholarships figuring that if hightower couldnt make it the school j must be too tough now because of hightowers departure a poor freshman crop two dropouts and graduation kansas is at a point where it could finish in the conference cellar for the first time in its long history kansas learned much from its experience with chamberlain and the blackhawks for it saw firsti hand some of the problems a non northern school can run into especially if its schedule takes it into i a southernthinking area it learned the meaning of the word trouble as the negro athlete has used it for years and how it goes further than the namecalling kansas learned the traditional meaning of trouble which saw its team split on road trips with negro players staying at private homes or nearby negro colleges they saw their negro players rebuffed at restaurants theaters stores and public transportation to combat this coaches joined northern schools in insisting that their players eat and live together even if it meant giving up the plush hotel for a college dormitory but more than anything else kansas coaches became acquainted with the pattern of negro life and learned of a kind of trouble which they couldnt stop but must have some control of in reflecting the kansas situation of last season perhaps this blowup was the thing needed to bring to light something every negro athlete should realize especially those planning to attend the nonnorthern major college or university if present recruiting trends continue the day of the negro superstar is over true there will be negro allamericans and stars in every sport but few can hope to attain the same status of the superstar of old the first negro novelty is wearing off in most areas of the country and the sooner negroes realize this the better like northern areas theyre becoming just another good ball player and should expect to be treated as such chamberlain was a superstar by himself supreme on the floor with things pretty much the way he wanted it hightower was a superstar to the writers and the other coaches to the school and its fans he was just the best of a good group of negro players and that appears to be the fate of any one of several negroes on a team allamerican rating or not for the northernborn negro today who plays at a nonnorthem school he must prepare himself for what is surely to come the namecalling and other racial taunts often done on purpose with the full knowledge that the negro player will explode will continue as long as people find there is a need for them harold hunter head coach of the allnegro tennessee state university which ended the season as the nations no ranked small college team upi poll is a realist along these lines his schedule last season included only four allnegro schools hunter advocated stronger discipline for negro players on white teams as a possible solution you take a boy from a big city where he has been a star and right away he wants to have his own way in stead of doing what he is told coaches nowadays have a way of taking too much off the city boy instead of treating him like any other player the thing that impressed me about oscar robertson at cincinnati was that despite the fact that they gave him almost everything we wanted he still remained a team ball player and followed his coachs advice thats what made him a great college player kansas coach harp along these same lines was firm in what he believed should be the negro athletes goal at kansas we pride ourselves on building leadership and this i think should be the goal of every negro athlete going to college everyone i feel recognizes the ability of our negro athletes our purpose as a university is not to build better athletes but better young men who will lead our country and in their particular case their people a boy should come to college to develop leadership and not just to play basketball or some other sport if he doesnt i think hes missing the entire purpose of his education to the young negro athlete we can only offer this advice pick your schools northern or otherwise with care and with the realization that all that glitters is not gold nonnorthern schools for the negro today are for the most part excellent kansas university the model of most of this article is an excellent nonnorthern school with a fine reputation all nonnorthern schools however have some problems which in the coming years will cease to exist but for now must be at least realized by the prospective athlete one should always remember that at most nonnorthern schools some negro has already paved the way and a close check will probably reveal little ill effects a special kind of courage by alice reid much her graygreen eyes stared steadfastly back at her as she combed out her dark cloud of hair and arranged it decorously behind her shellpink ears and secured the tiny pearl earrings her dress a pale blue cotton with a full skirt and a puritan collar lay on the bed waiting she slipped it on over her neat head carefully and buttoned the little white buttons that marched sturdily up the bodice to look as neat and gentle as possible to meet his parents and his sisters and his brothers she was a birchslim tall girl and the chocolate colored hair belled gloriously about her tender throat he was even taller than she she could wear her new patent heels fright made her hands wet and beaded her upper lip shall they like me she wondered for the millionth time please let them want me he and she sat near each other in psychology ii and a mutual college friend had introduced them from then on they had needed no one listened to no one i only need you he had told her do you want me enough she had pushed back her dark hair and looked up into his clear dark eyes her own eyes wide with the emotion she felt yes she had said to him simply i need you very much it wont be easy he had said but she had merely touched his mouth with her fingers letting her steady eyes say it all for her it was like that with them they regarded one another with tenderness she sat now like a little girl primly careful of her dress on the mourners bench that squatted on the front porch of her college boarding house and waited for him to come as he handed her into the battered waxed and polished little coupe she noted with elation how handsome he looked in his gray flannel suit he had his hair clipped painfully short and he wore a bluish colored necktie and he was nervous she could tell for his manner was taut and he spoke her small name brusquely but he had smiled at her and her heart began to glow the sunday afternoon streets had that lonely subdued sunday look they passed a few humans watering lawns or aimlessly walking she watched the empty streets with interest wondering where all the people went on the long sunday afternoons she could not look at him they were letting the world in today and at this time when they should have been so close seeking solace and strength each from the other she could not even look at him her brother had told her bluntly for you it is a combination of new freedom and suddenly being exposed to all these liberal college groups youll get your balance back most of us do go ahead get it out of your system but dont jump to conclusions too fast and dont you let yourself do anything you cant file away and forget he had been very amused and understanding and tolerant about it after all he had added for emphasis i went through it myself youll actually learn from it if you keep your values intact he had made her quite angry as juliet must have felt when her family disparaged her romeo she had lifted her chin and felt ready to fight hurricanes she had wanted to fly into the worlds prosy face and smack it with her little fist the streets began to change there were stores and cafes and taverns the traffic was heavier he turned down a side street the houses were all tall and ancient gingerbread decorated the dingy gables there were people sitting in the fading sunlight and the shrill screams of playing children he led her up a neat walk up many wooden steps to stand before a wide old door with stained glass windows he opened it and she passed through she smelled food hot heavy food cooking hard there were people here also in this oldfash ioned parlor their dark wary wise eyes chilled her as she went at his side from one to the other smiling unsure and diffident he put her into a big chair and the scene blurred into kaleidoscopic confusion a sister which one sat beside her talking about college his mother brought her a slice of delicious chocolate cake and a cup of steamy lemony tea the mothers eyes were as cold as bits of unburned anthracite though her mouth was sweetly parted in a smile the brothers devoured her with quick glances and shoved each other a little for her benefit j he came to sit alongside her after a bit but his nearness did not help she thought of her mothers cool house of quiet uncluttered rooms of warmth of belonging acceptance of smiling eyes of back grounds and childhoods she remembered the loving arguments that had bored her so terribly but it was a giant step and suppose she was too immature and yet she was in love with him she was wasnt she they did not stay long he pleaded a party that they were to attend and she promised to come back soon and when they stood outside at last she was amazed to see that it was night in the battered waxed and polished coupe she put a hand gently so gently over his clenched fist that clasped the steering wheel and when she looked at him she had her answer we dont have the courage she thought sadly it takes a special kind of courage and the compassionate way that he suddenly took her white hand into his brown one told her all that she needed to know bert williams the modern pagliaccio by walter monfried t he contribution of negroes to american theater and music has been enormous the number of their gifted actors singers dancers bandsmen and entertainers runs into the hundreds until recently however they have not been prominent in the field of comedy but now a group of bright younger men headed by dick gregory of st louis is showing marked ability in that field too gregory a monologist of clever wit and shrewd observation is being called the finest negro comedian since bert williams to couple the name of gregory with that of bert williams is the highest of compliments williams nearly years after his death is ranked among the finest of comedians of any color the funniest man i ever saw the late w c fields said of williams and he added the saddest man i ever knew edward b marks a long time song publisher and sage of show business asserted that no comedian ever surpassed bert in facial expression and pantomime he equaled the greatest of clowns chaplin at his best could hold an audience no better in his slow mournful delivery of a song bert was a raconteur without parallel each song was a mood or an anecdote and you never missed a nuance of feeling master of the single williams tall and handsome was threesixteenths negro and his skin was so light in color that he blackened it for the stage a man of wide reading and cultivated voice he had to speak in the traditional southern drawl expected of a negro entertainer as douglas gilbert the historian of vaudeville points out the printed description hardly provides a faint idea of the williams mastery as a singlethe marvelous face work the expressions of wonder and disdain the vocal drollery the unexpected rises and falls of inflection where im living now is a nice place but you have to go along a road between two graveyards to get to it one of his favorite monologs went one night last week i was coming home kind of late and i got about halfway home when i happened to look over my shoulder and saw a ghost following me i started to run i run till i was most ready to drop and then i looked around but i didnt see no ghost so i sat down on the curbstone to rest then out of the corner of my eye i could see something white and when i turned square around there was that ghost sitting along side of me the ghost says that was a fine run we had it was the best running i ever saw and i says yes and as soon as i get my breath youre going to see some more poker hand classic williams was equally admired for the way he could put over songs including youve got the right church but the wrong pew my castle on the nile not for me the jonah man all goin out and nothin cornin in why dont you get a lady of your own and above all the humorouspathetic nobody delivered deliberately with eloquent pauses i aint never done nothing to nobody iaint never got nothin from nobodyno time anduntil i get somethin from somebody sometime i dontintend to do nothin for nobodyno time his fans never wearied of his silent miming of a poker game alone amid a darkened stage he stood in a spotlight glare only his head shoulders and hands visible holding the cards close to his face he looked eagerly at the draw studied the hand intently placed his bet eagerly looked ever so suspiciously at his fellow sportsmen exulted at the calland relapsed into the losers profound disgust it was rated a classic of vaudevilles happiest era among williams closest friends were ring lardner the gloomy humorist and ashton stevens the chicago stage reviewer lardner and williams were by nature prodigiously untalkative when the former visited the others dressing room they would sit by the hour making a deaf mute seem garrulous by contrast stevens could incite the entertainer to a few more words in his last interview with williams he wrote he was offered a drink this during prohibition and the talk got around to drinking spots the saloon was the only club in which a man of my color could meet a man of your color brother stevens williams related and i like my friends like to be with them id pop my head in a saloon door and not seeing anybody i knew id say in my best london accent sorry i thought mr stevens was here i always said i was waiting for somebody even when i was only waiting for anybodyanybody whod breeze in and say hello bert what you doing here funny what a manll do for human companionship the interviewer asked williams about his forthcoming role im a hotel porter an awful liar but a character was the answer i sing one number with an outcast dog a lady has given me to take the dog out and feed him her husband has given me to take the dog out and drown him theres some problem in that songim working it out slow way i do everything i ought to be able to understand how that old black porter feels yes and he added

moved with his family to riverside calif williams went to school there and wanted to attend stanford university but lacked funds he read good books all his life however schopenhauer mark twain goethe and many others in boyhood williams showed himself a natural at song and mimicry he could imitate the movements and speech of anyone instead of going to the university he picked up an old banjo and became a minstrel in west coast theaters and honkytonks he teamed up with another talented negro entertainer george walker and the actwhich they worked upranked among the finest in vaudevilles heyday they branched out into legitimate with a musical revue called in dahomey which had a huge success in america and was taken to england where it ran for a year king edward vii was a williams fan and in decreed a command performancethe highest honor any foreign actor could attain in england the king liked to chat with the american off stage later williams shows in which many negroes participated were abyssinia and in bandana land in their matchless dialogs williams played the slow witted drawling fall guy to walkers sophisticated sharpie a typical routine walker i could do this alone but im letting you in on it because youre a friend of mine first of all go into the bank and fill this satchel with money williams whose money walker that aint the point we dont know who put the money there we dont know how they got it and they wont know how we got it all you have to do is fill the satchel williams and what do i do with this satchel walker just bring it to me at a place where i tell you williams when they come to count the cash in the bank and find it short what then walker by that time well be far far awaywhere the birds are singing sweetly and the flowers are in bloom williams after long sober reflection and if they catch us theyll put us so far far away we never will hear no birds singin singin and everybody knows you cant smell no flowers through a stone wall the handsome sociable walker who couldnt resist high life and swift women was mortally stricken with paresis around and williams had to go on alone florenz ziegfeld creator of the perennial follies revues admitted that he had no taste for comedy but he recognized the appeal of williams and starred him in several of his shows from on at first other follies performers threatened to strike if they had to appear with him and williams part of the show was cut to his old time vaudeville single routine but the friendliness and artistry of the newcomer won them over and he was accepted as a full fledged colleagueand by audiences too one evening as williams was going to his dressing room he overheard one actor say to another you have to say this for bert williamshe knows his place thats right williams interrupted genially its that room with the star on the door for nearly a decade williams adorned the follies with vaudeville excursions during off seasons and then went into the famous new york winter garden revues the shubert brothers broadways most powerful showmen created a musical comedy under the bamboo tree especially for williams talents in the early she was the only colored member on tour with it he became ill of pneumonia and returned to his new york home where he died at of the many theater critics who exalted williams heywood broun was especially perceptive he conceded that eddie cantor and a jolson supplied excitement vitality and efficiency but the old bert williams gave you more quiet and consolation he found prosperity and success in the theater but his high talents were largely wasted every round of laughter bound him more securely to his estate as merrymaker booker t washington the famous negro educator and reformer did not share this view bert williams has done more for the race than i have he declared he has smiled his way into peoples hearts i have been obliged to fight my way management cracks industry to meet its ever growing needs for management profession and technical personnel has begun to turn to a previously almost untapped source the plus young negroes who are now graduating each year from college and professional schools corporate recruiters long familiar sights on the campuses of the nations universities and colleges now are becoming frequent visitors to the allnegro institutions the best known of these howard university in washington d c is regularly visited by representatives of some leading companies and most of the some negro colleges and universities now are on corporate calling lists major companies already carrying out negro campus recruiting include bell telephone labs boeing columbia broadcasting system general electric ibm north american aviation union carbide corp and western electric typical of companies which have opened higher level employment to negroes is the burroughs corp where according to industrial relations vice president frank g armstrong negroes now serve as sales and service men computer statisticians engineering draftsmen electrical and mechanical engineering designers field site technicians electronic technicians mathematicians and technical editors armstrong testifying at a detroit hearing of the us commission on civil_rights declared that i am happy and not a little proud to say that our corporate policy of employment and promotion on a nondiscriminatory merit basis has been highly successful but he added that there had been a noticeable lack of negro applicants trained to take up skilled technical and professional positions this lack however is being rapidly overcome negro college enrollment multiplied almost eight times between and while all enrollment increased only a little more than three times and doubled from to while all enrollment increased only a company which fails to hire negroes for jobs for which they are qualified is shortchanging itself according to joseph j morrow vice president personnel relations of pitneybowes inc which employs negroes in high level engineering administrative and sales he says negroes consider themselves permanently on trial no matter how long they are with a company the end result is often distinctly superior in both quality and quantity from a purely selfish standpoint an employer who might be reluctant to hire negroes can assure himself that they are good workers a good investment we wouldnt trade our negro employes for anything paralleling and backstopping the opening up of higher level negro employment by business and industry itself is the federal governments campaign spearheaded by the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities to end all discrimination in industry the committee headed by vice president lyndon johnson and labor secretary arthur goldberg is empowered to publicize names of companies holding government contracts and labor unions which fail to eliminate discriminatory practices and to initiate legal action to terminate contracts and bar new ones with companies refusing to end such practices it expects however to achieve its goals by voluntary agreement the committee recently worked out an agreement with lockheed aircraft corp which outlaws all forms of discrimination and segregation throughout the companys nine divisions and provides for active work in the fields of recruitment employment and upgrading of negroes the agreement was hailed by president kennedy as a milestone in the history of civil_rights the presidents brother attorney general robert kennedy recently asserted that election of a negro to the us presidency could come within the next years selection of a negro as board chairman or president of a major corporation might come even sooner spearheading the movement to open the higher levels of employment to qualified negroes is the national urban league whose commerce and industry council has just held a manpower utilization conference in new york attended by representatives of corporations and universities and colleges general and negro albert f waters vice president of general foods corp who presided at the conference stated that business and industry not only for their own sake but for that of the nation as a whole must institute a program parallel to that being carried on by the federal government to attract qualified young negroes to responsible positions he said our meeting is against a severe backdrop which silhouettes its importance internationally the us is in the midst of a cold war race and we cannot afford to waste any of our human resources describing the conference as the first time in us history that so large a group of corporation representatives and education representatives have convened to consider recruitment of collegetrained negroes on a national basis he added while a number of important companies have extended employment in business relating to training and capacities of negro graduates the vast majority of companies have ignored this source of capable manpower news front to find out just what progress negroes actually have made in attaining executive and professional jobs asked of the nations leading corporations their policy on hiring negroes for such jobs and the number they themselves employed in such capacities most companies because of provisions of the new york state and other antidiscrimination laws were reluctant to place themselves on record but the survey did reveal that the proportion of negroes holding such positions is much higher than generally believed and is mounting the survey also made clear however that almost all such jobs fall into the technical professional and staff categories and that few negroes as yet hold corporate positions with direct line responsibility also indicative is the fact that while in only of all employed negroes held professional technical and similar jobs and only office and clerical jobs in the figures had risen to respectively and how to guard against heart attacks every year in the united states the number of people who have heart attacks increases of the hundreds of thousands who suffer an attack more than percent die in the last year for which national health education committee figures are available a total of persons died from heart attacks and other heart diseases men are the principal victims of heart attacks and other cardiovas cularrenal diseases it is estimated that as many as percent of all fatal heart attacks are suffered by men in the age group between and at least twice as many men as women have heart attacks this means that women are likely to have more heart attacks the older they get before menopause the rate of heart disease among women is relatively low according to medical research the female hormone estrogen provides builtin protection for younger women after menopause when the female hormone subsides women become nearly as susceptible to coronary disorders as men heart attacks arteriosclerosis take a greater toll of human life than any other disease it is a killer against which medical science is mustering formidable opposition however to help reduce the high and spiraling heart attack death rate the public must understand heart disease why so many people suffer from it and what can be done about it to begin with it is necessary to know what a heart attack is and to understand what happens it is necessary to know something of the nature and operation of the heart a heart attack is basically hardening of the arteries around the heart the medical term for this condition is arteriosclerosis of the coronary vessels when fatlike substances in the blood accumulate in the walls of the arteries they tend to clog the arteries and block the flow of blood to the heart muscle this causes what is known as a heart attack the fatty substances in the blood comes from the food consumed and they have the dubious distinction of being the only insoluble elements taken into the body this fat consists of many things cholesterol or fatty alcohol is one of the principal substances ordinary butterfat is another while there are other kinds of heart disease arteriosclerotic heart disease is by far the most dangerous and the most serious form of arteriosclerosis is technically known as atherosclerosis or calcification of the arteries resulting in blood clots hypersensitive heart disease is another frequent heart ailment it is caused by high blood pressure which puts an extra burden on the hearts pumping mechanism eventually this extra pressure impairs the hearts ability to function normally still another frequent heart ailment is rheumatic heart disease this form of heart disease occurs most often to persons with a history of rheumatic fever in childhood rheumatic heart disease affects the heart valves primarily but also involves the joints the term growing pains refers to the aches of rheumatic heart disease angina pectoris is a somewhat less serious heart trouble it is chest pain caused by a lack of sufficient blood supply to part of the heart muscle and it is usually temporary rest is the best remedy for it while angina pectoris is not the same as a heart attack they have in common the narrowing of the arteries the difference is that the artery does not completely close with angina pectoris while medical science knows of no certain means of avoiding heart attacks there are three general rules which doctors say will reduce the likelihood of heart disease these are constant and moderate exercise to keep the muscles toned and the blood fat circulating avoiding excessive physical and emotional strain which might make extra demands on the hearts pumping system and guarding against excess weight and too much fat content in the diet taking the first rule exercise it is important to explode some of the myths about it and heart attacks when former president eisenhower suffered an attack in many people thought that his regular excursions to the golf course may have had something to do with his illness but dr irvine h page president of the american heart association brushed this aside he said that if anything a round or two of golf made one less susceptible to heart attacks coronary heart attacks as far as i know dont seem to be any more common on the golf course or the tennis courts than they are when you sit in your office or are home in bed he said dr paul dudley white eminent heart specialist and president eisenhowers physician at the time issued a statement saying that the presidents heart attack had nothing to do with playing golf on the other hand doctors do not advise undertaking exercise of a strenuous or competitive nature if unaccustomed to it this can both overstimulate the heart muscle and bring on fatigue neither of which is calculated to discourage heart attacks as to the high content of fats in the average american diet many scientists believe this largely accounts for the comparatively greater rate of heart disease among americans a study by dr ansel keys director of minnesotas laboratory of physiological hygiene indicated that the american diet was the fattest containing some percent or more of calories from fats compared to this great britain had only about percent and spain and italy a relatively safe to percent heart ailments are not major health hazards in spain and italy figures from the department of agriculture support the belief that the american heart disease ratio has risen in exact proportion to the fat content of the national diet back in when heart disease was a less critical health problem only about percent of the calories in the nations diet came from fats to cut the high heart disease rate among americans dr keys recommends that the proportion of calories from fats be reduced to between and percent this can be done he says without sacrificing basic nutritional needs however the nature of such a diet should be decided by a qualified physician or nutritionist unfortunately there are no surefire signs to warn of an impending heart attack the electrocardiogram for example which measures the electric impulses that an african student looks at america by babs fafunwa this country to study p i have met over fifty african students during my vacations in exchanging views with them i found that most of our impressions after arriving on the american soil are almost identical everything about him the student finds out mobbed by a group of inquiring reporters who ask what is your name where do you come from what is your impression about america how many wives has your father are you married is it true that you buy women in africa are you a prince is your father a king or a gold miner the shooting of flash bulbs adds to the confusion this barrage is an indication of what the student is to experience as he moves from one part of the united states to another one of my most exciting experiences happened when i arrived in new york city on that day it had one of its greatest snowfalls and whats more i had never seen snow in my life that day my heavy overcoat was no solution to my dilemma as i stepped out of the airplane i was baptized with the unusually biting cold i was shaken to the bones and all my limbs were trembling the woman in me subdued the man and my eyes were shedding tears like an arabian gum tree that night i slept in my overcoat suit and all the temperature was f and the lowest temperature i had ever seen in nigeria is till i landed in new york i had never met an american negro my impression was that since the negro has been living there for the past three hundred years or more he ought to have intermarried with the whites so that his color should be at least lighter than my own by the way i am ebony black and id like to be twice as dark but when i landed i saw a negro darker than myself i thought he was an african who came a little earlier than i did i rushed to him with all the happiness and the joy finding a kinsman in this great metropolis i said hello dear when did you come he looked at me with cold surprise i later found that he must have been here three hundred years for his speech is as entirely strange to me as mine to him the student who hails from the british sphere of influence in africa finds on getting here that americas ideas of democracy are in conflict in a way to those of britains the average englishman admits that a lord jim is his better he does not resent his betters nor put himself on an equal basis with them nor does he wish to do so the american on the other hand rejects all ideas of class everybody is hey or say mister the student finds that democracy works fairly well in the north and otherwise in the south he finds in the north that competition is tough but in the south segregation and discrimination i stare him in the face i remember one day when the african students at bethunecook man college in florida were on their way back to school after giving an african program at a church we stopped at a filling station for some refreshments a policeman entered and said where are you niggers from this particular aspect of our social life has been wilfully misrepresented and we hope our american friends will understand we love our women as passionately as the americans and we are not in the habit of illtreating them or regarding them as chattels the first thing an african student is told is that he should get americanized socialize with the girls forego the english wide trousers for the american narrow pants his little coat for the long heavy coat he finds that table manners in america vary considerably from what he had been used to at home he used fork knife spoon etc while the americans use the fork for everything on the table except soup he therefore has to unlearn what he had learned previously and get adjusted to the american way of life but the pity is that he has to unlearn what he is learning now in order to fit into his own pattern on his return home british way to american way back to british way again while at the same time he has to take care of his culture the african way phone it was a gamble famed rev martin l king jr heralded as the man who controlled the minority vote because of his dixie crusading was lodged in a georgia prison and heads of major organizations were demanding that the presidential candidates intervene if they decided to act they could lose the support of whites in key dixie states both presidential candidates last fall studied the situation assessed the gains and the losses vice president nixon refused to take a position the then sen john f kennedy gingerly called the pregnant wife of the civil_rights hero and expressed his interest in their plight this telephone call late last october some political prognosticators argue decided the close presidential election the reasoning is that the slim margin of victory was due to the heavy vote of negroes in strategic northern and southern states up to that time the usually democratic negro voting mass was complacent unmoved by campaign oratory and lacking the spark even to go in numbers to the polls for want of a dramatic and far sweeping attraction for the negro voter the kennedyking phone relay looms as the single headlined incident of the campaign previously there was little difference between the parties as negroes appraised the records of the candidates and the promises on the matter of the negro in the cabinet issue both party standard bearers neatly dodged the point with grandiose statements that qualifications not race should apply to selection of persons to key posts both parties developed after considerable negotiation strong civil_rights planks at the national convention both parties boasted candidates sensitive to civil_rights and to some degree talkative on the specifics but like the politicians they are they refrained from unduly annoying the white voters below the masondixon line on the m l king episode there was the striking comparison despite his proven ability to draw crowds rev king scrupulously refused to become attached to either party or give out statements backing either candidate both parties however wooed him but the overtures became a nightmare when rev king got in trouble revered by negroes for his civil_rights record vice president nixon for the first time in the campaign revealed a shocking indifference refusing to make a statement or in any way become a participant in the rev king case the vice president even ignored the counsel of cabinet members and his three negro advisors white houser e frederic morrow gop minorities chief val washington and exbaseball star jackie robinson also it was brought out and widely publicized that nixon abandoned speaking engagements in negro sections of northern cities and quietly played down civil_rights as a campaign theme it was a grim revelation to many negroes that the government official who traveled to africa and was photographed shaking the hands of tribal villagers and holding black babies turned down the pleas to help one of their leadersfor political advantage aides later said the vice president hoped to carry some southern states and such an intervention thus would have damaged his election plan as could be expected there was a shift in sentimentaided perhaps by the showering of millions of leaflets in negro sections calling attention to the democratic candidates bold action there was a reevaluation of the candidate whose religion still was his main stumbling block in penetrating the highlyprotestant vote bloc there was an overall appraisal of the two candidates on sincerity and devotion to the cause of civil_rights a matter which previously had been taken for granted even the democrats focused the spotlight on topics of employment health and housing and reporters followed through with articles saying that for the first time negro voters were derailing civil_rights as a key item of consideration the first impact of the kennedy intervention in the king case came in philadelphia where thousands of negroes lined the streets and crowded a housing area to hear the young senator it was the first sign of acceptance by negroes in the campaign but kennedy had some difficulties the mikes broke down later in the week west coast negroes jammed an auditorium to hear kennedy and aides knew then that they had finally struck gold how a telephone call could trigger a national reaction not of jubilance or adulation but more of resentment at being misled confounded top democratic party workers but surprised leaders of the hardworking civil_rights section said one democrat this was like getting a homer in the ninth inning with the score tied few incidents in the campaign received such emphasis few statements or episodes were as widely publicized yet the phone call was no sudden act or a performance done in the heat of crusading almost a score of democratic leaders both negro and white memoed the jfk brass suggesting such a move while others buttonholed every ranking party spokesman behindthescenes there was a maddening flurry of activity which built into a storm and even the presidential candidate couldnt ignore it unknown to many rev king first started the chain of events a week before the historic call king wired kennedy urging a probe of the shooting of harry blake a field secretary for his southern christian leadership conference who was shot a few days earlier while leaving a shreveport la meeting kennedy assigned race relations aide frank reeves to investigate the case reeves then made arrangements to meet king at the airport when reeves arrived at the atlanta airport there was no rev king on the welcoming committee to his surprise reeves learned that king was lodged in jail having been arrested for participating with some youngsters in a sitin at a department store king was detained because of a violation of probation stemming from a traffic case rushing to the jail reeves talked with king and promptly dispatched word of the situation to kennedy advising several channels of action at the same time there were other jfk aides who quickly saw the political advantage of interventionif such a move came before the gop candidate spoke out among those who piloted the project were georgia organizer robert troutman civil_rights staffers harris wofford marjorie lawson louis martin and john seigenthaler a former tennessee newspaperman and aide to robert kennedy wofford got in touch with sargent shriver jfks brotherinlaw reeves spread the word from the candidate to members of his brain trust while most of the others streamed memos to brother robert kennedy with such momentum started it is difficult to ascertain the route of eventual action but one factor is clear the idea was born of no single individual because no one was influential enough to convince kennedy to take such a step as it was his brother robert appeared more daring even calling the atlanta mayor and a judge to air his views and urge consideration however when the presidential candidate called mrs king on wednesday october th the phone call blazed across the negro sections of the nation with as much impact as a mississippi lynching yet jfk made no promises or hinted even of subsequent relief in a later press statement mrs king said it certainly made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt senator kennedy said he was very much concerned about both of us he said this must be hard on me he wanted me to know that he was thinking about us and he would do all he could to help us i told him i appreciated it and hoped he would help i had the feeling that if he was that much concerned he would do what he could so that mr king would be let out of jail she concluded with this bombshell i have heard nothing from the vice president or any one on his staff mr nixon has been very quiet if the wifes statement was not designed for political warfare the words of rev kings father were a prominent atlanta minister the senior rev king who described himself as a lifelong republican was quoted as saying i will carry a basket of votes to kennedy his optimism wasnt fulfilled completely despite his and his sons popularity nixon swept every negro precinct in atlanta with a handsome margin yet gop leader william j shaw conceded that the indifference on the part of the partys high command hurt the gop cause among negroes the same opinion was shared by negro gop leaders in other cities for weeks they quietly reaped a harvest of support by spreading the word that the democrats kept vice presidential nominee lyndon johnson a texan and a conservative in civil_rights out of the big northern cities it was no secret that johnson had little appeal for negroes and once reeves had to advise him to keep his wife from talking too much about her good friend her negro maid but even with this campaign asset the gopers realized that the high command had written off the negro vote for the first time there were no leaflets no newspaper ads in weekly papers no crosscountry campaigning compared to other years in other words said a gop topflighter the king case stuck us in the achilles heel it hurt nixon more than it helped kennedy while political experts attribute such importance to the phone call it is a favorable sign of progress in politics the negro vote certainly has come of age but such a conclusion understandably angers the professional democrats who contend the incident has been stretched out of context said one vip if were so childlike that a phone call can change our minds then publicizing this incident is one way to expand the stereotype that negroes arent intelligent voters theyre emotional mambypambies the controversy probably will rage for years but many americans still will remember the election as one won by a man who gambled on a telephone call by hoyt w fuller and doris e saunders metamorphosis of a poet the year was the young woman was margaret walker and the book was called for my people all the agony and heartbreak and hope and incredible strength that characterizes the negro heritage was there her star glittered zoomed she was a graduate of northwestern seeking an advanced degree at iowa then she went away she was heard from at livingstone college in north carolina and then many remembered the bright promising star and asked where is she she was wanted needed her voice had caught the melody sung by wheatley douglass dunbar cullen hughes kept it fresh true last summer the poet now brisk and matronly paid one of her infrequent visits to chicago she is coordinator of the humanities at jackson state college the mother of four the oldest of which a yearold girl enrolled at western university in oxford ohio in september she seemed a happy womanin mississippialthough there have been no recent poems was the voice still had the star been a mere meteorite flashing across the sky on its way to death in the sea of obscurity said miss walker i am working on a prose project have been for years now it will need at least another years work it was answer enough really for one who is an artist but perhaps a better answer lies in her poetry spelling out the conflict between what she is and where she is in sorrow home she wrote my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee i was sired and weaned in a tropic world warm skies and gulf blue streams are in my blood i belong with the smell of fresh pine with the trail of coon and the spring growth of wild onion the poem ends o southland sorrow home melody beating in my bone and blood how long will the klan of hate the hounds and the chain gangs keep me from my own margaret walker is at home and silent the new black by arna bontemps n literature as in life no doubt dominant traits may be expected to reappear in alternate generations just as children may favor their grandparents more than their parents in ways at least young writers sometimes seem to reach back past their immediate predecessors for examples and blood ties with earlier kin thus the newest crop of negro writers in the united states show more traits in common with the writers of the harlem renaissance than with the famous wpa group who were their literary parents so to speak despite the ringing successes of richard wright frank yerby and willard motley bellweathers of the little flock nourished by wpa writers projects and such gifted colleagues of theirs as roi ottley margaret walker and gwendolyn brooks one searches in vain among the newest negro writers today for any who could qualify as their artistic progeny or even as their disciples well almost in vain lorraine hansberry the exciting author of raisin in the sun is in some very fundamental literary ways related to the sturdy author of native son black boy and uncle toms children even the hansberrywright link however which is by no means limited to the way in which they have drawn upon their common chicago background for subject matter is marked by notable differences miss hansberrys star came up unheralded nothing from her typewriter had been published or produced prior to raisin in the sun the critical and popular approval which followed this event made her famous and the rejoicing this occasioned can only be compared to the kudos which followed richard wrights sunburst a little more than a decade earlier but her recognition was based on a play native son was a novel black boy an autobiography uncle toms children a collection of stories and the two authors though they had both spent crucial years of their lives in the chicago jungle if thats the word for the south side of those days were separated by more than just a span of time in their development richard wrights young manhood in chicago was poverty ridden lorraine hansberrys family was welltodo by south side standards her father was in the real estate business he could in a manner of speaking have owned or managed the rental property in which bigger thomas killed the rat with the frying pan how his perceptive daughter came to see the human turmoil in those substandard quarters through eyes of sympathy and deep understanding has not been told miss hansberrys subsequent writing has consisted mainly of articles in periodicals it has not tended toward autobiography a lesser writer one imagines particularly a lesser negro writer in the united states might have been in a hurry given her talents and background to give the world a picture of debutants balls and gracious living to compensate for the ugliness richard wright had forced before the eyes of millions of readers to the embarrassment of our favored few she also avoided the equally unwise assumption that more of the same material that wright had presented would prove to be equally arresting when presented by her equally instructive but it doesnt work that way without the addition of new elements and the new hansberry ingredient was technique in the theatre a medium that demands a maximum of knowhow usually attained only after long and painful apprenticeship years of heartbreaking trial and error she showed up at first bow with complete control of her tools and her craft this was little short of startling selfeducated richard wright had been a toiling sometimes almost awkward manipulator of the devices of composition he had won over this disadvantage by sheer power in lorraine hansberrys case this particular shoe seemed to be on the other foot which of course is as it should be one looks for an increase of technical skills in a second or third generation of writers if any loss in originality or other qualities occurs one expects it to be balanced by greater familiarity with the mechanics thanks to the examples and experiments of the forerunners if this is not a generalization that can be applied to all of the newest crop of negro writers it should be allowances can no longer be made for technical weakness but more striking parallels or kinships as i have ventured appear when the work of the newest negro writers is put beside the product of the ardent young people who came to harlem in the early twenties and created the upsurge of creativity known as the harlem renaissance this was the group that drew from charles s johnson the cautious and careful sociologist the rare exclamation that a brief ten years have developed more confident selfexpression more widespread efforts in the direction of art by negroes in the u s than the long dreary two centuries before in the constellation to which johnson referred jean toomer was the first star his place and influence among the new negroes of the harlem group were like those of ralph ellison today when published by such little magazines as dial broom little review and doubledealer toomers stories and sketches poems and plays delighted the avant garde symbolism with varying levels of psychological and philosophical meaning fascinated him yet his heart belonged to the folk negro charles s johnson thought at first he detected a certain remote link between toomers compositions and the writing of paul laurence dunbar where dunbar gave to the unnamed negro peasant a reassuring touch of humanity toomer gave to the peasant a passionate charm he observed his conclusion was however that toomer was more than an artist he was an experimentalist obviously much of this comment could as well be applied to the talented author of invisible man as to the handsome young wanderer whose cane was a literary sensation in but who soon after turned his back on greatness ellison has not turned his back but he is a slow and painstaking worker invisible man was many years in the writing like cane however it was promptly recognized as a landmark drawing heavily on folk sources reflecting its authors preoccupation with technique and the roots of artistic expression invisible mans critical reception amounted to acclaim it was accepted as a major work a consensus roughly equivalent to that which greeted cane thirty years earlier while one is clearly a novel the other hard to classify by form side by side the two books make a fascinating study a conversation between the two extremely articulate authors should it ever occur would be worth going many miles to overhear invisible man was a bestseller in the year in which it was published it was given the national book award in marking a first in recognition of this type for a negro writer in the united states while it did not reach so wide an audience as richard wright had reached in the forties the reading public was much better prepared for it than it had been for cane only a few hundred copies of which were sold if neither ellison nor toomer became rich as a direct result of these important and significant books both immediately found themselves in demand in circles where the meaning of things are explored both awakened to find that their wellchosen words had suddenly become gospel to a goodly company of inquirers and both entered into secondary careers as occasional essayists discussants and instructors both ellison and toomer reached literature after an initial interest in music both have shown a probing interest in the common sources of creative expression even in their personal lives certain parallels may be detected but there are also significant differences and these may account for the crucial decision each eventually made ellison to write invisible man toomer to become invisible an authors looks have little if anything to do with his writing but some people who have known them both have not failed to observe that james baldwin is the spitnimage of wallace thurman when baldwin speaks and especially when he laughs the resemblance becomes so striking it almost makes one wonder about incarnation thurmans early death in the fading days of the harlem renaissance was one of two quick tragedies by which some of the participants have dated the passing of that period in the last five years of his life however thurman saw experienced and wrote a great deal he was no exception indeed he was conspicuous for it in a group that believed that poetry and prose were things you might live as well as write this was a part of the harlem renaissance that may not have survivedor been resurrected thurman was fond of the first sentence of rafael sabatinis scaramouch he was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad he thought it applied to himself on the whole however his taste in novels ran to dostoevsky proust sherwood anderson and theodore dreiser especially the latter he made them his examples in another period perhaps he might have become a brilliant stylist like baldwin but in the twenties he tried to avoid polished prose he made a point of writing very fast and changing very little in the hope of achieving a kind of roughshod power something like that of dreiser he said there may have been another reason consciously or unconsciously he may have felt that for him time was limited he died of tuberculosis and there may have been prior indications but before he was finally stricken he published the blacker the berry as well as two lesser novels wrote much for the magazines saw his play harlem produced on broadway did bales of writing for mass media including movies and worked for a popular publisher as a sort of handyman in thurmans reflections on literature growing out of wide and attentive reading something like the baldwin sharpness was expressed reading an article by james baldwin in the new york times magazine or harpers today one who knew and read thurman will find himself stopped now and then realizing that here thurman would have warmly concurred in the greater seriousness of james baldwin however in the vast distance between the goals the two set for themselves as writers there is more to contrast than to compare where baldwin and the renaissance writer he most nearly resembles are concerned to what extent this difference of stance indeed difference of outlook reflects the diminishing of some forms of the resistance met by negro writers in the past is an open question but certainly no essayist of the twenties showed comparable power no prose writer of that era except toomer had his precision and style none was more exciting there are some indications that the personal histories of baldwin and thurman might have a good bit in common without resorting to speculation baldwin makes no secret of the blood and tears so to speak that have already gone into the forging of his talent the two novels that have resulted thus far include one that was widely praised and one that was widely read go tell it on the mountain garnered most of the praise giovannis room a good many more readers one gathers his notes of a native son however appears to have been more influential than either giving rise to a lively debate between those who esteem baldwin more for his essays than his fiction and those who would put it the other way round his nobody knows my name is a current sensation in any case a group of younger writers which starts with two such figures as ellison and baldwin need not fear that it will be ignored or fail to receive serious attention its constituents have only to establish that they belong on the roster louis e lomax whose essays have been appearing in harpers magazine and elsewhere recently whose book the reluctant african won the anisfield wolf award this year certainly qualifies interestingly his work has more than a little in common with that of walter white of the twenties as a writer except that lomax has published no fiction yet some critics have been mean enough to suggest that it might have been better if white hadnt either but put whites contributions to the century and other periodicalsof that decadebeside lomax of todays bracket rope and faggot with the reluctant african and you get a pair you might call them the georgia boys the young walter white made use of the excellent perspective of the lightskinned negro writer passing for white to get inside lynch mobs and make his report something beyond journalism seemed to result not favored by this special circumstance lomax has benefited from another that was not available to a writer of his type in the twenties television foremost among the writers of the present crop who have chosen journalism as their medium however is carl t rowan of the minneapolis tribune winner of three successive sigma delta chi newspaper awards together with its coveted medallion in author of south of freedom the pitiful and the proud go south to sorrow and coauthor with jackie robinson of wait till next year rowan has been a frequent contributor to look the saturday evening post and other magazines of the widest circulation more recently he has been rewarded with an appointment as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs journalistically at least rowan is one from the ranks of the newest negro writers who may be said to glitter when he walks no member of the renaissance group enjoyed the same kind or even comparable success it is possible however to see in the short stories of alston anderson as collected in the volume lover man a poignant reminder of the now almost forgotten short fiction of eric d waldron whose tropic death pleased the critics in the harlem period and made its authors career one to watch in those days there are those who are still waiting for more waldron who refuse to believe that the talent that created these authentic and throbbing tales more than thirty years ago could have ever stopped creating given normal health they keep expecting something he may have written and stashed away to come to light none of which is to say of course that the mentioning of anderson in the same breath with waldron suggests any likeness whatever in their personalities or in their writing careers apart from the single volumes of short stories by which each is principally known however there is another point both these writers have the west indies and panama in their backgrounds the harlem flavor captured by julian mayfield in his novels the hit the long night and the grand parade is very close to that which inspired rudolph fishers short stories and novels in the twenties like fisher too mayfield is a man of many talents he was an actor in a leading role in lost in the stars and he has had a play produced offbroadway while he has done more with the novel less with the shorter fiction than did fisher the similarities the reminders are definitely there and if the harlem renaissance group had no lorraine hansberry and no carl t rowan neither have the present group of negroes writers poets comparable to claude mckay countee cullen and langston hughes it remains to be seen whether paule marshall can replace the gifted zora neale hurston the harlem group also included helene johnson dorothy west frank horne sterling brown nella larson and the two fausets jessie r and arthur huff of course the present lot can point to good material among their reserves frank london brown le roi jones gloria oden john o killens herbert simmons melvin kelley are definitely coming on but it will take the best by all of these to fill the firmament as did the literary stars that brightened the harlem sky in the twenties means to me by hazel scott hree years in paris t rehabilitated me i went there originally for three weeks to rest and play an engagement before i left america unknown to anyone adam and i had a little talk i was not too happy with the work situation here and i was not happy personally adam said if youre not happy here why dont you stay over there a while and work the three weeks stretched out to three years they were for the most part gay funfilled workfilled years after a year skipper my son joined me we took a large apartment in paris which we still have and occasionally we went down to cannes to live with friends on the riviera during this period i entertained at clubs all over the continent and in north africa and the near east my three years out of america were three years of much needed rest not from work but from racial tension and by that i do not mean that i never run into racism that would not be true but whenever i encountered racism in any form it was so rare that it was an exception rather than the rule and it stuck out as an incident im not going to say that france is paradise but i will say this you can live anywhere if youve got the money to live you can go anywhere if youve got the money to go and whomever you marry or date is your business since my return to america i have been attacked by some uninformed people who say i ran away from the problem in one new york hotel where i was staying the room service waiter said i once thought you were the greatest but you have fallen in my estimation because you left america where the fight is well im here to tell you that roughly per cent of the armed service personnel overseas are southerners people who have never been exposed to racist thinking are being told what the southern white man thinks of the negro the fight is not confined to america it is worldwide a friend told me upon billie holidays return to the united states she called me the queen of the mau maus she meant this as a compliment she said it because of the affection and esteem the african students of paris hold for me i appeared in two french movies with some of the top french stars i also signed to play the lead in a french version of anna lucasta but a legal hassle over rights to the play prevented the producer from staging it between engagements i relaxed and absorbed the healthy restful atmosphere of paris my paris is not the city of champagne and caviar my paris is a pot full of red beans and rice and an apartment full of old friends and glasses tinkling and the rich happy sound of people laughing from the heart my paris is the warmth of the big thanksgiving dinners i had every year for my old and dear friends my paris is the enchantment of wandering through an old museum hand in hand with an old friend from hollywood lost in the wonder of rodin my paris is the magic of looking up the champs elysees from the place de la concorde and being warmed by the merry madness of the lights my paris is like the very first time you realize youre in love like the very first time youre kissed paris is all this and more but it is also pain while i was there some of my dearest friends died and some were murdered i lost lester young and billie holiday and i went to the very door of death myself after a serious operation lester who is not was such a beautiful individual came to see me every day during my recuperation and we listened for hours on end to frank sinatras album only the lonely it pains me to remember that he went from my apartment to an airplane which took him to america and death paris is billie holiday too i remember her one night toward the end singing a bitter blues trying to say everything trying to explain everything within the confines of twelve bars she had been robbed again and she was blue sitting there in the mars club in paris listening to this woman who represents not represented so many years of my life sitting there remembering how she used to protect me and curse me and run me home when i was and working on nd street in new york i was overcome by all the tragedy all the greatness and all the beauty of her life i had my own problems too anna lucasta had just collapsed and i was sort of inbetween and wandering while wondering where i was going and what i was doing i began to cry billie stopped gripped my arm and dragged me to a back room and slammed the door the next time you begin to feel like this she said just remember that youve got skipper and lady only has a little chihuahua and ladys making it and another thing never let them see you cry isnt that a wonderful fantastic thing to say never let them see you cry i learned a lot in paris about people and about myself one does not look into the face of death as i have and come away worrying about pettiness and cattiness and gossip and conforming it seems that everytime i am near death someone or something is asking me over and over how stupid can you get how many changes will you need before you find out whats important this last time when i spent a month or so in bed i got the message i am not likely ever to forget it love is important love some people go to their graves without ever learning that very simple lesson negro officials after the civil war by dr john hope franklin the act of march was specific about the qualifications of those who were to have a voice in the new program of reconstruction constitutions were to be written by delegates to be elected by the male citizens of the state twentyone years old and upward of whatever race color or previous condition who have been resident in said state for one year except such as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony at common law it was no easy task to administer satisfactorily these provisions of the act the commanding generals in the southern military districts were hard pressed to find competent and qualified registrars to enroll the electorate they used union army officers and freedmens bureau agents and a few of them used some negroes travel into remote areas was difficult and in some instances weeks elapsed before registrations were received compiled and made ready for elections some of the commanding generals felt a deep responsibility to provide a little political education for those voters who had never had the experience or the opportunity to participate in politics several of them gave explicit instructions to registration officials to provide the freedmen with adequate information regarding their political rights freedmens bureau officers and agents engaged by the generals to work in the registration program helped the new voters understand their rights and duties when bureau officials had no political literature of their own to distribute they disseminated materials prepared by the union league which was as we shall see easily the most active organization in the political education of the negro when the criteria for becoming electors were applied to the people of the south three groups qualified one group was the vast majority of negroes whose loyalty to the union was unquestioned and who merely had to prove that they were not felons and had lived in the state one year another was the northerners who had taken up residence in the south if they met the residence requirements they were enrolled finally there were the native southerners who qualified to take the ironclad oath and who were scrutinized with the greatest care the rank and file among these groups was to be the center of the controversy that raged over the ensuing decade out of these groups were to come the leaders who bore the majority responsibility for both the good and the evils flowing from the difficult task of rebuilding the south the entrance of negroes into the political arena was the most revolutionary aspect of the reconstruction program out of a population of approximately four million some qualified as voters but the most of them were without the qualifications to participate effectively in a democracy in this they were not unlike the large number of americans who were enfranchised during the age of jackson or the large number of immigrants who were being voted in herds by political bosses in new york boston and other american cities at this time they were the first to admit their deficiencies beverly nash an unlettered former slave sitting in the south carolina convention expressed the views of many when he said i believe my friends and fellowcitizens we are not prepared for this suffrage but we can learn give a man tools and let him commence to use them and in time he will learn a trade so it is with voting we may not understand it at the start but in time we shall learn to do our duty like nash most of the negroes were illiterate a slave existence could hardly be expected to prepare one for the responsibilities of citizenship especially when there were laws as there were in all slave states banning the teaching of slaves even if negroes were free as were more than in the slave states before the war laws forbade their being taught to read and write indeed when they came out of slavery many negroes did not know their own names many did not even have family names it goes without saying that a considerable number had not the vaguest notion of what registering and voting meant none of this is surprising it had been only two years since emancipation from a system that for more than two centuries had denied slaves most rights as human beings and it must be remembered that in these two years the former confederates in power all over the south did nothing to promote the social and political education of the former slaves what is surprising is that there were someand no paltry numberwho in were able to assume the responsibilities of citizens and leaders among south carolinas negro leaders was state treasurer francis l cardozo educated at glasgow and london who had been a minister in new haven and after the war was principal of a negro school in charleston robert b elliott born in massachusetts trained at eton college in england and elected to congress in was urbane and articulate j j wright a state supreme court justice had studied at the university of pennsylvania and had been a respected member of the pennsylvania bar before moving to south carolina after the war congressman james rapiers white father sent him to school in canada and when he returned to his native alabama after the war he had not only an ample formal education but a world of experience gained from travel and work in the north floridas secretary of state jonathan c gibbs graduated from dartmouth college and had been a presbyterian minister for several years when reconstruction began among the negro leaders of north carolina james w hood assistant superintendent of public instruction and james h harris an important figure in the constitutional convention were educated respectively in pennsylvania and ohio many others among them henry m turner of the georgia legislature hiram revels united states senator from mississippi and richard h gleaves member of congress from south carolina had much more than the rudiments of a formal education when they entered upon their official duties significant among negro leaders were those who were almost wholly selfeducated robert smalls of south carolina pursued his studies diligently until he had mastered the rudiments later he went to the united states house of representatives in mississippi john roy lynch regularly took time off from his duties in a photographers studio to gaze across the alley into a white schoolroom where he kept up with the class until he had mastered the courses taught there when he became speaker of the mississippi house and later a member of congress he relied on this earlier training before jefferson long went into congress from georgia he had educated himself and had become a merchant tailor in macon there were numerous other selfeducated negro leaders including john carraway and peyton finley of alabama james ohara and a h galloway of north carolina and james w bland and lewis lindsay of virginia from this educated element came the articulate responsible negroes who contributed substantially to the writing of the new constitutions and the establishment of the new governments in the former slave states most of the negro leaders were ministers a fair number taught school some were employees of the freedmens bureau or another federal agency here and there one found a negro who had been trained in the law there were of course farmers and there were some artisans engaged in a variety of occupations the economic interests and aspirations of the negro leaders varied widely it would be wrong to assume that they had no economic interests or that they had no views regarding the economic future of the south one of the really remarkable features of the negro leadership was the small amount of vindictiveness in their words and their actions there was no bully no swagger as they took their places in the state and federal governments traditionally occupied by the white planters of the south the spirit of conciliation pervaded most of the public utterances the negroes made in his first speech in the south carolina convention beverly nash asserted that the southern white man was the true friend of the black man pointing to the banner containing the words united we stand divided we fall nash said if you could see the scroll of the society that banner represents you would see the white man and the black man standing with their arms locked together as the type of friendship and union which we desire negroes generally wished to see political disabilities removed from the whites in south carolina several negroes presented a resolution asking congress to remove all such disabilities and it was passed in louisiana the negroes requested that former confederates be permitted to vote but for the time being not to hold office in alabama james t rapier a negro delegate to the constitutional convention successfully sponsored a resolution asking congress to remove the political disabilities of those who might aid in reconstruction in mississippi a democratic paper the jackson clarion admitted that in their general conduct negroes have shown consideration for the feelings of the whites in other words the colored people had manifested no disposition to rule or dominate the whites and the only color line which had existed grew out of the unwise policy which had previously been pursued by the democratic party in its efforts to prevent the enjoyment by the newlyemancipated race of the rights and privileges to which they were entitled under the constitution and laws of the country in south carolina beverly nash declared that in public affairs we must unite with our white fellowcitizens they tell us that they have been disfranchised yet we tell the north that we shall never let the halls of congress be silent until we remove that disability negroes attempted no revolution in the social relations of the races in the south francis b simkins in his new viewpoints of southern reconstruction has accurately observed that the defiance of the traditional caste division occasionally expressed in an official reception or in an act of the legislature was not reflected generally in common social relations negroes as a rule conceded to the insistence of whites that they were a race apart and they made little or no attempt to invade social privacies they did not even attempt to destroy white supremacy except where such supremacy rejected negroes altogether as human beings and there was almost nowhere any serious consideration given to providing legal approbation of interracial marriages while negroes sought equality as human beings they manifested no desire to involve themselves in the purely social relations of whites as individuals or as groups it is false it is a wholesale falsehood to say that we wish to force ourselves upon white people declared the nearwhite p b s pinchback of louisiana nor did any considerable number of negroes seek to effect an economic revolution in the south henry mcneal turner the fearless negro leader who was almost universally disliked by white georgians did what he could to assist the whites in recovering their economic strength in the georgia convention he secured the passage of two resolutions that indicated a remarkable willingness to stabilize the economic life of the white community one sought to prevent the sale of property whose owners were unable to pay their taxes the other provided for the relief of banks in south carolina negro leaders such as robert delarge and francis cardozo supported relief measures with the full knowledge that whites would benefit as much as negroes the movement of northerners into the south after the civil war is a part of the exciting drama of the migrations that had seen the continent populated from ocean to ocean and had taken americans new and old wherever opportunity beckoned the movement into the south was greatly stimulated by the favorable observations of scores of thousands of union soldiers who had seen action on southern battlefields some were mustered out of the army while still in the south and despite some southern feelings of hostility against them decided to adopt the south as their home others back in their northern homes waited only for the first opportunity to return to the south by the fall of for example more than five thousand union soldiers had settled in louisiana alone the movement was also stimulated by the large number of industrialists and investors who saw in the underdeveloped south an important new economic frontier those committed to the view that the souths recovery from the war would be accompanied by an era of unparalleled expansion began to move into the region bringing with them their own resources and often the resources of others with which to build railroads and factories and to purchase farm land and other properties many federal agentssome from the department of the treasury others from the freedmens bureausettled in the south and called it home northern teachers men and women braved numerous indignities at the hands of hostile whites in order to teach negroes and they cast their lot with the south there were those from the north moreover who saw new political opportunities in the south they hoped to use the newly enfranchised element and the problems arising out of reconstruction to achieve political power and economic gain for them the south was a happy hunting ground that they could not resist as to any frontier there went to the south the adventurers those who wanted to get rich quick and neerdowells who were fully prepared to embrace any cause including radical reconstruction that would benefit them these were the people who have been called carpetbaggers for the last ninety years this opprobrious term used as early as to describe any suspicious stranger was applied indiscriminately to all northerners in the south during reconstruction it has generally implied that as a group they had nothing in the way of worldly possessions and were thoroughly unprincipled in their determination to fleece and exploit the south until their carpetbags fairly bulged with the possessions of southerners and they were forced to acquire new coffers in which to place their illgotten gains they have been described as a group at work on a grand master plan to africanize the country one historian described them as gangs of itinerant adventurers vagrant interlopers who were too depraved dissolute dishonest and degraded to get the lowest of places in the states they had just left these descriptions fall far short of the mark they impugn the integrity and good intentions of thousands whose motives were otherwise even more important perhaps is the fact that such descriptions show no understanding of the variety and complexity of the motives underlying the migrations and no appreciation for the economic and political relationships that grew out of such motives there is no evidence that even the considerable number of negro migrants from the north were interested in africanizing the country indeed the term was an extravagance a flourishlike negro rule used to express disgust the other common descriptions are equally inaccurate as thomas conway pointed out a few months after the war many northerners including the teacher preacher merchant husbandman mechanic laborer and discharged union soldier were ready to move south he had persuaded northern men to take into the south to purchase land make loans and advances on crops their only fears were whether there was sufficient law and order to maintain security for their investments but they went south and they continued to go all during the reconstruction period in november sidney andrews observed that already several massachusetts men were in business in charleston and he estimated that at least half the stores on the principal streets of the city were run by northern men the careers of captain h s chamberlain and general john t wilder both of ohio illustrate the kind of activities in which numerous socalled carpetbaggers were engaged when chamberlain was mustered out of the union army in knoxville tennessee in he at once entered the iron and coal business in knoxville and is regarded by some as the real founder of the modern iron industry south of the ohio in chamberlain joined with general wilder later of wilders lightning brigade of ohio to organize the roane iron company which bought large tracts of coal and iron land and engaged extensively in the operation of coke works iron mines and furnaces together they became involved in many industrial and financial ventures including the dixie portland cement company the brookside cotton mills of knoxville and the first national bank of chattanooga that all socalled carpetbaggers were not simply radicals with no consideration for the welfare and development of the south can be seen also in the life of willard warner planter politician and iron manufacturer born in granville ohio and educated at marietta college warner served in the union army and went to the ohio senate in two years later he moved to alabama and with his ample resources engaged in cotton planting for several years he became active in republican politics and served in the united states senate from to then he organized the tecumseh iron company and served as president and manager until for this venture more than was supplied by his northern associates later he moved to tennessee where he had extensive investments and blast furnaces the overthrow of reconstruction seems not to have affected this carpetbagger for as late as the conservatives the democrats in his adopted state elected him to the tennessee legislature if recent historians have reviled northerners who settled in the south after the civil war their southern contemporaries were inclined to be grateful to them for their contributions to southern development clinton a cilley born in new hampshire and a harvard graduate settled in north carolina in after a career in law including several years as a judge of the lenoir superior court he was called in one of north carolinas ablest lawyers and finest citizens general wilder the iron manufacturer was very popular among southerners including former confederates during the spanishamerican war the governor of tennessee named the training camp near knoxville camp wilder in honor of the carpetbagger from ohio lieutenant b h true of the th new york volunteers who settled in georgia in was consistently popular with his new neighbors they not only supported his newspaper the appeal and advertiser but elected him as the celebrated farmer from morgan county to the state agricultural society the interest of such men and groups of men in the political future of the south was real with so much at stake in the way of investments and with full appreciation of the economic potential of the south they could not be indifferent to the uncertain political winds that were blowing across their adopted home their interest transformed itself into a strong desire to attain certain specific political goals for the south one was the achievement and maintenance of law and order they had seen enough hostility and lawlessness in many southern communities to cause considerable uneasiness about the safety of their investments they wanted governments that would insure this safety and if they could facilitate the establishment of such governments they would certainly do so another was the maintenance of a close alliance between government and the business community they had seen the importance of such an alliance in numerous developments in washington during the war and in the effective service that several state governments in the north had rendered the business community favorable banking and insurance laws tax exemptions or rebates land grants and other assistance to railroads were among the favors the government could and would under certain desirable circumstances grant to business and industry if at all possible northerners would see that this was done in the south finally most northerners in the south were convinced that their goals could best be attained through a vigorous wellorganized republican party throughout the south this was after all the party responsible for the intimate relationship between government and business on the national level and in several northern state governments they knew that there was little chance of luring the former confederates into the republican party and that the democratic party would oppose at every turn whatever republicans attempted to do southern democrats tended to equate republicans with abolitionists and thus to regard them as the destroyers of the souths cherished economic and social system northern republicans had to look to others in the south for political support a republican in the south did not have to belong to the thaddeus stevenscharles sumner wing of the party to reach the conclusion that negro suffrage was not only desirable but imperative for the conclusion was inescapable that the partys strength would come from negroes and from whatever support they could secure from loyal native southerners they did all they could to promote the enfranchisement of the negro and draw him into the republican party this did not mean however that the socalled carpetbaggers were interested in africanizing the south even when they undertook to northernize the south there was no revolution in the general social relations between negroes and whites b h true a new yorker living in georgia said that he was as friendly toward the negro as anyone but there is an antagonism which we all have against the race that i cannot get rid of i do not believe any man can had these radicals been radical on social questions they would have opposed the laws against intermarriage that were enacted during the radical regime they would also have stood for one system of public schools open to all races but their infrequent expressions in favor of such a system were feeble indeed these matters unlike negro suffragewere not among their primary interests and they gave them scant attention it was only natural that northerners in the south could wield political influence and exercise power far out of proportion to their numbers they were the best prepared to step into the vacuum created by the disfranchisement of the former confederates they had training and experience in political and economic matters that neither negroes nor loyal native southerners had they clearly knew what their interests were and how best they could be secured finally they had the support of the powerful victorious party that was in control of affairs in washington while their influence in the south was not always decisive or even critical it was invariably a factor in the determination of affairs present and future in the southern states no group of postwar southern leaders has been reviled or castigated or misunderstoodmore than loyal native southerners commonly known as scalawags the term came in all likelihood from scalloway a district in the shetland islands where small runty cattle and horses were bred it was used in western new york before the civil war in referring to a mean fellow a scape grace in the south the term was used by the opponents of reconstruction to describe those they regarded as the lowest meanest element in society these were the southerners who could swear that they had never voluntarily given aid countenance counsel or encouragement to persons in rebellion and had exercised or attempted to exercise the functions of no office under the confederacy they were largely men who had opposed secession the votes against secession in some state legislatures together with the known sentiment against such drastic action indicates that a considerable number of southerners dragged their feet or refused to have any part in the confederate cause many had for years smarted under a system that gave every advantage to the planter class to which very few of them belonged they bitterly resented the course of action pursued by the planter class which had led to a war that from their point of view became more and more a poor mans fight it is impossible to determine how many socalled scalawags were qualified to participate in reconstruction under the terms of the several acts of congress likewise it is impossible to determine the extent to which those who took the ironclad oath were eligible to do so after june those who took the oath were as president johnson had indicated to the commanding generals judges of their own honesty since the machinery as well as the personnel of registration was of questionable efficiency it is entirely possible that many who were clearly not eligible registered anyway there were some eligibles who refused to register and many who were not eligible advised the loyal southerners to have no part in the radical regime others advised the eligibles to register and then defeat the radical effort by voting against it if we are to wear manacles said governor perry of south carolina let them be put on by our tyrants not ourselves but there were those in the south who counseled loyal southerners to participate in the new reconstruction program and then to restrain any excessive or revolutionary tendencies that might militate against the best interests of the south the fact that negroes were to participate did not degrade white southerners or diminish their influence unless they purposely abandoned the field to negroes the new orleans picayune told its readers that promptness in registering and voting would convince the north that we mean to take care of our own affairs the savannah news gave similar advice when it declared that georgia expected every man to do his duty and register without delay to show his reverence for his noble commonwealth the charleston daily courier echoed the same view that you should register is an imperative duty which each man owes to himself to his community and to his state a curious assortment of native southerners thus became eligible to participate in radical reconstruction and the number increased as the president granted individual pardons or issued new proclamations of amnesty it became increasingly difficult to make a distinction between the views of the loyal southerners and the views of those whose citizenship was being restored on political and social questions they ranged from the radicalism of james w hunnicut of virginia who stood for the full legal and social equality of negroes and whites to the conservatism of milton candler a georgia senator who claimed that negroes were not citizens and therefore were not eligible to hold office certainly the majority of these loyal southerners could not be described as radicals in the sense of embracing the policies and program for negroes set forth by the radicals in congress often they advocated segregation of negroes and whites in educational and other institutions often they spoke as vigorously for the rights of the south as did any former confederate their primary interest was in supporting a party that would build the south on a broader base than the plantation aristocracy of antebellum days they found it expedient to do business with negroes and socalled carpetbaggers but often they returned to the democratic party as it gained sufficient strength to be a factor in southern politics these were the people who were called scalawags by their adversaries they hardly deserved the name nor did they deserve the numerous other opprobrious labels pinned on them by hostile critics wade hampton called them the mean lousy and filthy kind that are not fit for butchers or dogs another called them scaly scabby runts in a herd of cattle even the historians have joined in the verbal assault on these loyal native southerners one describes scalawags as vile blatant vindicative unprincipled perhaps during the period of their ascendancy the scalawags committed many offenses against the social order for the graft and corruption they must take at least a part of the blame but their most serious offense was to have been loyal to the union during the civil war or to have declared that they had been loyal and thereby to have enjoyed full citizenship during the period of radical reconstruction it is extremely difficult to determine the strength of the three groups that dominated the south during radical reconstruction there was constant fluctuation in the show of strength particularly among the native southerners and the northerners living in the south and there was constant defection with negroes dropping out of the picture under ku klux klan or other pressures with northerners leaving or going over to the conservatives as the opponents of radical reconstruction were called and with loyal southerners deviating from or deserting the radical cause altogether the best that one can do is look at the comparative numerical strength of the three groups and draw some inferences from the observation a likely time for such a comparison is when the several state conventions wrote the new constitutions required by the reconstruction acts the figures illustrate several significant points in the first place except for south carolina negroes enjoyed no numerical domination in the conventions the only other state in which they were nearly a majority was louisiana where by agreement they were to constitute per cent of the delegates thus negro rule as reconstruction has been erroneously described had an inauspicious beginning and indeed was never to materialize second the socalled carpetbaggers were in the minority in every state except mississippi many were so preoccupied with personal undertakings or with setting up schools and churches that they had no time for public service their position however was adequately represented by those new settlers who did find time to serve finally the native whites had a larger numerical representation in the conventions than is usually recognized dominating several conventions such as those in alabama georgia and north carolina and having substantial numbers in others they were prepared to play a significant part in the deliberations and in the administration of affairs in their states although leadership in the south came from these three groups at least in the early days of congressional reconstruction it does not follow that the leaders invariably worked together in promoting a radical program their motives values and goals were not the same and their effort to work together was often strained because of these differences far from entering into any conspiracy to degrade and destroy the southern way of life they frequently worked at cross purposes at times the position of the negro leaders approached that of the crusading abolitionists meanwhile the socalled carpetbaggers frequently preoccupied themselves with building up the alliance between the business community and the republicancontrolled state government all too often moreover the loyal southerners talked and acted like the conservative former confederates whom they presumably opposed cooperation was at best loose and irregular forced at times only by the threat of their common destruction it was under these circumstances that the three groups of leaders forged a program for the reconstruction of the southern states how such a program actually emerged is one of the fascinating chapters in american history the by duke ellington which way is jazz going questions of this kind are never easy to answer and in this case it might be easier to answer another question namely where is jazz coming from because one of the most important distinctions between the musical scenes of yesterday and today is that the average young musician nowadays comes equipped with conservatory experience with a background of educational equipment that is way out ahead of the training most of the musicians had not too many years ago as far as the future of jazz is concerned it is by no means certain that this will be the only factor in determining which way things will go whether jazz will be more folklike in nature or less whether it will be less or more mechanical is not important what is important is that it must live and the only way it can live is with the existence of an ever larger and more keenly interested audience to give it the support that must always be its life blood jazz like any other form of art has to be subsidized if there are more intelligent listeners of course it will move in a more intelligent direction this does not necessarily mean however that it will leave the realm of folk music and tend to move into a more mecanique type of thing recently i was asked whether i felt that jazz had moved a great distance away from its folk origins with the present state of rockandroll music i dont know how anyone can even consider asking such a question rockandroll is the most raucous form of jazz beyond a doubt it maintains a link with the folk origins and i believe that no other form of jazz has ever been accepted so enthusiastically by so many this is probably an easy medium of musical semantics for the people to assimilate im not trying to imply by this that rockandroll shows any single trend or indicates the only direction in which things are moving it is simply one aspect out of many i have written a number of rockandroll things myself but am saving them for possible use in a show as far as my own music in general is concerned i would categorize it as negro music it represents what i absorbed as a child and have grown up with among the people around me who were musicians and beyond that my own self and my surroundings have been injected into it there have been many rebellions concerning our music through the years as far back as when i said i was playing negro music some critics complained sophisticated lady is not negro music but the fact remains that sophisticated lady is negro musicits the negro i know and my interpretation no matter how many controversies may rage about the direction in which our music or jazz in general is going the music will continue to develop along natural lines some of it may become more complex and some of it will remain simple there will always be some kind of folk music around be it rockandroll or western or hillbilly music actually the word simple is sometimes misleading and is subject to many interpretations take for instance a recent composition entitled night creature we gave this number its premiere at carnegie hall performed by our orchestra combined with the symphony of the aira total of men despite this i feel that night creature basically was done in quite a simple manner it could have been developed into something far more complex and elaborate but essentially it tried to tell a rather simple story in fairly simple language the main purpose of it was to try to make the symphony swing which i believe we did very successfully what we did with night creature was in effect a new argument on a much larger scale than ever before against the theory that jazz cannot be written there are still a few diehards around who believe in this in fact not long ago i made up a little story to interpret their attitude there was a little raggedy boy out in the middle of a field he was wandering through the grass and stumbled over what appeared to be a black stick he picked it up and sat down under a weeping willow tree we of course know that it was a clarinet he was holding but he didnt know what it was but somehow or other intuition told him to just blow on itand when he blew out came jazz and thats the way jazz is supposed to be according to these diehardsits not supposed to be prepared or planned in any way another theory they hold is that there is such a thing as unadulterated improvisation without any preparation or anticipation it is my firm belief that there has never been anybody who has blown even two bars worth listening to who didnt have some idea about what he was going to play before he started if you just ramble through the scales or play around the chords thats nothing more than musical exercises improvisation really consists of picking out a device here and connecting it with a device there changing the rhythm here and pausing there there has to be some thought preceding each phrase that is played otherwise it is meaningless so as i say jazz today as always in the past is a matter of thoughtful creation not mere unaided instinct and although it is impossible for me or anyone else to paint any accurate picture of things to come i am sure that it will develop into something very big and beautiful it will be a combination of the contribution of all those people who are supposed to have natural ability and the work of all those who come out of the conservatories to add their embellishments as you may know i have always been against any attempt to categorize or pigeonhole music so i wont attempt to say whether the music of the future will be jazz or not jazz whether it will merge or not merge with classical music there are simply two kinds of music good music and the other kind classical writers may venture into classical territory but the only yardstick by which the result should be judged is simply that of how it sounds if it sounds good its successful if it doesnt it has failed as long as the writing and playing is honest whether its done according to hoyle or not if a musician has an idea let him put it down on paper and lets not worry about whether the result is jazz or this or that type of performance lets just say that what were all trying to create in one way or another is american music of fondue and faubus by hoyt w fuller t hope you do not mind j said my host herr john tesch i would like to ask you a question i told him of course that i did not mind frau tesch smiled politely and refilled my coffee cup tell me did you go to school with white boys and girls in america he asked to myself i thought well here we go the old problem again to herr tesch i replied yes i did was there the same kind of violence at your school as there was at little rock and did the whites try to keep you out of school i told him there was no violence at all then i explained that in detroit where i went to school white and negro children attend the same schools with no more than the usual conflicts common to children everywhere this was stretching a point and overlooking some school boundary gerrymandering here and there but it was true enough then would you please tell us what the problem is at little rock i reflected a moment before plunging into this now routine and expected discussion i explained that little rock was in the south the nations traditionally segregated section i cited the fouryearold supreme court ruling against separate schools i skimmed the surface of the political significance of governor faubuss action in calling out the national guard to frustrate the implementation of the courts ruling and explained that this left the president virtually no alternative but to support the court with federal troops my position was not a comfortable one it never is at these times europeans who actually are unfamiliar with continental united states are prone to see racial incidents there in terms of stark blacks and whites for many of them there is no significant distinction between little rock and detroit it is after all america if violence is perpetrated against a negro in montgomery the picture they get in their minds is simple whites attack negroes the regional and historical circumstances we customarily cite to excuse or extenuate the outbreak cannot serve the same purpose for them i glanced at the faces of herr and frau tesch their eyes were full of sympathy for me and for all the negroes in america and they were unquestionably sincere but i wondered if they would have the same sympathy and compassion if they lived in say maryland or indiana instead of in switzerland i would not prejudge them and yet this thought had occurred to me many times during talks with europeans who expressed outrage at racism in america as a reporter in detroit and chicago i learned that many of the whites most aggressive in barring negroes from housing schools and parks were first and second generation americans we had only just finished dining and removed to the living room for coffee cake and brandy the coffee was excellent perhaps the best i had tasted in all europe and the cake especially purchased for the occasion was delicious for dinner frau tesch had prepared what she called a typical swiss dish one we reserve to share with good friends it was a magnificent cheese fondue served with kirsch and tea and it was indeed a significant gesture at friendship the fondue casserole piping hot and kept that way over alcohol flames was placed in the center of the elegantly appointed table a huge platter piled with neatly cut sections of bread was put alongside to eat the fondue each diner had to take a square of bread with his fork and dip it into the chafing dish it was as intimate a meal as if the three of us were eating from the same plate the kirsch and brandy had mellowed my host and now relaxed in his easy chair in the compact but cozy room he was ready for an evening of quiet talk herr tesch holds a very responsible job in the finance department of the canton of bern a governmental division roughly comparable to an american county he is a seriousmiened and seriousminded man not yet forty very proud of his swiss ancestry and of the national swiss character which is conservative almost to an extreme he was emphatic in asserting his own conservative views but he was genuinely baffled and disturbed by the american mentality as demonstrated in incidents like that at little rock we find it difficult to understand he told me i dont think such things could happen in switzerland the racists behave as though negroes are not americans too swiss people might individually have dislike for negroes or might not wish to associate with them but i think it is inconceivable for the swiss to want to deny rights to other swiss or other people simply because they dislike them there is something so inhuman in that and especially when children are made to suffer i agreed herr tesch went on it seems to me these things are very bad for america your country is engaged in trying to influence other nations to your side countries in the middle east asia and africa surely america must know these nations will not respect americas message of freedom when negroes in america do not even have freedom here my swiss friend was not voicing a mere opinion following the korean war he had served on a united nations commission in that divided land he met and talked with thinking young men from several countries of asia and africa and they were all acutely aware of the great disparity between americas preachment and practice of democracy i told him there were many important americans who understood this very well but that there was little they could do beyond stating their case and appealing to reason there is something else something which bears only indirectly on these matters of race but i think it is important herr tesch said even in countries where the matter of race is no problem there is suspicion and distrust of america because of what happens to negroes there for example it is believed there is oil in the mountains here the swiss people do not have the capital to drill for oil and there are american firms which are interested but the swiss are reluctant to invite the americans in this might give them an opportunity to dominate our economy and our customs can americans be fair to others when they are not even fair to their own i think not america is the worlds biggest democracy and switzerland is the smallest but we like our brand of democracy better frau tesch a slim attractive young woman whose english was heavily accented had remained quite still during much of the discussion finally speaking very slowly she posed a question now that the situation at little rock seems settled at least for the present do you think there will be other such cases when the schools open again she asked yes i told her yes i think there will be many other such cases you must understand that there also are very powerful and influential forces in america which are dedicated to keeping negroes in a position of inferiority they are well organized and well financed and they will create disorders when and where they choose to she considered my answer for a moment then she shook her head sadly it is such a terrible thing she said yes i said i am afraid it is a terrible thing there was nothing more to say bern switzerland march a dangerous day in mississippi by c eric lincoln t all began with a promise that i had made the preceding christmas when a fishing rod turned up under the tree for my son cecil eric aged seven a fishing rod at christmas is of course a reasonable implication that there will be some fishing done the following summer the promised day finally arrived and at the crack of dawn lincoln four chubby little hands aided and abetted by a cheering section from the direction of the kitchen did without any ceremony whatever drag me from my slumbers with great insistence that i hurry and make worms come out of the ground with two sticksjust like when i was a boy i couldnt find the right kind of sticks any real fisherman knows that worms wont come up when you rub just any old two sticks together half an hour of spade work netted three worms and two blisters while the others were at breakfast i hurried around the corner to the fishermans one stop s and dug a whole boxful right off the counter for sixty cents back home i dumped them into a tomato can with the three we already had and went in to eat by ten oclock we were finally on our way i made a mental check to see if we had everything wife kids picnic basket fishing rods worms and of course gomer gomer was a fuzzy little puppy of dubious breed and uncertain parentage but gomer was a law unto herself where we went she went i had come to understand it and by majority vote i had to accept it we lived in memphis in the southwest corner of tennessee directly across the mississippi river to the west is arkansas and any of the highways leading south will land you in mississippi within half an hour or so a system of levees maintained by the u s army engineers protects the low country east of the river from floods and within a few miles of memphis there are a number of bayous between the river and the levees the bayous are widely known for good fishing now the levee which has been made famous by song and storyrises just outside the city limits and follows the river southward into the magnolia state our plan was to drive south on the highway for a few miles and to then turn off on the levee at some likely spot to look for one of the more accessible fishing holes among the bayous none of us noticed or remembered when we crossed the state line into mississippi there were two reasons why this was important one was that i did not have a mississippi fishing license the other was that i am a negro and there was a great deal of racial tension in that state at the time less than two weeks before on my way to memphis from atlanta i had driven more than a hundred miles out of the way to avoid traveling in that state instead of traveling u s through birmingham and tupelo i had gone around through chattanooga and nashville in order to bypass both alabama and mississippi the emmett till case had stirred up a lot of excitement and preliminary hearings on the murder were then going on in jackson as we clipped along the highway south of memphis and turned off on the broad levee all this was forgotten however i could only think of how good it was to be out of the city and the prospect of a day of fishing was more than refreshing now that the trip was underway it promised to be fun we kidded and sang as we anticipated the days catch little did we know that what we would catch that day would not be fish to the left of the steep levee were broad bottomlands of corn and pasture rich and verdant in the summer sun the fat whitefaced beef cattle grazing in some of the pastures reminded me that the economic base of the south was changing we saw no cotton only pastureland stretching for mile upon mile along the base of the levee occasionally we could hear the sharp staccato of a tractor and we could see the alfalfa and other silage being cut or raked and baled down the levee on the right rolled the dirtybrown brooding mississippi the father of waters between the river and the levee were occasional sloughs and bayous surrounded for the most part with a dense undergrowth and dotted with the grotesque trunks of cypress trees some of this land was fenced now and then we could see one or two scraggy brown cows switching flies in the edge of the undergrowth in sharp contrast to the fat cattle on the other side of the levee all in all it looked strangely familiarlike contrasting neighborhoods on opposite sides of a trolley line some ten or twelve miles down the levee road we noticed two small bayous in a clearing about fifty yards from the river bank a raingullied gravel road angled down from the levee and into the clearing a barbed wire fence ran along the base of the levee and a weather beaten stockgate brought the road to an abrupt halt we decided that this was as good a place as any to stop and try our luck besides a quick poll showed that we ourselves were per cent hungry so i urged the car carefully down the side of the levee toward the bayou young cecil undid the fastenings on the old gate and opened it with a flourish i drove into the enclosure following the crooked road atop the weedgrown embankment between the two small bayous my intention was to drive to the far side of the bayous to find a spot overlooking the river where we could spread our lunch there was no longer any gravel on the road now and the weeds and swamp grass all but obscured the road itself after we had driven almost half way across the embankment i could see that the road just ahead of the car was completely under water worse than that it now appeared that the embankment narrowed steadily as it neared the far side of the bayous we could no longer go forward and there was no way to turn the car around if we got out at all i would have to back the car some forty or fifty yards along a narrow slippery embankment partially under water and overgrown with weeds i got out of the car and went to examine the road behind us to my very great dismay i found that the ground was so soft and spongy that the tires of the car were already sunk in the mud almost up to the rims how does it look my wife asked i caught the strained note of artificial cheer in her voice damp and dirty i answered with equal bravado looks as if well have to back out i stood a moment debating with myself whether it would not be better to let the kids and their mother get out and wade back to safety through the mud and weeds a second look at the tall rank grass suggested that greater safety probably lay with the car the swamplands along the mississippi are well known for harbouring the deadly cottonmouthed water moccasin it was not an easy decision i climbed back into the car and eased it into reverse we inched back along the edge of the bayou and just as i began to feel like congratulating myself on my driving skill my son who was sitting on the rear seat opposite the driver leaped over and tapped me on the shoulder daddy he said with that wellknown tone most fathers recognize as the setting for a pleaseincreasemyallowance request yes what is it i wished very much that he would not divert my attention just then the car seemed to be sliding a little could you please stop the car and let us get out i turned off the ignition the car wasnt moving anyway why do you want to get out i demanded somewhat testily there are snakes out there well if you dont let us get out came the matteroffact rejoinder we are all going to be swimming in the bayou and there are alligators out there the car is getting ready to turn over i think the children had been taught never to panic in the face of danger and if the boy felt that we were actually about to turn over into the bayou i was very proud to note that there was no fear in his voice only intelligent concern looked back at little joyce she was wide eyed and silent she was not panicky but she was certainly not very happy either for that matter neither was i i got out and sloshed as nonchalantly as i could around to the back of the car no wonder it had seemed to be sliding the right rear wheel had slipped over the soft edge of the bayou and the car had settled on its axle at a crazy angle it was literally hanging over the water and slowly sinking deeper into the soft bank i hurried back around to the other side guess wed better all get out i said in what i hoped was a casual tone of voice the man is right she may go over sure enough and i wouldnt like to have to play hero in this bayou without my swimming trunks ok easy now lets all slide gently over this way and come out on this side easy now easy does it i prayed silently as the evacuation got under way first joyce then mother and finally after an agonizing eternity of seconds cecil popped out on the bank with the picnic basket under one arm and the eternal gomer under the other im hungry he announced without ceremony lets eat first so that we can be strong enough to push it out we made our way carefully back through the grass and weeds and out through the creaking old gate while the girls spread the lunch under a convenient oak i set out to look for help the stalwart sir cecil climbed upon the gate to stand guard hey dad he yelled as i started up the levee youd better come back as soon as you can and get our car out of here or were going to get put in jail right here on this gate it says private keep out in our enthusiasm to reach the water no one had noticed the weatherworn sign nailed to one of the cross bars on the gate with redoubled apprehension i trudged on up the side of the levee i had scarcely reached the top of the embankment when a car approached traveling in the direction of the highway in response to my waving and shouting the automobile pulled over to the edge of the read and halted it was occupied by a white man a boy of about ten and a suspicious looking collie i pointed down through the trees to where my car hung over the edge of the bayou and explained my predicament as rapidly as i could boy you shore are in a pickle the man said id shore hate to be in trouble on one of these plantations down here if i was you he shook his head ruefully and spat across the levee for emphasis it was only then that i came to a full realization of the potential gravity of our situation the term plantation forced my attention to the fact that was in mississippi plantation is a word which is almost never used in reference to a farming operation in tennessee i was in a pickle and i knew it how to get out of it as quickly and expediently as possible was becoming increasingly complex it was to become a great deal more complex before that day was over the white man offered to give me a lift a mile or two down the levee to a point from which i could walk to the plantation store he mentioned to me the boy got on the back seat with the dog and i sat with the driver it turned out that they were from memphis and that they had been hunting cypress knees down along the bayous they had a home workshop where they converted the knees into lamps and other objects for their friends the man said within a few minutes we came to a place where a dirt road angled down the far side of the levee away from the river and lost itself in a forest of tall green corn the man stopped the car and pointed to the road now if youll just follow that lit old road there for about a mile i believe itll bring you out mighty near that store theyve got over there if you cant get anybody over there to help you i expect youll have to go all the way into town to get a wrecker to drag you out cost you some money too i expect this is if anybodyll come boy you sure are in a pickle he added as an unhappy afterthought i thanked him for the ride and made my way down the side of the levee the road ran straight across the longest cornfield id ever seen after nearly half an hour of brisk walking i suddenly found myself in the back yard of a little unpainted cabin an elderly negro woman was drawing water from a well near the edge of the cornfield she told me that the main road was just a little way ahead and that id find the store jest a little ways down to the left it was past noon when i reached the plantation store and there were fifteen or twenty negro fieldhands sitting around under the trees eating their lunches from paper bags two men who seemed to have finished were sitting in a ford pickup parked under a black walnut tree i explained my problem to them and asked if they knew where i could hire someone with a tractor to come and pull me out one of the men immediately climbed out of the truck and left muttering something about it being time to go back to the field the other man who said his name was henry explained that it was the height of the haying season and that all available men were expected to be in the fields helping to get the hay in before the rains should come in another twenty minutes or so the dinnerbreak would be over besides all of the tractors were in the fields in use in the haying operations but henry opined i dont spect you need no tractor nohow this here lil old truckll outpull any tractor boss wheelers got on the place near about anyway he patted the green ford truck with real affection at that moment i was willing to love it too a few more minutes of talk revealed that boss wheeler was the plantation manager or straw boss that they were already behind schedule with the haying and that anyway he wheeler wouldnt be likely to accommodate me with a tractor if the last straw was in the barn and he had a hundred tractors rusting in the shed the only negroes boss wheeler liked were the ones who worked for him henry said i took it that it would be a waste of time to try to see mr wheeler on the other hand henry thought that if mr mac was on the place i might have better luck mr mac he explained was the owner of the plantation and his real name was mcculloch however it seemed that mr mcculloch had gone into memphis to a stock sale the only real alternative lay with henry and his ford i didnt really think the truck could do the job but then there was no choice we could try i explained to henry that he would probably be late getting back to work in the hay fields but that i would pay him for any loss he suffered he said hed have me out and fishing before anybody would miss him henry must have been born an optimist we got into the truck and roared off down the road and off through the cornfield when we had crossed the levee and come down on the other side near the river cecil swung the gate open and henry backed the truck out on the embankment and hitched it to the sadly listing automobile it looked as if the list had increased by about five degrees henry put his truck into second gear and the heavy logchain holding the two vehicles together grew taut as the pickup strained valiantly against the inertia of the heavy chrysler finally the trucks tires began to spin and smoke you could have smelled rubber all over the plantationand in less than five minutes the truck was hopelessly mired in the mud as for the car it had not moved an inchexcept perhaps deeper into the muck of the weedgrown bayou we unhitched the chain and tried to work the truck out but after half an hour we had only succeeded in getting it mired deeper into the oozing mud the transmission was soon resting flat upon the ground the negro field hand became quite excited he swore at the truck and struck the wheels with a length of chain finally he began to talk to the green ford as if it were a living thing alternately abusing it and then pleading with it to come on out of this ol mudhole at intervals he would leap into the cab and race the engine in a futile effort to shake loose from the awful grip of the mississippi mud eventually a second pickup appeared against the skyline high up on the levee at this point henry became almost incoherent and perspiration stood out upon his black face like glass beads the truck on the levee had turned off down the steep little road approaching the gate through which it had been our fate to come i sensed that it must be carrying the dreaded boss wheeler and that this was responsible for henrys state of agitation i tried to console him by thanking him for trying to help and promising to take the full blame for his predicament looking in my wallet i found seven dollars i gave it all to henry hoping that it could somehow help to make up for the trouble i had inadvertently caused him the pickup truck had stopped just inside the gate and a white man followed by a negro was walking rapidly in our direction suddenly my own apprehension increased my car was stuck in the mud and out of service besides that my wife and children were with me and i had just given away my last dollar if anything should happen to me they couldnt even get home i did have a checkbook but who out here in the wilderness could cash a check except the man on whose property i was a trespasser i studied the planter as he advanced on us he wore khaki trousers and a khaki shirt halflength leather boots and a pith helmet he was bronzed not very tall and looked to be about sixty years old he walked briskly and with a sort of bounce that seemed to carry him over the weeds instead of through them close behind him come willie bob the negro fieldhand who had refused to help henry when i approached them at the plantation store as they drew near henry climbed into the truck and began to spin the wheels more furiously than ever before the planter stopped and sniffed at the burning rubber well ill be damned he said stuck in the mud like toadfrogs both of them willie bob go over there and tell henry to turn that motor off before he sets the river afire turning to me he said thats a heavy car chrysler that little doodle bug of a truck cant pull it out between now and freezing cant pull itself out looks like to me he walked around to the rear of the pickup and tried to peer underneath it i was trying to get across here to do some fishing i tried to explain as soon as i could get a word in thought so thought so the white man interrupted used to be a little old road across here river backs up and washes it out every year you couldnt hardly drive a billygoat across here now let alone a car we both laughed at this and my anxiety began to subside a little mr mcculloch opened the door of the truck and motioned for henry to get out youd better locate yourself over on the other side of the levee before mr wheeler misses you he said or i expect youll catch it henry shuffled his feet and looked uneasily at the truck all mired in the mud he very plainly did not wish to leave that ford truck struck there in that mud never mind the truck mr mcculloch said tell wheeler ive got it willie bob take henry on back to the field and bring one of those tractors over here hell this truck isnt going to walk out of here all by itself the two fieldhands left in the planters truck instead of the awkward silence which might well have attended such an embarrassing situation as the one in which i found myself the next half hour or as fate decreed it the next three hours proved to be an unusual experience in human relations it turned out that some thirty years earlier the mississippi planter had studied pharmacy in atlanta the college of pharmacy from which he had graduated had long since ceased to exist and it had been twenty years since he had revisited that famous georgia city yet his interest in the people and schools the newspapers and other institutions of present day atlanta was as alive as it would have been had he lived there only yesterday we walked back toward the gate and sat down on a log beneath the oak where my wife had spread our picnic lunch by this time the conversation had shifted to farming and cattle raising and finally to how a man trained in pharmacy in atlanta came to be a farmer in mississippi it seems that the mcculloch family had migrated from scotland to this country in the early s settling first in georgia and eventually moving westward to mississippi where they acquired extensive land holdings after the civil war the family scattered some went west to california and alaska many went east to enter the professions of seven brothers only the planters father had remained with the landor what was left of it from his father he had inherited a few hundred acres on the condition that he would live on the land and hold it the lean years of the depression had shrunk the land still more it had been necessary to sell some in order to keep any at all but mcculloch had kept faith with his father he had stayed with the land and he had never practiced pharmacy again the conversation shifted this time to philosophy and the modern existentialist movement in europe and the question of its influence on modern art mr mcculloch had been reading sartre and we were lost in discussion when the roar of a powerful motor upon the levee announced the return of willie bob as a matter of fact willie bob had already driven down from the levee in the truck and parked it the motor we heard was that of a tractor driven by another hand and balanced precariously on the tractor couplinggrinning sheepishlywas henry mr mcculloch shook his head as long as henry has this truck to drive he said there is practically no chance of any woman ever claiming him for a husband the tractor was hitched to the mired truck with the log chain and in a minute or two the truck was dragged free henry climbed in and drove joyously away however fortune did not so favor us with the car a few minutes of pulling at the heavy chrysler only succeeded in miring the tractor in the mud up to its axles no amount of digging and packing the deep ruts with sticks and rocks seemed to help my embarrassment returned with increase when i heard the planter tell willie bob well have to stop those boys over in the south pasture and borrow their tractor willie bob drove away in the second truck eventually the second tractor arrived with two additional men with them they brought a number of shovels and another heavy log chain when we got the first tractor out we could hitch them both to the car and pull it out easily the possibility was cheering such was not to be the second tractor was hitched to the first and a driver straddled the seat on each they roared and spun their wheels but the muck was simply too soft for traction the second tractor was soon more hopelessly mired than the first the shovels were brought into into play the men dug around the wheels and tamped more rocks and sticks into the mire under them anxious to help i took a shovel and began to dig better let me have that shovel the white man said i never saw a college professor who could dig his weight in half a dayexcept at a dinner table he laughed and took the shovel without apparent effort he began to sling the muck over his shoulder with a rhythm matching that of the negroes again the tractors roared and spun their wheels and again they sank deeper into the mud mr mcculloch surveyed the situation for a moment by now my embarrassment was approaching fear willie bob he said finally we dont seem to be getting anywhere in a hurry go over on the hill there where theyre baling and get that big m tractor hurry now its getting late turning back to me he said now professor you dont have to worry ive got thirteen tractors on this plantation and if it takes them all well get you out now i expect your wife is upset too you go over there and tell her that we can handle it within minutes three more men came driving up on the biggest tractor id ever seen directly behind them came willie bob in his truck as the third tractor was being backed into position i could see henrys truck coming down off the levee there was a white man in the cab beside him the white man got out of the truck and came toward us on the run his face was very red and it was easy to see that he was angry the negroes fell back and let him pass he ignored me completely and strode over to where mr mcculloch was having the third tractor hitched to the second which was mired in the mud the planter seemed surprised to see him well he said casually i didnt want to bother you but were having a little trouble here mr wheeler the manager turned completely around and looked directly at me it looks like it he said in a highpitched nasal drawl a little trouble three tractors so far two trucks and a dozen hands that shore is a little trouble he spat in the mud without further ado wheeler began to shout orders at his men he had them take a small log and bind it lengthwise across the rear wheels of the second tractor then he himself mounted the machine and directed henry to pull with the big tractor hitched in front the motors roared alive now however instead of the wheels of the mired tractor spinning in the mud as before as soon as the log bound across them struck the ground the wheels were raised completely out of the muck and up to the surface of the road it was then a simple matter to fill up the tire ruts with rocks and drive the tractor out under its own power the same technique was applied to the tractor which first became mired and in less than ten minutes both were on their way back to the fields wheeler then tied both lengths of chain together and fastened the free ends to the big tractor and to my car the greater length of chain enabled the tractor to operate on comparatively solid ground and get better traction i got in the car to steer it in spite of the fact that there was a good possibility that it would topple over into the bayou as soon as it began to move the big tractor crept forward the chain grew taut and the car was dragged along the edge of the bayou until it finally moved wholly upon the bank as soon as i had the car in the road again the plantation boss re moved the chains threw them into the truck and drove away after directing his men to return to work immediately i felt frustrated because i had no opportunity to thank the man for his help in what had seemed an increasingly hopeless situation turning to mr mcculloch i tried again to apologize for trespassing and for the three tractors two trucks and a dozen hands who were tied up in trying to get me out of the bayou when they should have been harvesting hay somehow i felt that to offer a check in an attempt to pay for his kindness would have been insulting his next words proved me right son he said tractors and trucks are not the important issues in the world neither is hay some men would disagree with me and there are some who havent given much thought to it but human beings like you and me and your children over thereand what we can do for each otherthis is what matters now why dont you go on in there and catch some fish and i wish i had time to show

a voice crying in the south african wilderness by peter ritner four african lawyers who happened to be christian founded the african national congress in 1912 at that time of course the south african government was still paternally guided by the imperial parliament in london therefore an appeal to the consciences of the coalition of englishspeakers and moderate afrikaners who ran the country on the spot but which was utlimately responsible to an enlightened upper class in england seemed to promise the best chance of success the principle of operation was publicity vividly present the africans plight to these europeans the theory ranmake them feel in their bones the misery of the african and their best instincts will take over and right the perennial wrongs such a campaign of publicity has continued to be the main principle of congress operations but the audience which was meant to profit by it has sadly deteriorated the imperial parliament has vanished with the kingdom of 4 hanover the englishspeakers in south africa have quite lost their victorian religion without having lost the taste for creature comforts and the publicity which the congress has in mind is thrown away on the afrikaner he already knows everything about the plight of the african for he created it today the presidentgeneral of the african national congress is an extremely captivating and nobleminded man chief albert luthuli the only african who is a true national figure in the country the chief is an individual of subtle nuance of personality he is one of those rare beings who commands a spiritual alchemy which changes peace and brotherhood into concepts that seem to be as exciting as war and servitude now in his seventies stricken with heart disease the chief is writing the epilogue of a lifetime spent in trying to rouse the european to see the reasonableness of our case long ago when the northern africa for the africans leaders were still in their cradles before they had become presidents and prime ministers the chief was already a leader of his people he has failed to lead them to a land of milk and honey but this is a failure he has never conceded and at the same time he has never modified the modesty and the finality of his political aims full participation of the african in the government and control of their future he is undoubtedly the only african politician on the continent who would deny himself the pleasure of devouring the afrikaner alive for he is a christian and a noble who lives up to all his faiths at once but naturally he neither expects nor receives any gratitude from the afrikaners they have deposed him however his people and the new chief connive at flouting this deposition arrested him persecuted him insulted him and beaten him in his lifetime the chiefs position as spokesman for the congress and for the urban africans of south africa will never be challenged but the chief himself is the first to admit that the working leadership of the movement the secretariat in johannesburg has been forced by the outrageous bellicosity of afrikanerdom to veer far to the left of the traditional congress standthe stand to which the chief is personally committed men can be chewed up just so much and the chief has little enough to show for thirty negro digest december 1961 years of waiting around for european reasonableness to assert itself if the congress means to capture the loyalties of younger africans which of course it must do if it intends to remain effective it must meet on new ground the new poles of african events the diehardism in south africa and the new freedom in northern africa but inevitable innovations in programing have not reduced the chief to a figurehead he is too wise to begrudge the younger generation its right to chart a new path and in his heart he suspects i would guess that as a younger man facing the apartheid of the midcentury he too would bend his convictions so he has not simply retired from the fray but has used his prestige to construct for himself something like the constitutional position of the british queen he reminds and warns the officials and young warhawks of his party of the realities of life when their zeal seems to be overpowering their good sense specifically he tells his subordinates that the congress is not yet powerful enough for a big move organization on the reserves and the farms hardly exists at all and even in the cities party discipline is rudimentary when a chord in the africans soul is plucked in just the right way he is capable of a stubbornness and solidarity that are sensational such a phenomenon could be seen operating at the time of the johannesburg bus boycott of 1957 but this boycott was not a nationwide thing and it was more a spontaneous outburst than a congress offensive whether it is to be party or conspiracy the congress has far to go before it has honed itself into a true political instrument when the chief tires of reminding his collaborators that they must make themselves into a political party before they can hope to achieve the aims of a political club he turns to his second theme and that is that when and if blood begins to flow in south africa most of it will spill from black bodies not white ones the european is outnumbered four to one in south africa this is a sizable gap but not sizable enough so that the africans can deal with their enemies by drowning them in spit as gandhi once threatened to drown the english in india behind the afrikaners seemingly suicidal policy of leaving the african no alternative but violence there is a countervailing afrikaner readiness even eagerness to commit violence on the african to wind up the whole tortuous business to a climax the afrikaner youth is armed and drilled from the time he enters adolescence and trained in local militias the afrikaner government possesses jet planes and tanks and phosphorus bombs and the other impedimenta of modern 6 war and the afrikaner is sick of the african sick of his own vitalseating sickness he is sick of the shroud of melancholy and guilt which the thousands of africans of his day to day experience are wrapping around his soul he is sick of accusing rags and protruding ribs sick of the unconquerable presumption of men who ought not to think of themselves as men but in falling a victim to this fearful and reckless belligerence the afrikaner is summoning up out of the depths of african personality a complementary yearning for the consummation of violence doordieism increasingly will be the byword of young africans a historical horror is being compounded right before the old chiefs eyes and i suspect that the disastrous courses of the past decade have finally throttled all his hopes and optimism that it can be avoided but chief luthuli will go to his death preaching against a racial war of extermination and to the end he will conceive it to be his minimum duty to his people to warn them of the high blood price of freedom government regards him as the strongest and most dangerous thorn in its side like prime minister verwoerd luthuli was a college teacher before he turned to politics teaching at a small missionrun college for the bantu in 1936 he left the quiet academic life for the more turbulent world of politics when his tribe elected him to be chief of its small reserve of 5000 people chief luthulis duties combined those of administrator lawgiver and father confessor he would as he recalls sit under a shady tree and decide everything from questions regarding the dowry of a bride to marketing the tribes sugar cane crop most efficiently in the 1940s luthuli became active in the swelling bantu campaign to lower south africas color bars later as an official of the african national congress the chief bantu political organization he toured south africa urging nonviolent resistance to apartheid the nationalist government tried to curb luthulis growing influence first it dismissed him from his position as chief the bantu retaliated by electing him president of the african national congress the government struck back by banning luthuli from all large cities for a year later it confined him to his native village for two years shortly after this ban was up luthuli was arrested for treason for taking part in campaigns against existing laws before his case came to trial however the charges were dropped since last may the government has kept him confined to his home province of natal luthulis aides say he still believes that the best way to get results is through nonviolent resistance and through roundtable negotiations what colonialism did to africa by sekou toure he african problem is both simple and complex and many nations groups and parties are facing the kind of new problems with which guinea is now faced africa is a geographical and a human entity but both morally and spiritually it is more diverse than any other it is therefore essential to discuss the problems that have to be solved in that context it is impossible for me either in writing or in lectures to present these problems objectively but it is possible to present a context though it will necessarily contribute an incomplete image of my country a country that some of you probably knew before i was born the essential factor that i want to bring out is the extent to which we in africa are conditioned by our way of life our country is backward and has gone through three distinct stages first there was the stage of precolonization in which our organization was communal each group had its own customs its own concepts of economic organization its own philosophy it had its own sketchy form of civilization but the important thing is that this civilization was our own like other parts of the world our countries knew insecurity and famine and went through the kind of struggle which is common to the whole human race to satisfy their material and moral needs people had to use what means they found at hand they had few contacts with the outside world in the second stage with the arrival of outsiders these contacts were established at first they were economic then social cultural and political during this period our original way of life was interrupted and modified by our contact with other civilizations sometimes the evolution characteristic of the first stage was arrested sometimes it became more dynamic in any case life was changed above all it was diverted from its normal course in my grandparents time ethnic language and tribal divisions gave way to divisions on a territorial basis african lands became colonies whose frontiers no longer respected the natural divisions which though not watertight had formerlywhether for instance in senegal in sudan or in guineahad a real existence these countries are inhabited by the same races and have the same civilization their essential characteristics are those of the entire african continent but the colonizers had their own methods the first change that they made the modification of frontiers was a negative contribution the second the linking of the african economy to the world economy was more dynamic it brought many changes it helped to increase markets and provided more social opportunities yet social development could not progress very far because the natural basis the popular basis was lacking the new social organization also created new problems education brought us into contact with new cultures a certain number of us assimilated the civilization of other countries and the result was that africa became culturally divided may i quote a personal example i find myself more at home with french friends than with my own elder brother who has never been to school colonization meant that opportunities of advancement were open to a small african elite but the cost was the creation of deep divisions between us materially there was progress but the happiness of man does not come merely from material things it comes from the harmonious development of material and spiritual elements the risk was that a moral vacuum would be created that we should become declasses educated but at home nowhere this is the negative contribution of colonialism evolution which in the precolonial era was vertical now became horizontal the different areas of africa evolved inharmoniously along different lines it was a period of unification military administrative and cultural unification when laws were applied throughout a whole territory the result was to create a positive sense of belonging to a larger community than that of the family or the tribe but it also had the negative result that the unified system was illadapted to meet the real diversity of needs there was a consequent distortion during this phase individual africans benefited from new possibilities of evolution at first they welcomed assimilation because education revealed new horizons but these horizons were always receding the original aim was to achieve equality between rulers and ruled but too often africans found say when elected to the assembly that their problems were as far as ever from a solution another phase followed during which trade unions students associations exservicemens organizations cultural organizations and political parties were formed they constituted an affirmation of the african personality this is not a complete picture but it is a picture of something that we feel deeply even if we cannot always express these feelings articulately there followed a third stage in which we realized that individual expressions of our personality were not enough we had to find collective forms of association because as individuals we could not achieve our objective which was the expression of the african personality this stage is the most important but the most difficult to describe africans believe that the dynamic period of colonialism gave africa a positive means of action our struggle for independence is not negative we want to retain the positive contribution of colonialism the increased contacts and the increased possibilities of exchange that it brought but we want to eliminate its negative aspects africa has we believe potentialities for economic expansion and we believe that independence will be a factor making for stabilization we do not believe that independence will bring a paradise on earth we are conscious of our need to unite and independence is for us a means to that end we are realists we want to increase our understanding of and our cooperation with other peoples to liquidate the disequilibrium that has been created in africa man as a human being must fulfil himself if we cannot create the necessary conditions for ourselves we must create them for those who will come after us this is the real moving force of african nationalism you can afford to oppose nationalism because you have gone through this stage we have not that is the tragedy of our situation what we want is to have laws that are the expression of our own people and this they have not always been an imposed system however good it may be is never valued as much as one that one has created for oneself what is lacking is human dignity of course we in guinea have our problems our country includes many tribes speaking some twenty different languages this is a problem which has to be tackled it is no good shutting ones eyes to the fact of our internal divisions it is better to tackle them head on we must organize the country at first there has naturally been opposition but in two or three or five years our people will have forgotten this we want to be responsible for our own lives one can always give ones brother good advice but he may prefer to make his own mistakes that is the african psychology and it is another reason why we are nationalists whatever people may say nationalism is psychologically inevitable and we are all nationalists what we africans are seeking is justice and equality let me give you an example of what i mean an employer may decide to pay a wage of 1000 francs even though he knows that the minimum wage is only 500 francs everybody will be happy at getting double the rate but if there is inequality between one worker and another the whole relationship within the group will be affected this is a human problem that the employer does not understand he sees only that he is paying double rates but what the african is interested in is equality at the present time we are also seeking liberty because it is a moral force we want to say what we please but improperly used this liberty can be dangerous we must be sure that we are facing the facts however disagreeable they may be if problems are not properly presented then things will go badly because we shall not have the conviction to overcome our problems on the whole we have the same aims we all believe in trade unionism but we have all understood that trade union action alone is not enough we must use it as a political as well as an economic weapon these are two facets of what is really the same purpose the first problem we have to tackle is the general one of organizing unified political action through trade unions particular problems can come later formerly we were divided some of us were in unions affiliated to the wftu some in christian unions some in those affiliated to the icftu i was myself a member of the cgt which was affiliated to the wftu but we wanted a united african movement taking no account of racial differences a movement whose primary aim would be the achievement of independence and whose secondary objective would be the safeguarding of the interests of the workers you will note that i put the political aim first and that we are seeking to achieve it through the trade unions that is an expression of our psychology at the present time all our trade unions are now political and all are working for independencein togoland and throughout the former territories of west and equatorial africa we also include some trade unions from british territories which were formerly affiliated to the icftu but which at the last conference of the union generate du travail dafrique noire decided in principle to join us a trade union leader from ghana has been made vicepresident some moroccan and tunisian trade unions also decided at conakry on union with us we do not want this to be a negative organization we want to make a positive contribution towards the development of our countries and we realize that ideological quarrels will not help we must have a concrete programme and fight for it actively we have drawn up our programme in cooperation with trade unions throughout the world we exclude none any trade union is free to send representatives to guinea to discuss our problems with us and if they can help us so much the better at present europe is busy setting up the common market and is anxious to include africa in it we say no we constitute at present too small a market we must first increase our own free market we have nothing against anyone but we prefer freely negotiated agreements and we think it is more honest to say so we are underpopulated and economically backward it is better for us to exploit what we have and to cooperate with anyone who will work with us there are various ways in which we can serve the cause of liberty the most important is in our own country independence is a means to an end and that end is security if we fail to work for that we betray the cause of liberty we are responsible to those for whom we work our aim must be the welfare of our population at the time the loicadre was voted ie 1956 we already used it differently from other territories we sought to create a new mentality if we voted no ie in the 1958 constitutional referendum the reason was precisely that we had developed a new outlook that we had confidence in our own future here are some examples of what we have done since we became independent first we have got rid of antiquated customs in our villages the tribal chiefs were exploiting them for their own ends and so they had ceased to fufil any useful function people were no longer free what we have done is to appeal to the people themselves as against the chief we instituted elected councils and so transformed the village a third of the seats on village councils are reserved for women and many villages have women mayors second we have set up district councils elected by universal suffrage all who are over 21 have the right to vote a district normally includes from 200 to 300 villages peasants are allotted six seats in every ten so that on a council with 40 seats 24 will go to the peasants the educated have no advantage over the uneducated before independence there were twelve parties in guinea today there is a national front a single party the guinea democratic party those who say that i am a dictator because we have only one party and no opposition do not understand what we are trying to do the party is not an end but a means towards the end which is human freedom at first there was a great deal of disagreement and there was criticism too from outside people said the system would not work but it does and it works democratically in the village all are equal and the majority decides and this has created confidence intellectuals have no privileges all problems are discussed so that everybody can learn to feel that he belongs to the one nation that guinea belongs to us all if you think that this is a dictatorship come and see for yourselves there have been no political trials since independence there is opposition but it is expressed within the party and not from outside this is a different approach because our peasants and workers are practical people who are interested above all in concrete problems we do not discuss marxism but whether to build a bridge or a school and whether to build it here or there one thing we have achieved in guinea is personal security i can quote you one example of this a frenchman i know told me that he felt safer in guinea than he did in certain districts of paris one of our problems is economic development investment is encouraged and our method has been to call a congress of all our organizations throughout guinea and to explain to the delegates exactly what the new plans are and what the consequences would be we explained that at first some 5000 workers would be needed for the new projects but that later on all but about 400 would become redundant and that there was a danger of inflation the result was that when we signed the agreement we all knew what to expect and so nobody could blame us afterwards when the expected consequences materialized at this point m sekou toure interrupted his address in order to provide time for questions among the questions asked were the following qwhat would be the consequences if an opposition were to decide that it wanted to have a separate existence outside the party m sekou toure there is perfect freedom under our constitution for opposition parties to exist but at the last election 91 per cent of the population voted for the guinea democratic party the opposition mustered only 56 per cent of the votes and finally decided to rejoin our party there was reconciliation and two of their leaders were given responsible posts in fact the opposition viewpoint can be much more effectively put from within the party than from outside we are not all agreed inside the party but we express our opinions honestly and in good faith qwhat are the relations of guinea with the cote divoire with ghana and with other african states m sekou toure our relations with ghana are intimate we have had a number of contacts and we shall have further meetings at which decisions will be taken with the cote divoire we have no official relations between our two governments but relations between our peoples are friendly we are also on good terms with other african states qwhat are your own chief resources and what are your chief needs from abroad m sekou toure in a year we have reduced personal taxes by half but national union has enabled us to do far more in the past year than we could have done if we had remained divided each village constitutes an independent sector responsible for taking its own decisions it has its own programme necessarily modest the village decides whether to build a school or a dispensary and so on this imposes no charge on the national budget because our resources are human the work is completed in two to three months in this way we have constructed 8000 kilometres of roads and built 500 schools hundreds of dispensaries and a number of bridges if the village decides to build a road which involves the destruction of somebodys property that property is always rebuilt by the village if there is a fireand that can easily happen as our houses are of strawthe whole village cooperates in the reconstruction our chief capital is human the strange musical genius of blind tom by walter monfried f iftythree years have passed since the death of that most astounding and mysterious of musical prodigies known as blind toma babbling imbecile who could play the piano like an angel upon hearing of toms demise the famous louisville editor marse henry watterson observed i must be his oldest living friend i cannot trust myself to write of him as i feel it is as if some trusty well loved mastiff mute but affectionatehad been taken away what was he whence came he blind deformed black the idiocy of a perpetual frenzy was the sole companion of his waking visions that there was a soul there be sure imprisoned chained in that little black bosom released at last blind tom refuses to be forgotten he bobs up again and again in the public prints this month he receives another high honor he is included in a new supplement to groves dictionary of music and musicians the outstanding encyclopedia of its kind in english the entry begins bethune thomas greene born muscogee county georgia usa may 25 1849 died hoboken n j june 13 1908 american negro musical prodigy known as blind tom how good a player was tom at 17 he moved a baltimore journalist john law to declare i may say without the slightest exaggeration that toms execution of all kinds of musicfrom the classical works of beethoven bach mendelssohn and others down to the simplest plantation melodyis unsurpassed by that of the best performers of the day he was still only 17 when on a european tour he was heard by the celebrated pedagogues ignaz 16 moscheles of vienna and prof h s oakley of edinburgh they called him a wonder of nature all discriminating reviewers agreed that tom had marvelous facility and memory but that he lacked originality of interpretation he could reproduce only what he had heard one may speculate on what he would have done in a phonographic age with gieseking and horowitz for models tom was the 21st child of his mother a slave his parents were unlettered field hands but surely with music in their souls when he was a babe in arms his mother went upon the block and was sold to gen thomas greene bethune owner of a plantation near columbus ga the child was thrown in for nothing because he was sightless and of low mentality from infancy he revealed an overpowering passion for music at the age of 2 he would creep up on the bethune porch and listen to the girls singing inside even then he was a remarkable mimic he could sing whatever he had heard and in the manner of the singer high or low male or female when tom was 4 the bethunes acquired a piano tom was playing near the house spinning about on his hands and heels a lifetime recreation of his when he first heard the strange new sounds he was entranced he hid in the bushes around the porch and stayed there until the girls left the piano room then he stole in found the keyboard and duplicated the sounds he had heard tom always roamed by night he would sneak out of his mothers cabin and wander for hours when he returned he would emulate vocally the noises of storms rustling leaves cattle and so on at other times he would steal into the bethune parlor at midnight and play the piano until dawn the bethunes immediately recognized his gift and encouraged it the oldest daughter a fairly good pianist started to teach him but soon discovered that he could do everything she knew and much better then gen bethune engaged the communitys best players and teachers to work with the boy and again tom showed he could duplicate anything he had heard when tom was 8 his owner took him on tour at louisville he was heard by a showman william henry palmer an excellent pianist who also was a professional magician under the name of heller palmer realized that here was a first rate attraction he began to enlarge toms repertory he played many pieces for him and tom played them back more expertly than his mentor and what tom learned he never forgot henry watterson was a 19 year old reporter when he first heard tom then aged 10 watterson himself was a pianist of talent but a hand injury and partial blindness ended his keyboard studies he remained a lifelong lover of music at first hearing watterson was dumfounded by toms abilities and eccentricities and he never ceased to marvel at them in his memoirs written many years later he recalled tom had heard stephen douglas speak in congress and he could repeat many of the sentences after he heard a soprano he repeated her songs a tennessee baritone taught him rocked in the cradle of the deep a tenor in griffin ga taught him some love songs tom could duplicate all of them his imitations from bass to soprano were startlingly lifelike he was blind and clearly an idiot in short he was a prodigy when another pianist was playing tom would spin about like a baboon as watterson put it when his turn came he pounced upon the instrument and tried to play what he had heard two or three lessons were enough for him to learn a short piece tom had unusual powers of improvisation too after the civil war tom chose to remain with the bethunes who always were kind to him in his 40 year concert career under their direction he earned 200000 about 5000 a year when the costs of travel lessons and escorts are considered it is obvious that no one profited heavily on his prowess toms vaudeville act was truly unusual he sang in several registers in addition to playing the piano as a windup he stood with his back to the keyboard played a hornpipe with one hand and with the other he pounded out patriotic airs on the piano then members of the audience were invited to the stage and asked to play anything several would respond and offer little numbers tom emulated readily in philadelphia when tom was 37 the invitation to the audience was accepted by anna amalie tutein a concert pianist and teacher she played a difficult excerpt from a beethoven concerto and tom was stumped the bethunes realized that tom had a lot to learn and hired mme tutein to instruct him at 5 a lessona sizable fee in the 1880s it was a distasteful task mme tutein recalled long afterward tom had grown fat he literally ate like a hog and he fought fiercely against being washed and bathed i must dispel the idea that tom could repeat anything after having heard it once she related the lessons were two hours long and it was often necessary for me to play the compositions 50 times before he would acquire them i would feed him 8 or 10 measures at a time then he would play them over several times and we would go on with others after he had a fair impression of the piece i would play it in entirety and he would listen intently in this way tom memorized many of the difficult works of beethoven liszt chopin men18 delssohn and other masters he was not a complete automaton he could ask a fairly intelligible question such as whether a note was a fourth or an eighth he knew the names of each pitch a b c etc and he had the gift of absolute pitch the instructor could not carry on a conversation with him however when he replied yes to a question she knew he did not understand when he really did understand he hissed and quivered nor was his playing completely mechanical he did more than mirror the playing of others his teacher revealed he could put expression and individuality into his performance he had a sturdy elastic technique and great accuracy toms custody which became an issue in the courts eventually passed to mrs albert t lerche the widow of a son of gen bethune in his last years he made his home in her hoboken apartment and toured in vaudeville at 59 he suffered a stroke which left one arm useless and the other impaired he stumbled to the piano tried to play and managed only a few discords tom cant play no mo he muttered as he wept a few days later he was at the piano again singing softly then he sobbed ise all done missus and fell to the floor dead second class soldiers by rabbi paul h levenson now see here chaplain the deputy post commander scowled all this running around and poking your nose into things you have no business to is only going to get you into trouble he swung around in his chair and smiled wryly at me this was the third time id been invited into the generals office because of my activity on behalf of negro soldiers the colonel his deputy knew me well enough by now to smile why dont you publish all this in your memoirs when you get out of service he suggested for heavens sake dont print anything now his plea was an order and i had to accept it since i was only a chaplain 1st lt but i remembered his facetious suggestion and took it seriously i swore then and there to tell the story of how the negro soldier still suffers from the insanity of segregation in spite of the fact that the army proudly proclaims itself integrated its the story also of a handful of brave people who tried to right the wrongs committed against a sizeable number of our nations soldiers first the setting by far the largest number of permanent army bases are located in the south the liberal clergyman who lives down south by choice knows he must lock horns with strongly conservative elements who have psychological and often monetary investments in the maintenance of the segregated status quo he has to deal with them bargain cajole appeal to their consciences cry out 20 in the name of god all for the purpose of trying to allow a fellow human being to buy a tuna fish sandwich and a cup of coffee at a local drugstore the bigger issues of segregated schools housing and transportation will be decided by the courts meanwhile the liberal clergyman tries to create a climate of opinion favorable to the cause of civil_rights the liberal clergyman in the army who wants to back up his pulpit convictions with actions discovers that even in peacetime commanding generals object strongly to activists whom he thinks are rocking the militarycivilian goodwill boat within the limits of the southern army base everything is integrated on post housing is given to qualified soldiers on a firstcomefirstserve basis cafeterias post exchanges the racial composition of companies and battalions all are integrated even the town high schools are integrated because the government says they must or be turned down in their application for federal funds the army is integrated because it was ordered to do so about 10 years ago as a social experiment it can be termed an unqualified success despite individual experiences of overt or covert discrimination some men dont like it but they take it because they know there is no choice civilians who work on the particular southern army base at lege in florida while i paid for it by being in the army she graduated in june but cant get a job here in this town as a high school physics teacher thats what shes trained for actually she would take any teaching job at all the colored grammar school has enough teachers and the other ones in town would never hire her several of my friends wives taught in the town school system because many army wives teach there is an extraordinary turnover when their husbands are shipped out the schools need steady teachers so badly that a bonus of 30000 is given to any teacher who stays on one full year the negro soldier went on to explain that his wife could get no job at all in town not even as a department store counter girl which pays 500 an hour for an 8 hour day without the extra income it would be difficult to pay the high rents in the negro housing district rents there are 2000 more than comparable homes in the main part of town this mans case is typical and no exaggeration discrimination in offduty hours employment is quite trying on negro soldiers families since they use the money to supplement their skimpy cash income while the u s soldiers pay is quite good the actual cash received is not sufficient for building up a reserve the government calculates that medical benefits for families are worth a considerable amount and they take this into ac22 count when estimating total income another unseen benefit is retirement pay this is in effect deducted from the monthly pay and reduces the cash payments proportionately because of these reasons and the natural one of wanting more money to save or spend many soldiers work a few nights each week or wives might work during the day in this way they earn an extra 15002000 each year in addition to their army pay a sum equal to onethird their entire cash income per year the negro soldier and his wife though just as qualified as their white counterparts have no equality of opportunity in obtaining this outside work in southern towns this causes great hardship to many families but the army says it cant interfere with the policies of the local community and shrugs an apology the unfairness of this and other discriminatory practices particularly in the area of housing puts the liberal to the test i asked myself as a jewish rabbi could i practice in the south what i had preached so securely in long island new york less than 4 months before and with the added burden of being in the army and subject to its restrictions i felt that the least i should do is try to contact others and organize something to alleviate these conditions so unfavorable to the negro their wives and little children to live there some negro soldiers prefer not to have their families living in red light and high crime areas the results are nothing short of tragic ive met many such men their wives cant get jobs they dont want their children to shift from wellequipped and well staffed schools in unsegregated areas to the usually run down schools with the poorly trained teachers of the negro segregated school some of these negro soldiers decide to live alone in barracks far from their loved ones such separations have a demoralizing effect on the men and their families the assignment in the states for at least 18 months is supposed to be favorable duty when a soldier goes to korea he cant take his family along anyone with less than five years in the army cant possibly afford to transport his family and household goods to europe to add to these long forced separations another 18 months if a negro is assigned to a southern base and the situation becomes very tense some of these men go for years without spending more than a 30 day leave at home with their wives and children every now and then they cant take them overseas with them and they have enough respect for them that they wont permit them to live in red light districts when assigned to a southern post 24 we interviewers found disturbing problems confronting those who decided to stay in the negro section of the town close to the base there were 80 fairly decent units built with the help of a federal housing administration loan adjacent to this development which was rapidly deteriorating because of lack of adequate repairs was a closely spaced trailer camp of a similar number of units another area across the main highway into town was literally a shanty town of slapped together boards and tin cans even there some sections were restricted the development located on the hill was about a mile outside of town two miles from the main shopping area and three miles from the camp itself the houses and the trailer camps were planted with little thought given to the intended occupants comforts or conveniences not a single store of any type was opened on the hill since the development was too small to support it buses refuse to negotiate the hill to pick up people mothers without cars must take a taxi into town and back for a bottle of milk repairs were rarely made inadequate fire hydrants were noted there was insufficient street lighting in comparison with other parts of town and roads were not oiled down to keep them from being washed away though the grammar school on the army base is integrated the grammar school on the hill is de facto segregated the high schools in town are integrated the only ones that are in a radius of hundreds of miles the reason for these exceptions is the requirement that federal aid to schools which are used by dependents of large numbers of government employees can be given only if the local school district integrates its schools though the local school board is strongly segregationist they just couldnt afford to be in this case the negro grammar school on the hill though brand new is staffed only with negro teachers these teachers though dedicated dont receive the training and education in their southern negro teachers colleges that caucasians do in their caucasian teachers colleges its worth while noting that the few white soldiers families who live on one part of the hill send their young children to the grammar school in town by public school bus the net result is that government funds are being used to support segregated schooling i spoke to those segregated souls on the hill at a sunday church service i had arranged for their minister to talk to the jewish group during brotherhood week the sermon i gave was an impassioned plea to the minister and the congregation to organize themselves as the jews of america had done and fight discrimination with the strength of man they could appeal to the religious feelings of their fellow christians an avenue of approach that had borne results in other cities the sermon was received politely to their surprise i returned the love offering to their mission fund of the church and never heard a word from them thereafter plainly these people were unable to work for themselves they were sufficiently cowed that they would not raise a voice of protest even though they knew the truth of what i had said word of everything the committee members did was brought back to the commanding general by a spy an officer attached to division headquarters he gave us little sermons at our biweekly gettogethers about the dangers involved their illegality the fact that the general was aware of our existence and his strong disapproval the rest of us were resolved to continue though the danger of being expelled from the service for doing so became increasingly real the lone negro chaplain dropped out after the second meeting he had penned a hasty note to the commander of the wac garrison accusing her of keeping the wac barracks segregated this is what several girls had told him the commanding general was informed of the letter and had the chaplain on the carpet warning him to avoid all involvement with integrationist activity meanwhile i had invited the commanding general to my home he and his wife graciously attended despite his knowledge of my activities we spent much of the evening discussing the housing situation though the general finally cut it short with the unforgettable bellow i want you to remember sir the majority has rights too the final report was submitted to members of the committee who signed it included among them were 30 per cent of the forts 20 chaplains addressed to the commanding general it concluded the negro soldier although wishing to serve the army and his country to the best of his ability finds it difficult to do so under such adverse circumstances we hope that you will give this grave problem your prayerful consideration and we would respectfully suggest that the committee be formed to study this housing problem and if the above report is verified recommend to the city officials that they discuss with the owners of rental property the advisability of integrated housing in their comunities the report was never made officially when the general heard that it was about to be sent up to him he called the members of the committee into his office and warned them not to send it he had seen it unofficially and disapproved of it notices were printed in the daily bulletin reemphasizing a regulation prohibiting all unauthorized organizations which had to be approved by the command before they could be allowed to exist at the base our committee on housing ceased never to be revived officially or unofficially the episcopalian minister from town continued on in his work trying individual persuasion with town realtors but achieved very little i arranged material for him gathered from american jewish congress pamphlets on the myth of negroes destroying property values otherwise we had been silenced effectively the remedies for the illness of segregation in an army town must be stronger than a few foolhardy and idealistic soldiers and an occasional sermon by a chaplain about brotherhood publication of the facts such as these will help a sitin at a southern army base was reported by drew pearson in his syndicated column this past july this had them buzzing in the pentagon there are many high ranking officers who are decent people who want to see these insults to united states soldiers wiped out forever but they cannot act alone it will take public pressure lots of it to drive home to the men who have it within their power to change these conditions to do so as soon as possible have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother the day i discovered i was colored by louie robinson t he day of the great discovery had that special lemoncolored quality which seemed to me to come only to texas summers it was bright and fresh and offered boundless opportunities for baseball crawdading mumble peg stick horse or picking cars the latter was a game we played by lining up on the sidewalk taking turns from one through whatever number of us there were and any automobile that passed during your turn was yours in those days in my part of town the cars didnt come along too fast i left home early that morning after a breakfast of oatmeal with cornflakes a compromise menu since my grandmother had insisted i needed something hot for all the energy i burned up and i wanted the com flakes because they were the same kind all those baseball football and golf stars ate the system seemed pretty simple to me eat the corn flakes and grow up to be a champion but then what did the name bob feller mean to my grandmother anyway i beat it out of there fast that morning before somebody started some jazz or other about me making up my bed or dusting the living room furniture boy i hated dusting i hightailed it up the alley to the mulberry tree on second street to meet the guys puddin head shultz was already there whittling on a stick when i ran up boy i bet that guy got up earlier than anybody in the whole world whenever we went hiking or fishing or something real early puddin head was the one who came around and woke everybody up his talents pretty much ended there whatcha doin i asked him for openers man im whittlin me a stick he answered whatcha makin i asked i aint makin nothin he said im whittlin me a stick it was a good conversation but i decided not to overdo it 28 i sat around silently watching puddin head for a few minutes until stinky higgins came along stinky was our cultural leader not only because at nine he was a couple of years older than most of the rest of us but he could also lick any kid in the block besides he was the only one in the bunch who knew how to cuss puddin head quit whittling his stick long enough to look up and yell hi stinky showing the kind of respect that a leader deserves hey stinky puddin heads whittlin him a stick i said figuring id bring him up to date on the mornings activities as quickly as possible hi puddin head stinky said with a grin then he looked at me and didnt say anything and his grin quit whats your problem i asked in surprise he was just standing there looking at me kind of funny and i figured maybe he wanted to fight or something it was okay with me but i couldnt see much point in fighting that early in the morning when there wasnt even anybody around yet but puddin head i couldnt whip stinky but at least the crowd always pulled for me in a fight because i was only seven and smaller than most of the other guys besides i won a lot of fights while i was standing there trying to decide whether i should just go on and sock stinky one first and then take my chances he said suddenly youre a damned spook aint cha a what puddin head asked looking up like i said in the world of semantics stinky was light years ahead of the rest of us he was still looking at me waiting for my answer i dont know i said you mean like a ghost or somethin naw i mean a spookspook stinky said look at cha youre black i looked at me im not black im brown i said black brown high yellowa spooks a spook stinky persisted who told you that puddin head wanted to know my old man stinky said he came home sober last night did your old man really come home sober puddin head asked yeah stinky said sitting down on the ground under the tree with us we thought he was sick or something anyway he told us all about colored people whats colored people i asked him youre colored people stinky said didnt your folks ever tell you not that i remember i said whats there to tell well stinky answered things like how you people can all sing and dance and stuff like that but youre not much good at readin and writin and figurin what the heck i said i negro digest december 1961 showed you how to read and write way last year my grandfather had taught me when i was four well we dont have any colored kids in our school cause theyre too dumb to keep up with us stinky scooped up a handful of mulberries off the ground and bit into them and the dark red juice squirted down the side of his mouth he wiped it away with his shirtsleeve besides he continued spooks aint very clean man my grandmother makes me bathe twice a week i protested we bathe at our house on saturday nights puddin head said every saturday night stinky asked most every saturday night puddin head said hygiene wasnt one of our favorite subjects so we soon got back to the heart of the conversation my old man says that hell if you go out of town on a damned bus or something stinky continued showing his mastery of profanity they make all the colored people ride in the back of it the hell you say i cut in i didnt know how to cuss and i had never ridden a bus but i figured that if when i did get on one i was going to have to ride in the back of it now was as good a time to start cussing as any where would i ride puddin head asked aint you listenin stinky demanded wed ride up front i was beginning not to like this at all so i decided to change the subject lets go swimmin i suggested my mother says shell whale the daylights out of me if she catches me goin swimmin again puddin head said lets race down to the fire plug it wont do any good stinky said matteroffactly whatcha mean it wont do any good puddin head said loudly you sure are talkin nutty today it just wont do any good for us to race down to the fire plug thats all stinky answered patientlv looies a spook aint he hell win they can all run faster than we can its somethin they got in their heels how come the last time we raced down to the fire plug i beat him a mile puddin head demanded are you callin my old man a damned liar stinky said hotly look maybe your old man just said all that because he was sober puddin head said he probably wont even remember it anymore besides if you dont like looie how come you live right across the street from him my old man says thats the difference in down south and livin up north down here we have houses together a lot but up north all the colored people live in one section of town what for puddin head asked 30 stinky ignored him but said to me and another thing stay away from my sister your sister i exploded boy i wish youd keep your dumb sister from over at my house playin with my fire engines and stuff leavin her dolls all over the place who wants to be bothered with your dumb sister boy that really burned me up his crummy sister was one big pain in the neck the only nice thing i could say about her was that she was still straight and hard like a boy and hadnt started getting all soft and lumpy like some of the older girls just thinking about girls made me so mad i had to crawl up in the mulberry tree to cool off while i was up there i decided i might as well do something useful so i picked all the berries i could stuff in my pockets without them bursting and staining my clothes and then i climbed back down the tree lets eat some berries i said pulling out a couple of hands full you gonna eat right here with us puddin head asked like he was suddenly getting the message where the hell you think im gonna eat in back of the tree i demanded i handed stinky his berries first in deference to his leadership then i handed some to puddin head and sat down on the ground with them and we ate tomorrow stinky said leaning back against the tree weve juot got to get segregated the bonus boy of boxing by lew eskin s ince boxing became part of the olympic games in 1904 five boxers who gained olympic championships have won world championships as professionals frankie genaro fidel labarba and pascual perez among the flyweights jackie fields among the welterweights and floyd patterson present heavyweight champion the wee ones competed as flyweights in the international games while fields won the featherweight title and patterson the middleweight crown only one other olympic champion ever even gained a shot at a world championship that boxer of course was pete rademacher who won the heavyweight title in 1956 at melbourne and who in his first professional bout clashed with floyd patterson after having floyd on the floor pete was knocked out in the sixth round out of last years games in rome there are two young men who have made rapid strides since turning pro both are competing as heavyweights francisco depiccoli of italy who won the olympic heavyweight title has run off a string of nine straight wins seven of them by knockouts since he made his debut last december and cassius clay of louisville ky who gained the light heavyweight title in rome also has a clean slate cassius who made his pro debut in his home town last october has moved up faster than has depiccoli in clays most recent bout he scored a triumph over experienced alonzo johnson in his national tv debut it was also his eighth straight victory with five of these coming via the knockout route clay who is nineteen has boasted that he will win the heavyweight title before his twentyfirst birthday while that is a difficult goal his background gives him a good chance to achieve his goal as an amateur he won top honors in every tournament he entered and compiled a record of over 100 wins against a mere eight losses with most of those defeats coming during his first year of boxing it was an odd accident that caused him to turn to boxing when he was twelve years old he attended a basketball game at columbia hall in louisville and when he left the place he discovered that his bicycle had been stolen he asked where he could find a policeman and was told that there was one in the gym going downstairs he found joe martin the boxing director of the police boys club conducting a class he tearfully told joe of his stolen bike and what we would do to the guy who took it martin called in a report on the theft then asked clay if he knew 32 how to fight no said cassius brushing away a tear well you ought to come around here and learn so that you can take care of that guy if you find him advised martin learn how to protect yourself cassius did come back and it was martin who turned him into one of the top amateur boxers of recent years cassius last year won both the national aau and golden gloves championships he boxed as a light heavyweight in the aau tourney and a heavyweight in the golden gloves due to the fact that under aau rules the weight limit is a 178 pounds against 175 in the golden gloves a strapping six foot two inch lad with a rapier like left jab cassius scaled 186 pounds for his first bout in which he won a six round decision over veteran tunney hunnsacker clay scaled 192 pounds for his last fight with alonzo johnson following the victory over hunsacker clay scored five knockouts in a row stepping up in class with each victory he halted herb siler in four tony esperti in three jim robinson in one and donnie fleeman in seven fleeman had previously kayoed former heavyweight champion ezzard charles and beaten willi besmanoff in clays next fight he kayoed lamar clark in two rounds then he outpointed big duke sabedong in ten in las vegas sabedong an experienced ringman who stands six feet six scaled 226 against 194 pounds for clay and proved a tough nut for the youngster although clay was unable to knock his man out he won easily against johnson another crafty boxer cassius showed signs of his lack of experience but his natural ability was more than enough to make up the difference and he again won although it was a unanimous verdict clay did not show the ability to make good his boast of winning the title within two years while he was in florida he worked as a sparring partner with ingemar johansson when the swede was training for his match with floyd patterson and clay impressed ingo and the press with his quick hands and footwork hes good this fellow johansson said after a sparring session he did a lot of jumping around and isnt a bit like patterson as he changes around too much i hope i can get him for more sparring as he sharpens me up others who have been impressed by the abilities of clay include ray robinson archie moore and the ring editor nat fleischer who saw him in all his rome olympic bouts cassius is the great great grandson of a slave who borrowed the name of his owner cassius marcellus clay who was the u s ambassador to russia and a relative of the famed henry clay the fighters father is also named cassius clay when he won the gold medal in rome clay was walking on a cloud i didnt take that medal off for two days said clay i even wore it to bed i didnt sleep too good because i had to sleep on my back so that the medal wouldnt cut me but i didnt care i was olympic champion he bought a bar and grill in louisville which was called the club havana but he changed the name to the club olympic his father is operating the place for him when he decided to become a professional clay signed a contract with a group of business men who set up a corporation to manage him this corporation paid him 10 000 for signing and he will receive 4000 a year for the next two years then if the options are exercised 6000 a year for the following four years he will also receive fifty percent of his ring purses plus training and travelling expenses on the rapid advance he has made in the ten months he has been a pro it looks like these who signed him were real sharp business men and that the olympic medal may not be the only gold that cassius will possess aside from liston machen and johnson clay feels he is ready for any of the others if he sticks to his timetable of winning the championship before 1963 he will have to step out by next summer right now he has shown that he has the ability to handle the top grade men but how he would do against the ranking fighters is something which has to be answered true the present crop of heavyweights is far from the best but they are a crew with plenty of experience no matter how he fares young

haiti for example in many respects the haitian and the american negro share the same cultural seed but of course haiti affords a more fertile soil for the cultivation of the african seed portauprince haitis capital is by no means a sleepy hollow remote entirely from noise and the bustle of the world its citizens while preserving a certain haitian simplicity in their manners and institutions have acquired a wide knowledge of other peoples from the tourist trade commercial and diplomatic relations then here too one will find the usual portable bootblacks cunning street venders and aspirant city slickers the streets are full of friendly people and their language culture and cuisine is french with african modifications i found haiti drenched in rum poetry music and art the rum is the best in the west indies the poetry is not bad the music is exciting and the art is primitive but we must leave all this city life for my unusual experience in haiti in the past several years haitian voodoo has acquired a notoriety which has prevented serious study of it most people have associated the term voodoo with zombies weird and sometimes orgiastic mysteries the tourist accepts the fake ceremonies staged for them and the haitian elite disclaims any knowledge of it but with the haitian peasant and the poor town folk it is a serious and sacred matter among the peasants survives a form of worship in which catholic and african cult practices are forged into one of the most discussed rituals in the western world my friend and guide marcel had learned that a special service was being held not too far from carrefour a town a little more than a half hours drive from the city of portauprince the ceremony was not to begin until late in the evening so i suggested to marcel that we stop by the casino before we drove to carrefour the casino is where many tourists go to try their luck at the wheel and many others go to view haiti through the bottom of a rum glass 36 i decided to take a taxi to the casino a hazardous ride it turned out to be the driver hurled into the midst of pedestrians and running children shouted and snarled insults in creole to all those who barred his path i held on to my seat for dear life after a few minutes of this i was virtually thrown out in front of the casino drenched with perspiration and fright weakly i went into my pockets to pay the daredevil there i was kept busy several minutes more while i searched through a roll of filthy wrinkled haitian banknotes and tormenting little coins before i drew out one gourde to pay the driver a gourde is about twenty cents in american money une table pour deux i addressed the waiter near our table i observed two american girls prowling like jaguars very soon they caught the attention of a haitian playboy and immediately they began pecking out high school french in huntandpeck fashion i later noticed a very dignified haitian gentleman weaving around the tables and singing pour le drapeau la patrie i recognized the tune as the first bars of the national anthem of haiti as he ended on maurir est beau he stood towering above my table and without the slightest provocation he addressed me pardon monsieur what will america do when castro takes over her base in cuba his real intent was of a subtle nature there was a moment of silence from all the tables nearby i merely stared at him my american ego was ruffled and i didnt know exactly the best thing to say at the critical moment it was marcel who came to my rescue he suggested we had better be going now you dont have much time for talk dear old marcel after we reached carrefour we still had about three miles to walk we had to climb a rough winding mountain path there were no available roads leading to the site of the service very soon the only neon sign on the main road in carrefour blinking hesitantly was left far behind we had only the moon and the stars to guide us we walked about a mile before i heard the faint beat of a drum in the far distance after stumbling over the rocky path that led up the mountainside a climb that seemed to have lasted for hours we finally came to the top of the mountain the drums were quite near now when we reached the hurriedly erected hut the service was already in progress a voodoo ceremony permits expression of the haitians most original art formssinging dancing and drumming traditional songs dances and drum beats are associated with the different types of worship service the ceremony itself has a definite form there is little opportunity for variation or testimony as practiced in many of the american rebel and splinter churches many of the ceremonies held in portauprince and its environs are faked for the tourists but a haitian drummer cannot fake he must play the threeman percussion battery this night were playing for a mange loa rite the feasting of the gods it is necessary to replenish occasionally the source of energy of the gods which is constantly drawn from them by their worshippers the most common offerings are chickens pigeons ducks goats and pigs a woman garbed in white wearing a tightly bound white cotton cloth around her head raised a banana leaf toward the sky she then oriented it that is she pointed it in the four cardinal directions as she turned to each point she chanted dieu le pere dieu le fils dieu le saint esprit et les myssteries in the name of the god the father of my spirits and my gods as she stood there erect and tense i was deeply moved by the sincerity of her poignant invocation the drummers had churned up a beady sweat and already their bodies were drenched in perspiration as i watched the strange cabalistic figures being drawn upon the ground instinctively and passionately my body began to sway i sat there swaying and trying hard to recall some strange familiar beat once lost in the recesses of my body i caught hold of myself for the moment and looked around for marcel i discovered him on the far side of the hut dancing in the circle of worshippers in a voodoo ceremony the bodies of the dancers never touch marcel caught my sharp gaze and i believe he gave me a rather encouraging nod to join in the service the drums were becoming louder now my head became dizzy and my body was hot again i thought once that i might faint au nom du pere et du fils et du saint esprit gan yin bon dieu in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost there is a god the chorus of women were singing now in the midst of this invocation a hellish shriek went up from a man rolling on the ground he had become possessed possession is a most important phenomenon in voodoo the behavior of the people when they are possessed has a theatrical quality when a god enters the head or mounts a person the others are entertained by his spiritual catalepsis the whole personality of a mounted person is changed during the state of possession he is then in a state to converse with the gods and even with deceased persons one cannot listen very long to haitian drums without being moved in some manner by their infectious rhythm i began to wonder if it were possible for me to become possessed i began swaying again 38 and i joined in the hand clapping the thin veneer of civilization was cracking it seemed as the insistent drums radioed their message my feet voluntarily began moving haiti was absorbing me possessed now i could feel the beat of the drums synchronizing with my heart beat and flowing in my blood africa was calling from the marrow of my bones and i was answering the prodigal son had returned the drums were urging the body to dance some strange suppressed metaphysical powers were demanding satisfaction the tempo of the drums increased the voodoo priest began to dance slowly at first the drums and the singing went on and on getting faster and wilder dominating the hearts and the feet of all the circle most of the worshippers were now trembling and shivering some had dropped to the ground and lay there as in a trance everyone seemed possessed by the frenzy of the drums the spirits of their ancestors were surely abroad tonight in complete surrender i found myself upon the floor my feet were following some strange step i suddenly became conscious that the drums had changed their beats and most of the dancers had left the circle and then a glassyeyed mambo a high priestess in voodoo hierarchy bounced into the room her body began to move like an angry snake and at otner times like an olympic star her hips undulated and rotated in accelerated rhythms and the violent jerks of her head threatened to dislocate her cervical vertebrae her serpentine movements sent writhing waves from her head to her feet then pandemonium broke out everyone was singing and jumping about wildly the whole hut was sent suddenly a most terrifying shriek shocked me back to my senses it was then that i noticed that marcel was standing by my side grinning and sweating profusely when my heartbeat had sufficiently slowed to render speech audible i turned to him lets get out of here i urged him i had just witnessed the first part of a most unusual ceremony also my first and last lesson in the catechism of island voodoo i had been baptised in its nocturnal rhythm as we dragged down the road into carrefour already the solid walls of the tropical heat was holding the early morning in her molten arms i raised my eyes and looked back over the hills bursting from their primitive shells the source of haitian comfort nowhere do men live closer to hills that sustain and embrace them please hurry and get a taxi i pleaded to marcel my feet are sore marcel looked at me proudly and repeated an old creole proverb apre das tabou toujou lou when the dance is over the drum is always heavy as i settled back in the taxi en route back to the city i thought i heard the faint beat of a drum and possibly i did drums will always play in haiti today as yesterday tomorrow and always in washington d c by haynes johnson negro at the lowest level of income and education feels cut off niy from socy but from many within his own race he is the true outsider in washington he believes that those in his race who hold good jobs and live in decent homes have turned their backs on him he and thousands like him comprise what is for want of a better termthe lower class of negroes that the negro has distinct classes with all of the accompanying friction and antagonism that the word implies should come as no surprise there are class structures in all groups within the negro population however the classes are particularly complicated there is a group within our racethey call themselves the educated group or the upper crust and they feel they are better than the rest of us a government worker said they actually build barriers within our own race what are these barriers one of the most important is also the most subtle it has to do with the word negro itself and what that word means youll meet many people in washington who will not use the word negro a distinguished negro educator said its a bad word so many painful memories are associated with it they might say colored but they might not even say that they almost try to deny such a race exists those scars are part of the experience of the negro some negroes will argue there are middle and upper class groups that are divorced from the problems of their race these people live in good homes insulated by their own small social groups they are not fighting for their race they are afraid of anything which might upset their status you see a young negro minister said when you reach the plateau of the middle class you dont want to rock the boat you dont want to disturb the situation especially once youre looked on as a socially desirable class until the middle and the upper classes realize that what happens to the lower classes affects them too no matter how much money or status they have you arent really going to be able to solve the problem from within theyre out of contact with the other groups he said they dont have to come home to one room and not know where the next meal is coming from they dont really feel these things and so they dont understand is this true negroes who have studied the problem say it is this reporter can only say he has been in some homes where it appears to be true in fairness though this has not been a common experience the negro intellectual is especially concerned about this problem he will say that often negroes who have risen to fivefigure incomesand there are many in this category in washingtonseem to wish to disassociate from the race they even will look down on negro folk music and literature a negro scholar says this reflects an attitude of second generation respectability i think its a weakness he said it tends to break down the connection between the educated and the lower groups bessie smith mahalia jackson people like that are honored in the community for their way of singing the people understand it its a part of their culture why should it be denied theres too much hypersensitivity about too many things a businessman said we are confronted with an entirely new type of opposition from a group which mistakenly identifies itself as the new negro he defined this kind of person as the selfefficient arrogant smug and underexposed individual who feels he has arrived his basic shortcoming lies in his desire to disassociate and his failure to share his knowledge with people of his own race who he feels are not up to standards that he now knows a negro sociologist tells about talking to a woman in this economic and social group who had watched louis armstrong on television the night before wasnt that terrible she said i said no why she said oh you know he doesnt look right she meant he was too black then i said i think hes an artist and we should be proud of him she still thought they should have got someone else at howard university one student has several charcoal sketches 42 of negroes on his dormitory wall they portray negro men and women with prominent negroid features you see those the student said pointing to the wall you know what many of the boys say when they see them they say oh those are terrible they mean theyre too negroid i keep them there as my private form of psychoanalysis for the others these attitudes still are factors in the colored classes in washington although their importance has diminished greatly in recent years thats what a colored man meant when he said the negroes in washington had to do their own integrating after 1954 at one time the shade of a mans skin played a significant role among the negro population in the capital this was a heritage from slavery days when the lightskinned negro was given advantages over the man with a darker skin i think today there is a little less emphasis on color among negroes a businessman who was born and educated in washington said but its hard to change the habit of years of tradition back in the old days the negro developed what im sure you heard of as a bastard aristocracy my own father was a mulatto for instance and lived in a certain class color became almost a caste both economically and socially to be a mulatto almost always identified you with a powerful white family those children had more opportunities they were sent away to school and formed their own societies in the northern cities usually they intermarried with each other to maintain the masquerade some of them were able to pass for whites it meant of course they had more advantages this is not so true today but it is true that many of the really old washington families actually resented integration to put it personally my mother was one of those shes rather stiffnecked about it who are these people in the better classes they are the same as in any group status is determined by money and education at the top are the professional groups the doctors lawyers teachers businessmen and highranking government employes in the middle is a large group of government workers merchants and ministers in many of these families the wife works and the husband has a second job so they can buy a home in a decent section at the bottom are the unskilled laborers i think your slum dwellers today are very sharply divided from your bourgeoisie a scholar said your professional groups have cliques there is your clash todaybetween the laborers and recent migrants from the south and the washington middle class expressing it another way its the old story that the lower classes are jealous and well they might be negroes will tell you with justifiable pride that this city has a better standard of living from the negro point of view than any other city in the united statesor in the world for that matter in the higher brackets the negro in washington may earn up to 100000 a year a negro businessman said for those who have been able to take advantage of the opportunities here the material rewards are visible the most striking is the neighborhood where the wealthiest negroes live in the far northwest off sixteenth street near the carter barron amphitheater and rock creek park this section is enviously called the gold coast certain sections seem to denote certain standards a colored man said for instance i live in brookbnd in northeast washington off rhode island avenue and they will say oh you live with the rich negro its the same way with the gold coast where the richest negroes live when the phrase gold coast was mentioned to a man who lives there he smiled and said yes i know that the other negroes call this the gold coast there are some who call this the negros spring valley well since this is the best area thats the reason we guard it just as jealously as they do in spring valley or wesley heights were not snobbish thats not it but look at it this way why put a big price on a home if youre going to allow the neighborhood to deteriorate no no one up here is snobbish although i guess there are negroes in other parts of town who think so a housewife on that street told how worried everyone was because a family who left southwest because of the redevelopment moved in next to the church on the corner and we are all quite upset about the appearance of the yard the man sits out on the porch in his overalls they are a more rural type of family not the way other people here are as you go down the economic ladder you will hear similar comments here are some certainly theres a difference among negroes its not snobbery but lets face it if a person isnt of the same background as you you dont even get anything out of a conversation with him you wouldnt choose that kind of person as a friend or marry that type ive sat down next to some of my people on the streetcar and frankly i dont relish it i guess we just consider ourselves better than others when you come down to that part of it im segregated myself there are some of em i wouldnt be caught walking the street with now i got to say itthere are some who just dont fit in with the people in washington youll find this in all races some they dont fix up like us we was both glad when the people next door moved they wasnt good neighbors were not all in the same class as one man said everyone knows there are second class negroes why i turned down stardom in paris by hermann gantt a series of suc2 cessful song recital appearances in holland last summer i accepted an invitation to spend two weeks at the villa of friends on the french riviera the evening of my return to paris i was confronted by a friend with a copy of a leading french newspaper le journal du dimanche and he called to my attention a large article regarding a search for a young negro frenchspeaking actor for a leading role in a new play by the popular french playwright marcel ayme the play supposedly dealt with racial problems in the united states the play was slated to open in exactly three weeks and the article gave every indication that the producers were desperately anxious for anyone with the abovementioned qualifications to apply for an audition my friend who is a french businessman and knows very little about show business assumed that since i had enjoyed some measure of success as a serious singer i should be able to act too after he had paid me that obviously kind compliment i gave out with a hearty chuckle and replied while ive had some dramatic training i do not profess to be an actor my dramatic studies were pursued only to enhance my stage presence and perhaps familiarize me with the stage in case of any operatic opportunities he continued to insist that i should audition for the part and as a means of terminating the subject as quickly as possible i jokingly agreed to do the audition if he would make all the necessary arrangements thinking he had received the message that i couldnt have been more disinterested i promptly began to tell him about the glorious vacation i had spent on the breathtakingly beautiful riviera i was so very wrong because he actually took me seriously and arranged for an audition after which he sent me an express note saying he had taken heed of my advice and had made all the arrangements i was positively flabbergasted to put it mildly realizing his genuine sincerity i knew i could not and would not fail to appear for that audition accompanied by him and another friend who was vacationing in paris from his native denmark i appeared at the theatre de la renaissance one of the most beautiful theatres in europe at the appointed hour 46 we were greeted by the producer the director and the author himself and to my great surprise they reacted as though they had found a longlost friend i thought that extremely odd since id never before seen either of them they immediately began to look at me from head to foot and silently but very busily nodding their approval ive had many auditions but never have i been exposed to such flattery then came the question have you had any acting experience i replied that i had had little or no acting experience on the legitimate stage but i had studied drama at the new england conservatory in boston while pursuing my vocal and repertory studies there their glowing faces changed slightly and the producer said quite apologetically you do understand that the role demands an actor who also has command of the french language i replied equally embarrassed yes i do and was all prepared to offer my apologies and excuse myself at that precise moment the producer perked up a bit and said but would you read for us anyway i frankly couldnt see the logic in it but i agreed a gesture was made for me to walk through a door onto the stage and i asked for a few minutes to review and study the scene they had suggested i read for them it later turned out to be the most difficult of all a few minutes later i appeared on stage my two buddies standing proudly in the wings and began to read the scene with a very charming young lady who later turned out to be magali noel a popular film actress in france germany and italy i later apologized for not having recognized her nor her famous name i remember having so much enjoyed her work in rififi another equally talented actress marpessa dawn dashed over to give me a mostassuring handshake and a warm smile no one could ever forget her in black orpheus my reading of the part went miserably enough and again i was quite prepared for the legendary thankyou dontcallus well callyou bit again i was so wrong and how wrong i was they not only offered me the part but asked me to sign the contract right then and there i conceded that this was just too good to be true hence i asked for a 24 hour thinkitover period quite reluctantly they agreed i returned to the theatre the next day at the exact hour and gave them my decisionyes everyone concerned seemed happy and excited including me who couldnt have been more disinterested at the outset of this whole experience the happiness and excitement unknowingly was to be reversed later i commenced intensive study of the text and discovered that the role of david a southern american negro graduate law student was indeed an interesting one from many points of view the first being i was tremendously impressed that someone had had the courage to write a part of great dignity and intelligence for a negro actor especially in a play dealing with racial problems in the u s i felt that i was obliged to become an actor in three short weeks in order to play such a choice rolethinking that if i did a reasonably acceptable job it would perhaps inspire other writers to follow the trend of marcel ayme after eleven days of really gruelling study of the text and character i emerged having learned and memorized some 250 lines that would stagger the most seasoned actorto say nothing of learning it in the french language marcel aymes style is considered to be fiendishly difficult even for the french i felt proud to have worked so well and felt at this point i was ready to begin staging the part with the director andre villiers that is where the trouble started monsieur villiers gave me a brief rundown on the stage business in my big scenes with mile noel i had a general idea of what he wanted so i did not press him for minute details as i was sure he would bring all those to my attention as the rehearsals progressed i was happier than i can remember because i suppose of the tremendous challenge it proposed it was during the more detailed points of interpretation that monsieur villiers and i began to see things quite differently he insisted that i portray the role of david in a stereotype uncle tom manner and of course i was not only shocked but thoroughly embarrassed at first i thought i had not understood him correctly i had my fellow players showed equal shock and embarrassment that he should distort the original conception of the part thereby robbing it of the personal dignity pride and intelligence of anyone who possessed a masters degree in law as had david i knew full well i had not misunderstood the text nor the original intentions of the author and i stood my ground but firmly i tried to reason with him and even told him that no negro student in america today would act like thaton the contrary i went so far as to ask if he read the newspapers if he had he would know that it is the students that have brought about equality for negroes in america he wouldnt hear me out and stubbornly stood by his guns after innumerable disputes i finally walked out of rehearsal just four days before opening night immediately i went to every newspaper in paris including the associated press and told my story the next morning it certainly was the scandale de paris the first newspaper i went to i was promptly given the runaround and was told by three different people that there was no one there to talk to me i accepted this untruth 43 and made my way to the ap office in paris and was interviewed by a very kind gentleman named mcnulty who hails from california only after the ap called to verify my abdication of the role did the other papers give me an interview many people mostly french have said to me that it must have taken great courage for me to give up my first starring role in what appeared at first to be an important play i personally do not consider it courage at all but rather my way of aiding the cause of black peoples everywhere many of whom have given their lives and my contribution is nothing by comparison the play was finally reviewed on sept 21st after an african young man replaced me and they agreed with me to the man that it was the most oldfashioned boring and insulting play to be presented to the french public about life in the southern united states the critics even went on to reprimand the author for having the audacity to set himself up as an authority on a subject about which he knows so little alongside tennessee williams and william faulkner the critics recalled that its the second time that marcel ayme has attacked the u s in that he wrote la mouche bleue the blue fly a few seasons back which only lasted three days i feel very sure that his last similar effort louisiane will meet the same fate elegy to charles laury

days americas literary critics will stumble on the fact that there is indeed something rancid in the soul of the south as it is now they tend to concede only that professional southerners are preoccupied with the wrongs and sufferings they endured at the hands of the reconstructionists a hundred years ago and that these tragic victims have legitimate gripes the critics look no further and no deeper just possibly because to do so would involve them in an allpervading moral mess from which they now superiorly disassociate themselves instead of meeting headon what stares them in the face

prodigious research by dillon a professor of history at texas technological college recreates the whole climate of politics and depravity that affected the question of slavery in the decades immediately preceding the civil war by frank london brown wendolyn brooks has a quiet face when she smiles her eyes seem to be laughing at something which only she understands it is as though she were amused by some aspect of a joke which we have missed as though she were including the whole world in the joke it is difficult to see gwendolyn brooks the pulitzer prize winning poet when you are looking at gwendolyn brooks the woman she is cryptic in her lack of pretension baffling in her perfect role as just a chicago housewife not long ago a newspaper man from sweden called her up explaining that he was an ardent admirer of her poetry and that he would like very much to interview her before he left the city three other men were there when he arrived all of them novelists the men began talking about the philosophical trends in contemporary literature about race relations thruout the world and similarly weighty topics gwendolyn brooks spent the entire evening serving coffee tea and cookies and emptying ash trays it was nearly morning when the newsman realized that he hadnt heard a squeak out of gwendolyn at his request she read one of her poems then exhausted by the long evening he tottered back to his hotel still wondering what gwendolyn brooks is really like only the shelves of books in her tiny gray walled living room give her away only her work exposes her as the consummate artist she is her poems and stories are about people she can make a poem about a 47th street hepcat ring so true that cold shivers run up your spine she can write of an abor54 tion or a childs coming home from school in a way that is almost ethereal yet as stunning as a quick left jab her style reminds you of virginia woolf at her best but when you think of the complexity of ideas in her work you must think of william faulkner and when you consider her force and photographic clarity you must recall thomas wolfe because she generates so much electricity in her writing it is all the more ironic that on that may night in 1950 when a newspaper reporter telephoned her and asked do you know youve won the pulitzer prize gwendolyn brooks was literally in the dark the power company had cut off her lights until she could scrape together enough money to pay her bill she received the news with a scream then she took her little boy to the movies even on the threshold of fame she could not act the part of the laureled poetess in annie allen the book which had earned her the prize she mused and if the sun comes how shall we greet him shall we not dread him after so lengthy a session in the shade her years in the shade were not always happy but they were productive for gwendolyn has been writing as long as she can remember as early as age 7 she was embroiled in a literary dispute her school teacher finding her handwriting hard to take it is still hieroglyphic today gave her an f on a composition gwendolyns mother angered by the womans obvious lack of perception informed the teacher that gwendolyn was probably a better writer than the teacher and read the composition on the spot the teacher agreed and changed the grade later critics have not needed to be intimidatedtheir praise has been continuous and loud paul engle of the university of iowa calls her work the best poetry that is being written in chicago these days rolfe humphries reviewing her poems in the nation said her strength consists of boldness invention a daring to experiment a naturalness that does not scorn literature but absorbs it exploits it the famous negro poet claude mckay wrote a poem to her and richard wright the late pioneering novelist proclaimed her technique and fire when gwendolyn was 13 her technique may have been shaky but the fire was already smoldering she was editor publisher and circulation manager of the champlain weekly probably the only newspaper in history which was handwritten and delivered by its publisher and she had a marvelous source of newsher mother as the ladies in the neighborhood poured out their souls to mrs brooks she in turn poured their stories into gwendolyns eager ears and gwendolyn poured them into the pages of her little newspaper two things combined to sabotage gwendolyns early publishing career the collective fury of outraged housewives and competition from the chicago tribune which was selling for 2 cents a copy while production costs forced her to sell her news for a nickel in 1936 gwendolyn then 19 received a two year certificate from wilson junior college that ended her school days she wanted a degree but hard times dictated a paying job and she found herself working in an unusual office opening letters laying aside the coins and bills that fell out of them and answering them the answers were brief my dear mrs jones i am sure your husband still loves you you must have faith and continue using the love potion thank you for your order the office was a kind of church gwendolyn remembers and it was in the mecca building that used to be at 33d and state the rev the man who ran the office received tons of mail from people who wanted holy thunderbolts love charms and magic potions we made the charms and brewed the potions ourselves i got 8 a week and i hated it when the reverend offered to make me assistant pastor i quit the experience was not wasted though she is completing a new novel based on her recollections of the mecca building at 22 gwendolyn met her man henry blakely wrote poetry and the attraction was mutual and instantaneous they were married a month later reading books all night writing together in silence in the same room reading their work to each other going to writers workshopsit was gwendolyns dream turned real but real too was their need for money too real were the dreary one room kitchenette apartments they lived in over the stores near the l track it was in these days and these places that gwendolyn wrote one of the best known poems of her first collection a street in bronzeville it was entitled simply kitchenette building we are things or gray hours and the involuntary plan grayed in and gray dream makes a giddy sound not strong like rent feeding a wife satisfying a man but could a dream send up thru onion fumes its white and violet fight with fried potatoes and yesterdays garbage ripening 56 in the hall flutter or sing an aria down these rooms gwendolyn brooks was living the life she wrote about the tears in her poems were her own as her words slipped into print the honors came and the prizes twice she was winner of the poetry workshop award twice she received the guggenheim fellowship for creative writing the american academy of arts and letters and the national institute of arts and letters both gave her grants and in 1945 mademoiselle magazine named her one of americas 10 women of the year in 1949 she returned these favors by producing her masterpiece of collected poems annie allen today gwendolyn and her husband an as yet unpublished novelist who earns the familys livelihood as an insurance adjuster live with their 10 year old daughter nora in a small one story frame house on chicagos south side their son henry jr is in the marines she is just a little more subdued than in earlier days altho she no longer belongs to a civil_rights organization she met her husband at an naacp youth council meeting in her latest book of poetry the bean eaters she utters one of the most piercing outcries against the murder of chicagoan emmett till that has ever appeared in print she is familiar now with the hollow land of fame but she has never lost sight of the rainbow love is the rainbow she chases love in the broadest sense love of each man and woman by each man and woman she wants to show her readers the golden cord of humanity that unites every girl in a tattered dress and every girl in a gown of silk she declares it in her precise but passionate poetry and in the jazzlike experiments of her one short novel maude martha she is saying that birth happiness sorrow and toil are much more extraordinary than they usually seem to us she is saying that lifes real magic lies in these things alone and that we are still strangers to the reality which we have abandoned in our search for some vague higher truth in her childrens book bronzeville boys and girls she puts the essential question of our existence so gently

they egation blocks their nomic opportunities tand they have an injegro market since it rtain limited opporgroowned business e almost always exthe white market it becomes a matter of vast importance to properly cultivate the negro market with few exceptions therefore negroowned business is dependent upon the negro market historically the negro operated in the field of general business before the emancipation proclamation a negro slave lunsford lane of raleigh north carolina purchased his freedom from the sale of a superior smoking tobacco which he and his father manufactured thorny lafon a free negro in new orleans operated a drygoods store from which he branched out into the moneylending business to accumulate an estate of 413000 at his death in 1893 stephen smith and william whipper were successful lumber and oyster merchants in philadelphia they owned and operated one of the largest coal yards in the city of brotherly love it was reported in 1849 that the firm held 250000 feet of lumber 22 merchantmen cars running between baltimore and philadelphia and 9000 worth of stock in the columbia bridge their notes were accepted anywhere for any amount smith donated 150000 in 1864 for the establishment of a home for aged and infirmed colored people other examples of successful negro businessmen in the 18th and 19th centuries can be found in many books and papers dealing with this subject caterers carriage makers newspaper publishers shopkeepers and other negro businessmen were operating in boston washington charleston philadelphia and savannah during this period during and after world war i the continuous fluid migration of negroes to centralcity areas from rural areas created a new demand for services never before witnessed in the nation barber shops beauty parlors restaurants funeral parlors candy stores bootblack parlors small grocery stores and novelty shops spring up like mushrooms in new york atlanta detroit chicago st louis cleveland washington philadelphia and other cities whose negro populations were growing by leaps and bounds 60 to say the least the success of many of these businesses was shortlived negroowned businesses are usually hampered by lack of capital credit restrictions lack of trained personnel and by a lack of sound methods of simple business principles these are the surefire catalytic agents which foredoom them to failure gunnar myrdal reports in an american dilemma in 1939 there were not quite 30000 negroowned retail stores including eating and drinking places giving employment to an almost equal number of proprietors and less than 14000 hired employees orapart from 1000 unpaid family members a total of 43000 persons thus negro retail trade in terms of employment is not totally insignificant compared with the size of white retail trade however it is negligible the total sales in 1939 were 71000000 which was less than twotenths of one per cent of the national total myrdal further states there were no signs of improvement in the relative position of negro retail trade the proportion of negroes among all retail dealers was if anything smaller in 1930 than in 1910 the same trend downward is visible during the period of 19291939 a more recent report shows that the major negroowned financial institutions which include 51 life insurance companies 21 savings and loan companies and 11 banks have total assets of a little over a halfbillion dollars when compared with the 478 billion dollar assets of whiteowned financial institutions in the same category the assets of 83 negroowned top financial institutions pale into almost total insignificance i briefly cite this current report to show that myrdals findings in 1939 prove that practically all negroowned businesses are retrogressing year by year when measured with comparable whiteowned businesses all is not on the red side of the ledger however great strides have been made by astute and resourceful negro businessmen and negroowned business institutions the story of h b fuller and his integrated cosmetic empire fulfills the american dream of a land of opportunity his story has graced the pages of fortune and ebony

speaking of africa our federal government is making tremendous strides in cooperating with the new independent african nations in trade and industrial development as negro businessmen with a vested interest in america we should make every possible financial effort to profitably aid in the development of these nations after all who can be a better salesman of democracy in africa than a negro businessman with some worthwhile product or service to contribute i do not intend to imply that negro businessmen should become missionaries in africa they should seek to establish bona fide business relations and in so doing will bring to the african nations those products and services which they sorely need many other successful cases of enterprising negro businessmen can be cited all over the world the examples pointed out prove that negroowned business can succeed in practically every type of industry in the total economy the disturbing problem of negroowned business however is its inability to keep pace with other business enterprises in the total economy as previously stated when negroowned businesses are matched with the same types of whiteowned businesses they pale by comparison into almost total insignificance following are major steps which must be taken by negroowned business to assure growth expansion competence and even survival in our everchanging economy 1 develop a sound research program which is so necessary in planning for the present as well as for the future 2 relegate the function of marketing which includes advertising sales sales promotion and public relations to the policymaking level 3 prepare sales campaigns with imagination and enthusiasm and with welldefined incentives for salesmen 4 develop topflight continuous training programs for all personnel 5 develop an image of goodwill and respect for your business by planning an effective public relations program 6 seek out and develop new investment possibilities in reference to financial institutions such opportunities as housing developments savings and loan associations the granting of loans to competent young negroes with sound ideas and other imaginative investment potentials are available 7 seek new profits by mergers acquisitions and diversification into mutually profitable related businesses 8 avoid the employment of relatives and close friends when their lack of competence acts as a detriment to the effective operation of the business 9 create new ways of adding to the longrange value of products by offering new services and developing new attitudes toward the increasingly sophisticated consumer 10 eliminate the concept of negro business and operate in the sphere of negrocontrolled business serving the community with competence by meeting competitive prices and standards a short story by joe gores d brandeis editor of the holyoke weekly courier drove north it was good to be getting away for a couple of weeks holyoke had never had a lynching before and in mississippi that was a pretty good record he looked to his right to the broad slow sprawl of water the greenclad bluffs with naked rock showing through southerners were like the river placid on top and slowly seething underneath up here in minnesota folks werent like that in the deepening dusk the tires whined hypnotically the lynching had been inevitable of course wilson should have left the white woman alone during the sheriffs token trial for complicity eds editorials had scored the northern meddlers deeply on that point wilson had deserved lynching he had argued besides what could the sheriff have done the power of a mob is awesome state militia a man doesnt call in armed strangers against his friends and neighbors the sheriff had been acquitted and the couriers circulation had soared ed had been on the side of the right still it somehow bothered him he was glad to just get alone and think a couple of miles beyond one of the sleepy river hamlets that dot the mississippi ed stopped for a hitchhiker he was a short heavyset youth with closecropped black hair and tight levis and an orange windbreaker thanks for the lift mister he grinned crawling in beside ed im just going to the next town tonight thatll be swell the boy yawned and stretched spreading his arms wide across the back of the seat he had a broad neck and his dark eyes were hypnotically intense in a conversational tone he said theres a dirt road up here to the right use it what use it pops the boy shouted ramming something hard and cold and round against the back of eds neck or ill spread your brains all over the windshield i really will ed wrenched the heavy battered buick into the side road he recognized incipient hysteria in the voice pull in on the other side of that big oak and stop ed slowed the car swung obediently in behind the spreading hardwood tree the lights glared back from waxy foliage okay pops open your door slow keep both hands in sight knew a fellow once kept an automatic strapped between the seat and the door on the drivers side thats fine now step free of the door good just like an old pro ed thought grimly when this is over sonny getting struck on the back of the head is not painful it is merely a cessation of consciousness he didnt even feel his teeth bite at the ground but waking up is painful ed moved his head and knew momentary agony he groaned he rolled over and sat up slowly as if he had a glass neck there was no blood the kid had used the flat of the barrel his wallet was gone of course he walked back toward the town no cars passed him twice he rested in the weedchoked ditch finally he came to a drivein root beer stand but it was closed funny then he passed a roadside cafe closed too maybe they were mennonites or something a street angled off the highway flanked by a small park with a war memorial in the center and coollooking grass under the hardwoods coming toward him in the early dusk was a boy with a loaf of bread under his arm wheres the sheriffs office in this town asked ed the boy went into a halfcrouch holding his loaf of bread like a club with his fingers sunk deeply into the garish waxedpaper wrapper you you get away he shrieked then he dropped the bread and took off across the street like a scalded cat ed shook his head a nut at the next intersection was a barbers candystriped pole and a water fountain with a mongrel snuffling around in front of it could have been holyoke except for the deserted streets stooping for water at the fountain ed saw his refection in the barbers windows maybe it wasnt so strange the kid had run a big dark paunchy man unshaven eyes abnormally bright shirt ripped trousers muddied on the corner was a twostory red brick building that could have been the jail a little girl about five leading a puppy by a string tied to its miniature red leather collar trotted out of the alley behind the building the puppys tiny tan ears flopped almost under its feet at each step hi there honey ed squatted down on the sidewalk the girl had stopped and was staring at him she had long brown ringlets her puppy wagging all over with unquenchable puppy friendliness made a puddle on the sidewalk his name is andy said the girl solemnly mommy told me not to talk to strangers im no stranger honey my name is ed and im trying to find the sheriff can

tailored suit had rounded the corner in front of the brick building run quick to mommy as the girl fled ed heard the clatter of running feet from the alley thank god a cop officer the policeman hit him right in the middle exactly like a lineman hitting a quarterback who is about to throw eds right elbow struck the sidewalk sickeningly he tried to push the frenzied man away but the woman kicked him in the neck from behind strong hands jerked him up with momentary strength he lashed out and the policeman fell away bruised mouth gaping ed caught the glint of a fivepointed star pinned to the khaki shirt of the man behind him he had found the sheriff for the second time that evening something struck him crushingly across the back of the head out out cold got him huh thats right mr kraley right in front of the jail ed opened his eyes he was slumped in a straightback chair in the center of a bare windowless room with his hands shackled behind his back the man who belonged to the voice was talking on a wall phone beside the door he was a potbellied policeman with a badlybruised jaw ya he said into the phone the sheriffs daughter her ma stopped in here to ask walt if hed be home at

unmoved thats for cindy he said somehow ed got his feet under him his clothes reeked of the mess he had made there was no fight whatsoever in him he no longer wondered why wilson had not resisted the

supposed to have done a door slammed heavily and a huge man wearing dark trousers and a wilted white shirt with his tie pulled askew burst into the room his sleeves were rolled up over enormously hairy arms and he smelled strongly of stale sweat he had a cruellyhooked nose and his mouth was a trap is this the bastard one big arm tried to sweep labresch out of the way labresch wouldnt sweep let me at him walt ill fix his water you arent fixing anything alderman youre on the town council you know violence doesnt solve anything who told you wed picked anyone up clarence called as quick as you

god the troopers are coming what about tear gas there aint any labresch raised his voice clarence hey clarence get in here ed had been aware of a mutter of sound from the street outside it was already swelling in volume he could see through the door and across the outside office against the panes of the street windows was an uneasy smoky flickering he knew only too well torches clarence where in the hell the upper panes of one of the windows shattered inward and a brick thudded on the floor clarence shouted labresch again douse every light in the place some damn fools sure to have a gun another brick smashed through a window and then as if cued by his voice a shot rang out and a slug whined into the wall labresch ran into the next room and the lights went out abruptly there was a cheer from outside ed followed him to the door clarence bugged out said labresch he was crouched behind the desk dialling the phone into it he said this is labresch again listen where areyou mean clarence didnt call you at all dammit get some men over here right away ive got a mob on my hands and ten minutes that long well all i can do is try to hold them he hung up and looked at ed im going out to reason with them stay down dont try anything cute theyre all around the building if you go out theyll pick you to pieces ed nodded to show he understood there was little he could do with his hands shackled labresch unlocked the front door and stepped out the crowd fell momentarily silent and the torches steadied okay folks the funs over go homeall of you a voice called give him to us walt youre breaking the law especially the man who fired that shot ill overlook that because i know how you feel but state troopers will be here soon and theyll arrest any man they find on the streets with his erect body and hard eyes labresch was the type of man before whom a mob instinctively hesitates and the threat of troopers had considerably sobered them for the first time ed wondered what would have happened in holyoke if the militia had been called then kraley shouted you got three minutes to hand him out walt well hurt you if you dont and then well get him anyway labresch stepped back inside and shot the bolt as he passed the desk he scooped up a sawedoff shotgun and began ramming shells into it a shower of bricks and stones was rattling against the front of the building like monstrous hail the flickering torches danced vast menacing shadows on the walls through the glassless windows kraley had tipped them over the edge they wanted blood now they wanted the blood of ed brandeis ed was scared it was so damned unfair he deserved a chance to be heard two minutes walt kraleys voice was almost lost in the bedlam from the desk labresch said without humor someones been watching tv again the phone lines been cut fascinated ed stared at the big clock across the room ticking off the seconds of his life from the street kraleys voice shouted the death of another minute labresch checked the shotgun again and started for the front door for gods sake said ed hoarsely im not the one they want youve got to believe me im an innocent man in his mind wilson grinned in bony delight i dont believe you but what the hell difference would it make if you were innocent you mean youyou arent giving me to them i dont believe in many things mister but i believe in the law same as another man believes in his religion these people elected me to enforce the law and dammit thats what i got to do he already was going out the door when kraley shouted with a voice that shook the torches times up walt the sheriff ducked out and slammed the thick oak door behind him the mobs forward surge faltered under the menace of his shotgun labreschs grimlydetermined face stood out starkly in the torch light high cheekbones and glittering eyes accenting his probable frenchindian blood this mans in legal custody and anyone who there was a single flat unechoing report the slug knocked him back against the heavy door and dropped him to his knees kraley waved his arm like a squad leader starting into combat but he only made two paces i said hes in legal custody stand right there kraley labreschs voice was weaker more dangerous because it was thinned to the breaking point the dark stain was spreading rapidly across his shirt come on kraley shouted no one moved labreschs unwavering shotgun seemed to point at every mans navel several stragglers stealthily backed away then the man next to kraley threw down his torch at the same instant the thin wail of sirens came from the highway dark shapes suddenly broke and exploded in all directions like flushed quail kraley hesitated staring about him numbly then he threw away his torch and lumbered for the shadows labresch fell forward heavily on his face his shotgun struck the cement steps and clattered down discharging both barrels the shot ripped large patches from the deserted blacktop i wish hed known said ed brandeis sitting on a corner of the sheriffs desk he sipped cold coffee glass crunched when he shifted his foot i wish hed found out that i wasnt the one the state trooper wore a very natty twotone blue uniform and was young with straight blond hair cut short and the sort of physique that a uniform flatters so what if hed known hed have been just as dead it might have made a difference said ed stubbornly if that crazy kid had cracked up your car an hour sooner that would have made a difference or if that clarence had phoned us when he was supposed to the erect handsome chestnuthaired woman came out of the smaller room where labreschs body had been laid out on a cot her eyes were red but her voice was quite steady why did he have to do it mr brandeis he had everything to live for and and ed licked his lips he was suddenly very glad that they didnt know about wilson he was wearing a badge mrs labresch he said heavily i want him back i want him back so very much she passed a hand across her eyes even though you werent the man they wanted i wish walt had let them take you im sorry but its true staring at her uncomprehending grief ed surprised himself by saying i wish he had too then he turned abruptly away id like to get some sleep now sure mr brandeis said the trooper you can give us your deposition later im sorry about your car i dont give a damn about that ed stopped at the head of the stairs beneath his feet was the freshlyscrubbed place where walt labresch had bled there were tiny scars on the cement where the shotgun had clattered down funny he had left holyoke to get away from it but its never that easy he descended to the deserted shadowy street the air was fresh and wild with the mississippi river smell that no man could ever change as he walked aimlessly down the sidewalk in the mornings cool pale dawning ed brandeis wondered if he would ever lose his secret feeling of shame the lover my husband remembered that he too had chewed tar as a boy it was good for the teeth too charles went on to say it made the teeth real white i liked the taste too in fact i used to swallow the juice my husband placed his bare white arm alongside charles deeper colored one and in a mockserious tone said well now that accounts for the difference in our colors you swallowed more juice than i did we all had a good laugh about this and forgot it taking the conversation into other channels but my eightyearold daughter it developed took the whole thing very seriously the next day my little girl and her friend came in from play with black stains over their hands and beneath their fingernails the expressions on their faces reflected profound disappointment somewhat concerned i asked my daughter what was wrong we tried it mom she explained looking sadly up at me we ate the tar and it didnt even work we the adults were amused but our hearts were touched by our little tar babies who saw so much love in our friend that they wanted to be like him this kind of love imagines no color barrier but reaches out in response to that which is real within everyone christs love reaching out through each of us is the answer by doris e saunders t was monday the 25th of february in 1895 and at the douglass es tate in anacostia d c the great statesman was to leave his beloved cedar hill for the last time only five days before he had left his home going down the snowcovered path to the big open meeting of the national council of women in washington where he had greeted his old friend susan b anthony returning to cedar hill from that meeting in good spirits the aged warrior recounted the events of the meeting to his wife helen pitts douglass had been an ardent feminist even before she married frederick so that it was natural that she would be interested in the progress of the womens suffrage movement her husband said that the womens suffrage movement was in many respects a continuation of the antislavery movement and that the freedom of women was but an extension of the freedom of the negro a forerunner to the complete emancipation of all people during the recounting of mrs anthonys comments helen douglass noticed that her husband seemed a little tired and then he fell moments later he was dead the career that had begun in a slave cabin on the eastern shore of maryland was ended the name of frederick douglass of course was known throughout the length and breadth of this country as well as abroad he never knew exactly when he was born but he assumed from other events that it was sometime in february 1817 about 1841 he escaped from his master and shortly after began to lecture on the evils of slavery under the auspices of the massachusetts antislavery society his eloquence was such that he soon became widely known as an oratora man of true and moving power his autobiography published in 1845 so enraged slaveholders that even in a free state he was in danger so that he fled to england where he continued lecturing in the cause of abolition kind english friends collected money and purchased his freedom thus enabling him to return in safety to the us where with backing from his english benefactors he founded the north star the antislavery paper he had dreamed of editing the paper was issued weekly from rochester n y until slavery was abolished a friend of william lloyd garrison and of john brown douglass continued to grow in power and influence when the civil war began president lincoln sought his advice in the use of negroes as soldiers and after that douglass helped to enlist men in the 54th massachusetts regiment the first regiment of negro soldiers from the north after the war he moved to washington and for several years edited the new national era another weekly newspaper later he served the us government as marshal recorder of deeds for the district and finally as minister to haiti he continued to work on his autobiography and each new edition brought it further along the final publication is titled the life and times of frederick douglass even in his final years he was erect carrying his massive white bearded head on broad shoulders with vigor and great dignity now frederick douglass slave orator editor abolitionist marshal of the district of columbia commissioner to santo domingo and minister to haiti president of the freedmens bank and one of the greatest americans of any agelay in the parlor of cedar hill in a large oaken casket serenely at rest cedar hill the 14acre douglass estate sits proudly on the crest of a hill overlooking washington and the potomac river the 20room white colonialstyle brick and stucco house is surrounded by the lofty oaks and cedars which give it its name and this last morning a fresh snow had covered the already fallen snow to give to douglass beloved home and grounds a new mantle for his departure the rev hugh stevenson of the local anacostia baptist church had come up the hill to conduct a private funeral service for the family before the body was removed to metropolitan ame church in washington the widow came into the dim parlor and took a seat in the small circle of chairs that had been arranged in a semioval facing the casket a small woman she seemed to have contained her emotions behind a stoic new england calm only the bloodless knuckles of her hands which she clasped tightly together indicated the stress she had undergone in the days since her husband fell dead at her feet douglass son lewis and her two daughters estella and hattie sprague and charles son joseph now joined mrs douglass in the semicircle it had been no secret that this second white wife of frederick douglass had never been accepted by the douglass children and grandchildren however there had never been any question in douglass mind that he had done the right thing in marrying helen from the beginning when his old friend francis j grimke had protested that such a marriage was suicide douglass had not wavered i should be false to all the purposes and principles of my life if i did not marry this noble lady who has done me the honor to consent to be my wife he replied i am a free man i am free even of making appearances just to impress would it not be ridiculous if after having denounced from the housetops all those who discriminate because of the accident of skin color i myself should practice the same folly 76 but antipathies were for the occasion ignored and now the family kneeled together in prayer for the man they all loved deeply the brief prayer over the family listened in silence as reverend stevenson read from the scriptures then the great casket was closed the bitter cold of the past week had abated somewhat and a light snow still fell as the casket was removed to be taken into washington to the metropolitan ame church for the services to be held later in the day the family retired behind the solid doors of cedar hill thus began the day on which frederick douglass funeral was held in washington d c the damp and penetrating cold did not deter the unhappy throngs that milled through the streets around the funeral site the metropolitan ame church had been selected for the services primarily for its ability to cope with the hundreds of persons expected to attend the services douglass detachment to organized religion had caused him to be accused of atheism and he was constantly contrasting the behavior of socalled christians who did not practice the brotherhood and charitable love they preached with free thinkers such as garrison and ingersoll he often said how unfortunate it was for many pious souls hate the negro while they think they love the lord wisely the reverend j t jenifer minister of metropolitan understood that douglass was in spirit a free religionist who trusted in a divine providence and had no uneasiness about his personal relationship with god jenifer was happy that metropolitan had been selected for the funeral though frederick douglass was not a member of any church by ten oclock that morning the street outside the church was clogged with carriages and people as the time for th services approached the crowd increased to such proportions that passage was almost impossible those who were fortunate enough to have the small white cards of invitation were admitted to the church early the general public was not admitted until after the beginning of the services palms and ferns were banked about the main altar where the casket was placed the great figure leonine even in death was surrounded by floral offerings from heads of state politicians and friends from around the world on the casket a simple spray of lilies from helen since the evening in january 1884 when helen pitts 46yearold white spinster had become mrs frederick douglass their love mutual interest and understanding had forged a bridge that covered the difference in their years as well as their race at that time helen had said love came to me and i was not afraid to marry the man i loved because of his color now widowed she had those years of happi ness and fulfillment to sustain her she would have preferred a simple service but she realized that frederick belonged to the people whom he had spent his life in serving so she kept silent it was nearly two oclock in the afternoon before the funeral procession filed into the church first the family followed by the honorary pallbearers former u s senator blanche k bruce he and his wife stood up with helen and frederick when they were married w h wormley john r lynch john e cook exgov of louisiana p b s pinchback john r francis f g barbadoes d l pitcher john h brooks dr c b purvis former head of freedmens hospital the son of abolitionist robert purvis who with douglass had been one of the prime movers in the american antislavery society and congressman george w murray among the notables in attendance were justice john marshall harlan the famous dissenter in the civil_rights cases of 1893 and the later plessy v ferguson harlans dissenting opinions are still cited by lawyers and laymen who reject the validity of these decisions senators sherman and hoars and a number of members of the house of representatives judge and mrs robert mary church terrell susan b anthony a large delegation from the womens council and dr daniel hale williams the new head of freedmens hospital and a distant kinsman of the great fallen leader finally all were seated and the services began the choir started softly with nearer my god to thee followed by a prayer for the soul of the deceased by the rev fr alexander crummell of st lukes episcopal church the choir now in full voice sang in thy cleft o rock of ages then bishop alexander wayman a pioneer in the african methodist movement in the south and a contemporary of douglass from the eastern shore of maryland read the nineteenth psalm his full and rich voice hung in the air as the last words of the psalm were uttered let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in they sight o lord my strength and my redeemer now reverend jenifer began the delivery of the funeral sermon douglass beliefs were too well known to be ignored so reverend jenifer stated flatly frederick douglass was a christian he broke with the american church and with the american christian dogma when he saw that it sanctioned and sustained the enslavement and the bondage of a brother he held christ to be above creed and above the church this explained he then continued with the traditional eulogy following jenifers sermon reverend stevenson of the anacostia baptist church and dr j e ran78 kin president of howard university read tributes to the dead the remarks of the haitian minister to the united states were interpreted by the former u s minister to haiti j l durham then the aging susan b anthony spoke of douglass and his labors in behalf of the negro vote and his championing of womens rights then john hutchinson of boston now extremely aged with snowy beard and long white hair reaching down to his shoulders recalled the days when the hutchinson family the minnesingers of american freedom accompanied frederick in the tours of new england seeking converts to the doctrine of abolition then in his frail voice he sang the abolition song that his brother jesse had dedicated to douglass years before ill be free ill be free and none shall confine with fetters and chains this spirit of mine from my youth i have vowed in god to rely and despite the oppressor gain freedom or die when his voice was still even the most composed and reconciled eyes were moist now the benediction was pronounced by bishop williams of the colored methodist episcopal church in south carolina by now it was after five oclock and the winter sky had darkened instead of diminishing the crowd had grown so that it was nearly impossible for the funeral procession to make its way to the waiting carriages the negro letter carriers of the district escorted the body to the depot where it was placed on the 710 train for rochester n y reaching there the following morning helen lewis charles rosetta and the three grandchildren accompanied the body the family truce lasted throughout the period of the funeral rochester was in mourning it was nearly 10 oclock before the cortege of the former distinguished resident of rochester left the depot for the city hall this was helens home as well as fredericks but she had never lived with him here as his wife it was anna who had been the wife of frederick douglass in rochester and the house on alexander street had been his underground railway station headquarters douglass had been proud that no united states marshal had ever taken a fugitive slave from rochester so to rochester he returned accompanying the body to the city hall where it lay in state for several hours were the mayor members of the common council and other city officials and the honorary pall bearers the douglass league of rochester moving from the city hall to the central presbyterian church the hearse wound through endless lines of silent spectators following the invocation by r h h stebbins and the eulogies a male quartet sang hail thou me helen recalled that douglass had hummed the tune the day before he died then the organist played swing low sweet chariot and as the funeral cortege made its way from the church the ninth symphony of beethoven filled the building helen had the last word with this sound in their ears the mourners made their slow way to mount hope cemetery here frederick douglass was laid to rest why i became an actor by sidney poitier interviewer what made you decide to be an actor poitier what made me decide to be an actor well i decided to become an actor because i had tried a great many other things i had no skilled trade so the things i tried all were of aworkingwithyourhands style and it bored me quickly all of it i was a ditch digger a dish washer a car washer a porterand these are for me very boring activities always have been one day i found in a newspaper a negro newspaper specifically the amsterdam news the new york amsterdam news on the advertisement page an ad saying actors wanted and i figured having tried everything else you knowand i was quite young i figured what the hell ill give this a go i went ahead and i told them i was an actor and they said read something for us well i read very poorly they threw me out promptly my pride was hurt terribly hurt i had never been rejected so so forcefully before and i said to myself well dammit ill show them ill read good for them so i set out on a sixmonth campaign of trying to orientate my speech of trying to gather a kind of onedimensional understanding of the theatre and gather certain catch phrases theatre phrases such as whatever you use if you are an inperson in the theatre and i went back and thats how i became an actor interviewer why is it that acting had appealed to you at all had you been to plays poitier no i had not been to plays i thought that actors made good money and i wanted to make money and i also wanted to do something other than manual labor you see i was illequipped to do anything else but manual labor i thought here is a field that probably i could take hold in you know if im lucky rather than having to expose myself to five or six years of training in a school for a special craft or trade for which i didnt have the money or the time i figured i would have a go at this also i was footloose and fancyfree i was moving about in the world you know i had no great responsibilities i was young and i had thei had the freedom and the prerogative to walk off a job as a porter if i didnt like it or it bored me to tears i was a great daydreamer i would wind up leaving the job and going and sitting near the water or in central park and just dream all day interviewer about what poitier oh about things people and mostly about i think our dreams are usually made of the yearnings and needs unfulfilled you know so we go about trying to fulfill them interviewer i understand that you bought a radio and for six months you studied the diction of people you heard on it poitier i studied the diction of people on the radio because my speech was obviously west indian and not as clear or as cultivated as one needs to have it for theatre work i couldnt go to a school as a matter of fact i didnt know there was such a thing as a school for speech so i bought magazines and i would listen to the radio and i would repeat what i heard on the radio most news broadcasts and in time my speech began to lighten in the areas where it was particularly broad interviewer i was told that when you returned for an audition you brought one of the magazines you had studied to read from poitier yes true confessions magazine and i read it i read a paragraph of it as an audition as a scene plays and all that jazzi was fairly ignorant about the theatre all i had was a passion to show see in all my life although it was only a poor one and fierce one i had always had great pride and in the caribbean a young negro is never robbed of his pride as he is in some parts of the southern united states so that at the age of fifteen sixteen i wasi was fierce crude and very alive in many many senses many important senses interviewer so the rejection at the theatre was a blow to your pride poitier yes yes the rejection was a blow and a challenge you see and one that i had to accept i was told to get out of the theatre this was the american negro theatre near 135th street intervie1 er yes i know poitier i was told to get out and forget it to go back and just get a job and you see the image of whatthe image of the rejection to me was this i saw my life every subsequent year of my life i saw it in the drudgery of manual labor i saw a limit placed on my potential had i accepted the rejection as my fate then i would have been ordained to a kind of onedimensional living circumscribed by my limitations and hung in a kind of abyss of never really being able to reach beyond my grasp interviewer what else did you do to train yourself besides the reading and the radio during that sixmonth period poitier well i did a great many things in the caribbean i had gone to school for a very brief period for a year and a half and i could barely write or read however i knew certain littlei had acquired certain little hints of reading such as the phonetic way of pronunciation and if a word puzzles you you do not know its meaning you start with the first three letters et cetera et cetera so that you in turn will be able to pronounce it fairly accurately and i began to try to improve my reading you see by sight which was very hard for me but it began to improve the reason i went to a true confessions magazine primarily is because they wereaside from the fact that i didnt know anything about bookstoresthey were always very simply written and i could understand what it was saying i was not often overwhelmed by words in its structure i studied reading and i listened to the radio for speech and i used to read newspapers a great deal i didnt always know what was in them or what the articles were all about but i did know some of the words and a constant exposure to these words helped me to develop a familiarity with them so that sight and reproduction became synonymous interviewer did you use a dictionary too poitier no i did not i had a strange way of holding words that i would pronounce but did not understand their meaningholding them in abeyance for a time when i did find a sentence with the word in it so structured that i suddenly knew what it meant interviewer how many hours a day did you spend at this radio to rid yourself of the west indian accent poitier many many hours when i was working and i worked throughout this periodi worked various places i was working in the garment district for the most part evenings and mornings and whenever i could get to a magazine or a newspaper the reading was constant because i had no time for much else i had no friends the small salary from the district or wherever i worked was such that the small room i maintained and the food and the few dollars for clothingwell that was all i could afford interviewer youve made the statement that you were an actor made exclusively by friends over the years and i was curious to know whether this was a correct statement and who were the important influences upon you poitier it is a correct statement in part i am made in terms of my success by my friends people who at one time or another did me a good turn who are the friends they are varied they come from many walks of life they are people who permitted me to use them as studies they are people who are interested in my work or interested in me or interested in helpingthey are directors and writers producers and workaday folk so this though its true in part is not a definitive statement interviewer did you study other actors did you go to the theatre to watch actors our leading actors work poitier it was only in later years that i developed a kind of interest in watching other actors work in the theatre but i watched many actors work because i was always involved in class work and group work and various theatre groups that was my life you see thats where i did most of my learning i was in and out of groups and little theatres and projects i first of all couldnt afford the legitimate theatre often but i didnt take advantage of the times when i could afford it it used to bore me broadway theatre used to bore the daylights out of me until i finally became interested in certain actors there were certain actors who were my kind of actors people with great power and i would go and watch them work interviewer did you have any formal training or are you now taking formal training poitier as an actor interviewer as an actor poitier oh yes i took many years from 1946 i took formal training which is what nowfourteen years i took formal training at the american negro theatre it was training of a kind adequate for that period totally inadequate for now in 1947 48 49 50 i was always taking formal training from various people sometimes actors sometimes from a group sometimes fromsometimes for free sometimes you pay a small fee and then i eventually wound upin the 50s i wound up with the paul mann actors workshop after having taken many many years of formal training helterskelter of course but formal training interviewer paul mann as i understand it follows the stanislavsky approach to acting poitier yes interviewer are you then one of the method actors in your work or do you amalgamate method with your own methods poitier i am not a method actor i study method and i work method before i perform to explain the stanislavsky method is intended i believeand if im wrong i use it this way neverthelessi think it is intended to be used as a method of preparation for work not as a method employable in the instance of work so i use the stanislavsky method in preparing my work something which i am privileged to use over a long period of time before i go on the stage or before i go on in front of a camera which means that instead of employing the stanislavsky method for two hours a night in a theatre i employ it for two or three months in the preparation of that work so that when i go on the stage or in front of a camera my function becames organic and instant and natural spontaneous and full because i have a frame of reference for every want every need every desire that is registered on my emotion boards interviewer could you be specific here and just take us through a single part you prepared for poitier well lets take the last thing i did on the stage lets take a raisin in the sun i received the script almost a year before we went into production right and i read it naturally many many many times and i knew generally after ten or twenty readings what the circumstances of the play were i knew what the individual characters were like generally i understood my character kind of generally now i needed time to make my understanding of my character specific in so doing i must understand all of the contributing elements that go to making up this character first i must understand what are the driving forces in the man in order to understand that you must find out what are his political social economic religious milieus and how they contribute to the personality idiosyncrasies or whatever and in so examining i find that this first is a negro man thirtysix years old living in chicago on the south sidewhich of itself is quite significant in the building of a character because only a particular kind of negro lives on the south south in this particular kind of circumstances see so that narrows the field already and then we take why is this man living here is he here by choice what is his relation to his community what is his relation to his religion if he has one what is his relation to his economic disposition is it one in which he finds enough elasticity to function and maintain his manhood or it is a constant badge or remembrance of his inadequaciesyou followand all these things can be found in the script or at least if theyre not there they can be made compatible with what is in the script at one point or another so that after months of actually making specific this man in his milieuthen i come to the final conclusion of what are his wants and when i find what are his general wants i find what is his most specific want or wants i now have the man in total i know what his reaction would be to everything done and said in the playsee i know what and how he feels about his neighborhood so that any question or reference to it strikes a certain chord in a man now with this kind of information i then proceed to familiarize myself with the pros and cons of his life and his wants i try to experience them so by the time im ready to perform i dont go in a cornerat least i dont have to go in a corner and concentrate and conjure up some mysterious magic i walk on the stage and it happens and i dont work method because its too late now to work method if youre not ready forget it you walk on the stage and you find that you have taken on the milieu of the character and you then begin to seek out and fulfill the very wants that are burning inside you now which are his wants once youre on the stage you have no time because the stage is to experienceyou followthe stage is to experience once the curtain goes up and there is an audience out there you the artist your responsibility is to experience and only through your experiencing are you able really to transmityou follow there are many kinds of actors there are actors who can get on a stage but they can never quite enthrall nor can they ever quite involve or hypnotize but they can give a workmanlike job well if theyre not gifted they dont enthrall and they dont involve because they themselves are not able to involve on the level required by the artist interviewer what is the difference between these two poitier there is a basic difference to my mind between the two and ofttimes its not because of the difference in talent its sometimesit always is the difference in the humanity of the individual you see there is a phrase used by jazz musicians and they call it soul it is a reference to a certain kind of humanityof the sensitivity of humanitythat is overstocked in one person they use the word soul because there are certain gifted brilliant musicians who have a kind of human compassion thatthey are so inarticulate in every other phase of life they can only express through their music and hence they are terribly important musicians and gifted with actors i thinkthere are actors who have not as much and there are actors who are void of it now the fine actors who are void of it are called technicians they are quite capable of making you realize you are in a theatre watching a terribly gifted technician at work and you say ahh hes marvelous if he had the added gift of soul you would forget youre in a theatre thats the difference interviewer what is it that you find you like about acting poitier that i like about acting interviewer yes but if you prefer to talk about what you dont like about acting you can do that too poitier well iyou know thats an interesting question i dont know how i can answer it interviewer what do you get from acting that satisfies you poitier thats a different question i can better answer that from acting i get a sense ofof worthwhileness i feel for instance there were times in my past when out of sheer naivete and modesty i was afraid to accept the fact that i was a gifted actor it was only in later years that i realized that the gift of an actor does not belong to him that i accepted that i am a gifted actorand cannot point to any one or group of efforts on my part that created the gift i was born with it lets be honest and lets be factual i was born with a gift i had nothing to do with it when my mother conceivedthat moment the combination of genes carried inherently whatever there was that i suddenly found at the age of seventeen or eighteen so what i get from acting is using it for others using it for people i find that when i work well people enjoy it and theythings happen to them by that i mean when i use it well they share it you see and they share it in good ways you follow and thats what ithats what i get from it interviewer you have this gift but you must do something to make yourself a better actor or a better human being or whateveror am i wrong i mean is the gift there and thats the end of it poitier no its your responsibility to nurture it its like a seed its like a plant its like a child you feed it yes you nurture it you care for it interviewer how poitier well ive tried to care for it for fourteen years first of all it is important that the actor recognize that his gift is an entity the human entityin that package so the package must be cared for not only cared for but it must be cared for in ways that become advantageous to the flowering of the gift the mind and the body are the only two tools to be cared for kept not under glass but kept in good working condition above and beyond that it must be exposed to its limits constantlyto life because it then acts as an absorption board so that when the gift has to be placed in motion you are not trying to click it over a void you need to call on experiences when you are in the process of working on a partfor instance in the preproduction in the preopening periods of a partwhen you say what kind of life did this guy lead your conclusions must be not only theoryyou follow you must be able to bridge the gap between theory and experience sometimes so that in other words to play a coal miner you can read all you want about coal mining but just to know what the feel of the area is at the entrance of a coal mine is experience thats worth more than the ten volumes youll read about it so that i dont mean that the gift is there and it just begins to kick over no you nurture it and you work with it and its your responsibility now if youre going to be an artist and this is where you say this is my functionthen thats what you are in life if you are going to be a carpenter and you go through the growing pains of learning how to measure and cut and saw and nail and then if you walk away from itafter you learn ityou cant go back to it in ten years and build a house and also when you walk away from it it is because you are notyou have not committed yourself to it i commit to the theatre i commit to art thats me im thirtythree years old i have no place else to goyou follow and the only reasons i know i amthat are of importance to meare the reasons i get from my work from my milieu as an artist and from my contribution interviewer but success tends to put you in a hothouse in a comfortable hothousedoesnt it poitier success tends to put the american artist in a hothouse and it is ajust one of the many temptations potential indulgences that the artist has to face up to interviewer but how do you grow then poitier i live in a certain way i make a great deal of money and i live in new york i live in westchester i live in a lowermiddleincome community i am not ghettoized here i can live anywhere i want to live in new york state and if they wont sell me a house ill buy the land and build a house i am not ghettoized i live in a certain way i move in every circlei have to i am interested fortunately in many things im interested in politics im interested in economics im interested in art see im interested in hunger and im interested inin oppressions im interested in the independence of the african and asian states im interested in the power of the church im interested in the lack of civil liberties in the soviet union im interested in a lot of thingsbirth control and oldage pensions assistance for the aged im interested in a lot of things and im notfortunately i am not trying to force an interest i am genuinely interested in these things so i dont i mean the success is not an end interviewer how do you choose your roles do you choose them because of the acting opportunities that are available to you or do you choose them in combination with their significance to you poitier i choose my roles nowi must differentiate because in the past i was always selective only not for snobbish reasons i was always selective because most of the parts offered me were of no interest to me and i refused them and that was that the difference now is that the parts that are offered to me if they interest me and they are not quite right i get help to fix them i look for certain things not in the part only but in the play if a play or a film has a commentmind you comment is different from a statementif a play has a comment that transcends itself then i will be interested in doing it now what do i mean by a play that transcends itself if the plays comment can be made dimensionally clearly forcefully to everyone who sees it whatever their country whatever their language as long as its a man or a woman or a child of this milieu in our contemporary worldthen the play has significance for me i do not wish to make a comment that is peculiar only to a section of this country or of this world i do not wish to make a comment that is peculiar to negroes only or on behalf of negroes only i am not interested in the comment that is on behalf of americans only i cannot any more be thusly interested i want to say if im able something about people and i believe that basically people are the same everywhere if they are literate or not if they are sophisticated rich poor russian american black whitebasically they are the same and art can touch them all in the same place you see the same piece of art can touch them all that which touches only the black man not understood by the white is really not accomplishing much because ofttimes that which is understood by the black and not by the white is poison and in and of itself it becomes contradictory to the purposes intended interviewer i was going to ask you what if any difference do you find in preparation for the stage and for the films poitier there is a difference in the preparation and there is a difference in the performance on the stage in terms of the preparation you have two months or more depending on how soon you get the script or whatever your working habits are and how important you are sometimes you get a script three four months in advance you begin working then then you have the fourweek period of rehearsals and then you have a tryout usually and then you come in prepared to work two hours a night and twice on wednesdays and saturdays in the film your preparation at least mine takes a different course there are different demands made by the two mediums the stages limitations are of a nature that they make certain kinds of demands which require adjustments in the technique or in the approach to work the film makes similar demands according to its needs and limitations in the film i prepare pretty much the same way and when i am doneafter the two months or three months of preparationwhen i am done i have to begin to work in bits and pieces on what is in essence on performance which carries over an eight or tenweek period so what i do is i begin to experience each day the total up to the point i am performing so that there is a flow now how to experience it i dont sit and go through excruciating pains i just review in my mind the flow the natural flow of events involving me to this point so that i can seque into this moment this three minutes they intend to shoot today but naturally and connectedly interviewer you find the movies harder than the stage poitier yes interviewer i understand you have said in some earlier interviews that you find that the technical intrusion of cameras bothers you poitier well thats only a part of it you see the film iswell the best way to give you an example i came here at ten oclock let us assume that this is a stage and its a performance and i come in and i spend an hour here and all that we have done this morning in this interview was actually a portion of a play but i came in and i had one continuous hour in which to perform or experience if it is a film the total when it is done will be the hour similar to what we spent here but it does not flow in that manner i will come here every day for thirtysix days and i will work with you and you will work with me and in the course of one day our total the aggregate of our film time will be three minutesyou see and each day i come i must through whatever senses awareness i possessi must thread yesterdays needle with todays thread so that it would seem that no time has elapsed that is difficult now we are able in films to get around it easily because its a very technical medium and you can cut up film and nobody really cares about the performance you know unless you yourself are interested so to make a wholethat in life in a lifelike experience will unfold in an hour or two or threeto put it together bit by bit is like patchquilt work the job of the artist if he is interested is to make it seem that this is a total experience when it is done that makes it more difficult than the stage infinitely more difficult but by the same token it is in films where if someone is not interestedthe medium is a haven because he can hide behind other things the medium permits an actor to be lazy if he wishes if he has a winning personality and a nice face to look at and a not displeasing voice he can read words and move around in an attempt at playing and get away with it easier than he can on the stage because on the stage he has only one frame you see on the screen he has the twolens and the fourlens and a fiftylens and a seventyfive lens so that his image comes to us in gears it comes that way this way you know and we see all kinds of images of him and he comes so close to us we can almost touch him on the stage he remains in the same dimension so theres nothing going for him there except his work interviewer youve been playing serious roles what about comic ones i understand from what ive been reading about you that you have a talent for comedy poitier i would like to try that very much and i am going to i am sure that it will have to be as a result of my own efforts because i am now used to being thought of as a heavy actor interviewer what do you think are the prospects for the negro actor in america poitier ah good question i think they are good if the negro actor is a gifted actor and he develops himself he will work cannot help but work there will be very few limitations on the negro actor truly gifted in the future the countrythe pace of change socially in america has accelerated so that the negro actor of today is experiencing more hope and more involvement in the theatre and in pictures than ever before television and the radio are a littlestill behind the times but picturewise its coming marvelously the stage also in music and theatre and art generally the power of the gift is what counts for the most part another artist who is white if he is committed to art and he finds a gift in a black man or woman he has to use it he has to work with ityou followbecause that is his commitment like in musici dont care how sick a white musician who is dedicated to music is on the race question he would go out of his skull to play with miles davis he would go out of his skull to play with him so that directors and writers producers even who are really interested in working on a certain artistic level if they find an actor who is a mexican actor or a white actor or a black actor or a chinese actor who has great power they have to use him now on a workaday level lots has yet to be accomplished for the actor who is just soso the soso negro actor will not work with the consistency that the soso white actor works because the negro is unfortunately still in that kind of social thing but there is hope there is much hope the salvation of the negro actor also will be realized through the realization of negro writers in the theatre all kinds of good things are pointing to it interviewer what advice would you give to the beginning negro actor in terms of training for the stage poitier i would give him the same advice that i would give to the beginning actor of any other race and that is to study hard and long and fierce if you control the methods of work then you can in essence control your growth or help to control your growth if you are unable to control the body or the mind under certain work situations then youll find that youll never be able to play any one part completely the only tools you have areis the body how you move how you speak everything you do with the body becomes the essence of your work aside from learning the other aspects of acting controlling the body is the most important interviewer i vould like to extend the question a little bit i accept the fact that the advice you would give would be regardless of color but i wonder in terms of psychological or philosophical approach or attitudehow would you guide a young negro actor so that he doesnt become embittered let us say at lack of opportunity poitier let him become embittered i think that bitterness is also a fruit of life if bitterness was an end result directed toward no one else then we wouldnt mind bitterness we object to bitterness because we dont wish to be the object of it i think that bitterness is an absolutely correct reaction to some of the absurdities perpetuated on negroes in this country i will not say to a young negro actor dont become bitter if he earns the right to be bitter by god let him be bitter i do say to him earn the right to be bitter go and prepare yourself to be an artist and if you become an artistif you are on your way to realizing your potential as an artistand some bastards superimpose restrictions on your efforts get as bitter as you wantyou follow interviewer on the other hand bitterness in your own private life can be a disturbing element isnt there some approach to peace with yourself poitier are you asking if there is a way to tranquilize oneself against the intrusions of all the injustices no there isnt any way to tranquilize oneself what the negro actor should do or the negro person per se should do is not to be concerned about bitterness because it is an experience and out of it usually comes some very profound constructive philosophical attitudeusually you see and it is not essentially an adjustment because if the persons who are so busy creating these obstacles for minorities in this country if they themselves ever were to experience what those people the minorities go through they would be better human beings themselves i believe that you cannot be full in this life until you know what pain is until you know what joys are and instead of spending a lifetime like most whites in this country running from pain setting up an antiseptic life struggling and working and closing out nailing out all the adversitiespain and a little hardship and struggleand becoming essentially antiseptic i think that the more antiseptic they become the more lack of soul becomes evident so i have no great horror for bitterness on the part of negroes negroes are becoming less bitter and its marvelous that they are but the experience of bitterness has beenwill beused by them in marvelous ways you know the venom of a snake can kill and it can also be an antidote correct so i dont want to say to negroes dont be bitter if they are in a situation that provokes the bitterness let them be bitter and when the situation through their effort or through the collective effort of both sides is overcome when they overcome the bitterness then they have a frame of reference then theyve had that experience you see and it is the experience that will make of them the better manif they overcome it if they get through it do you follow interviewer i was going to ask you do you think that a negro star of your stature has problems different from the problems of a white star of your stature poitier im sure that some of my problems are peculiar to negroes but i donti dont let them bug me sometimes some of the things are painfulnot too often sometimes they hurtnot too often i dont worry about it its an experience now and usually i am ablethrough my transcending my bitternessto some extent i am able to view very compassionately the inadequacies the gigantic limitations that enmesh the perpetuators of these moments of pain for me and i do dismiss them for they are afflicted infinitely more than i interviewer living here in mount vernon and raising your children herehow do you equate this experience poitier i have an interest in not losing my balance and i also have an interest in keeping my children in a certain kind of multiracial cultural milieu and i fear antiseptic living i fear it it leads to alcohol and nicotine and a kind of stagnation intellectually and im not interested in that interviewer i read also that you dont let them know too much about your success is that true poitier yes the magnitude of my good fortune commercially is nothing whatever for them to be dealing with at this time in their lives i wish them always to have a frame of reference for everything and if they have a father who is so unlike other fathers it will begin to give them a kind of orientation that can be unhealthy its my feeling that my childrenfirst let them be children and let them be children as fully as they can be children you see and theyll deal with what their father is and theyll have toprobably have toovercome it at a later time interviewer what are the frustrations of the negro actorthat is in the ability to use the full range of his talents poitier what are the frustrations of the negro actor interviewer i mean have you yet encountered frustrations as a negro actor in being limited let us say to certain roles poitier no honestly not yet i am entering now into an area careerwise where i am sure i will bei will be involved with the frustrations because i am now interested in the kind of work as i described to you before of a certain reach and if i am not offered it i will have to try to bring about its realization by myself meaning ill produce it myself so i havent really experienced it yet ive been busy building a career and trying not to make too many outlandish compromises but now im interested in moving on to another level interviewer what is that level actually poitier well first a level of workand a level of comment they are not necessarily compatible if you must mix them but they each represent individually a step up from what has been the pattern for many years on the artistic side there is now an urgent need to do better work i think i have the potential for better work so i now must stretch interviewer what do you consider better work how do you consider an actor should progress in his career poitier better work for me now would beat least ive thought it would beto reach for a level of work that is commensurate with say another dimension in acting as in all art there is a constant reaching for another depth well the frame of reference for your trying to plumb the depths is to bring about a dimension that is almost indistinguishable from reality you see so that and that is a big task but it is interesting enough to me if i never come close it would at least permit me cause mein reaching for it to stretch myself artistically there is a dimension not yet tampered with at least by me and that is to be able to work on a parin such a way that when the experience happens it has about it an encompassing effect on an audience encompassing in that they become a part of the total so that there is not a theatre and there is not a stage now this is done in many other fields you see it is done quite often by musicians you can sit down and listen to music and in no time your mind stops thinking about business it stops and it isnt even concentrating on the music it sort of suspends itself and for a while there is nothing but a kind of total moment with the music and you and the nothingness it happens when we are speaking about something that interests us fiercely and especially when someone is saying what we want to hear we become hypnotized with our eyes wide open and we arewe are hung you see i think actors can weave this spell because in the old days storytellers wove these spells in market places all over the world hundreds of years ago thousands of years ago not with the aid of lights and sets and all that jazz so the actor can do it interviewer going back to a raisin in the sun i recall that mr atkinson in the times said that you were as effective when you had words to say as when you were silent obviously you conveyed that excitement from many directions you have much encouragement in achieving your goal poitier well see how the next step goes interviewer i gather that you are studying shakespeare that you have hopes to perform in shakespeare is that true poitier that is no longer true interviewer why is that poitier well i am i was interested in shakespeareveryand then i found a very interesting truth and it is thisi found i was interested in shakespeare because of a kind of coercion interviewer a coercion poitier yes i was coerced into an interest in shakespeare by the awesomeness of its reputation by the correctness of a man of my position having to at one point or another say that i would like to play shakespeare it is the thing to do and it is the comment to make and i started reading it and i kept saying id like to play shakespeare but it seems to be actually a status symbol toto reach a point where you can say all right i want to play shakespeare i dont want to play shakespeare essentially first because i am not trained sufficiently to play shakespeare most of shakespeares stuff bores me to tears i enjoy infinitely more to read the words because the man was indeed a geniusjust to read the structure of his sentences i lie in bed with a shakespeare book and have a ball to play it im not interested its that simple interviewer thats a very sound confession i think that even in writing to reach beyond your interests is purely a form of snobbism poitier now it would be reaching beyond my interests if i do change my mind because of additional information or because of additional changes in my values ill play it i will begin to prepare again to play it but as of now i am in a period where i would much prefer just to read it just to read it because to read it is an experience its very wonderful its relaxing and itsits a kind of freedom you experience reading it to realize that a mind or a man was so gifted to put words together in this order it is fantastic interviewer why is it that youve concentrated your energiesand this may be an obvious or rhetorical question or maybe even naive but i think that it should be asked and i think i know part of the answer but why is it that youve confined your interests to hollywood in opposition to the stage poitier because i have three children and one on the way by the way and a wife a mother and father a motherinlaw and various and sundry other relations who are not as fortunate as i and who in some manner or other depend on me for livelihood i cannot work long under the constant pressure of or the call of the economic so i am doing my two years in hollywood style my deals are so constructed that two more jobs and my relatives and i will not have to respond economically to pressuremeaning that its a tricky business and i understand it very well the business of it if i have no money and wish to remain in the theatre i must fight a constant battle of integrity versus the icebox you see i find it disconcerting to do that if i have to do it because of my circumstances are such then i would do it but i have seen a way to circumvent its being a constant thorn in my side when my success came as fledgling as it is my representatives and i sat down and we determined to get me a work relation with the people i work for of a nature that i can be paid over a long period of time rather than to take monies up front so my monies now areand its all legal taxwisepaid to me in a livable sum on the first of january every year for twentyfive years which leaves me free of that consideration so that after the picture in paris and one additional job of work which is in early spring i can do as much theatre for as long as i wish anywhere in the world interviewer can we expect you next season in the theatre poitier you can very well expect me next season interviewer there is something on the way poitier there are some things being talked about i do want to go on the stage but not to the exclusion of films i want but see simply if you are offered one hundred fifty thousand dollars for a job thats an awful lot of money and they give it to you and the government gets sixty thousand dollars your agent gets fifteen thousand dollars thats seventyfive thousand dollars the state of california gets three or five and the state of new york gets and this gets and that gets so you wind up with about thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars now the forty thousand dollars if you live at a clip of ten thousand dollars a year lasts you four years but if you have one hundred fifty thousand dollars and the government permits you to spread that money and you take twenty thousand dollars a year thats seven and a half years then you do another film for the same company and you stretch the seven and a half years to fifteen then you work for another company and you take ten for fifteenyou see interviewer i know you rejected a role in a filmthat phenix city story roleand i wanted to know a little more about why you rejected it poitier the role was a cheat in the context of what the film dealt with the part was a cheat and a compromise it was a lie an absolute outandout lie and they used it in an uncourageous manner it was the part of a young negro father during the political and criminal holocaust in phenix city alabama or phenix city somewhere in the south and its an open city gambling and corruption and this father because he worked for somebody or did something his daughter was killed and thrown on the lawn and the father goes out hunting for the killer and toward the end of the film he comes across him and hes got him in a shed and hes gonna kill him and they put in his mouth the most ugly compromise if it were an honest change of heart the man had it could have been beautiful because it would have shown great growth you see but they put in his mouth such crappy words like i suddenly realize that the lord doesnt want me to do this interviewer and they wouldnt change it to meet your ideas poitier i was at that time a sevenhundredfiftydollar actor for the whole thingyou know three weeks for the seven hundred fifty dollars i was making two hundred dollars a week or three hundred dollars a week interviewer what has been your favorite role poitier my favorite there is no such thing interviewer then which was the most challenging role lets put it that way and why poitier again there is no such thing there is no easy part to play really i used to think there was but there isnt during the work every part even when youre having a miserable time is an important part because it is a challenge to you whatever the extenuating circumstances aresuch as a bad director or a disinterested group of fellow actors the product the finished product becomes a challenge because you have a job of work that has to be done that has to be good and you know that you can work good so that each job has to like be up to snuff you know you must notch up another so however you feel about the part there is that kind of sense ofyou do what you have to do and if you fail its sickening so each parteven the ones that you look back in retrospect and say i didnt like itat least the working on it was as honest as any other there is no enthusiasm for a part only when you have no interest in the play you see and i dont work like that i work with enthusiasm because i am interested in the things i do and when i work at it i work as fully as i can interviewer you said before that its important for the artist to experience and to live do you make it your business for instance to study people of all colors and races do you return to harlem to refresh your memory and experience of what life in harlem is like do you go out to chicago or go down south to keep in touch with the problems and experiences of people of your race poitier i do not only with people in harlemi go to harlem almost every day i have friends there and i am there almost every day i go in two guises i go as myself and sometimes i goi go as anonymously as i can and its an experience but its a very rewarding one it keeps me alive in certain areas of my consciousness let me explain harlem to you in harlem i am not a stranger nor am i a did the south win the civil war by howard n meyer t he initial phase of the civil war centennial commemorative program had its climax on april at charleston s c with a national assembly of participating organizations the opening sale of a u s postage stamp designed to mark the firing on fort sumter and the dedication of a monument to the southerner who fired the first shot at his countrys flag a century ago the commission which is presiding over the commemorative program was quietly created in by a congress dominated by southern democrats its membership was appointed by president eisenhower vicepresident nixon and house speaker sam rayburn this group has arranged the details of a fouryear historical pageant the importance of which cannot be overlooked it will influence tremendously the attitude of millions of young americansespecially school childrentoward the war its causes and its effects one is first tempted to say that the commissions plans have been marked by a kind of equal treatment reverence as much for the stars and bars as for the stars and stripes honor as much for jefferson davis as for abraham lincoln tributes for the boys in gray as much as the boys in blue equality that is for all except the negro but actually the union hasnt received equal treatment there was a reenactment of lincolns inaugural and thats all on the confederate side there has been a celebration of the shots fired on the star of the north a u s naval relief ship for sumter a recreation of the confederate constitutional convention and a week of festivities to celebrate the memory of the inauguration of jefferson davis with the man and the hour pageant with a cast of antebellum style shows and mansion tours commemoration ball costume all this was happily announced under the signature of general u s grant iii chairman of the commission and grandson of the soldier who crushed the rebellion chairman grant is eighty years old and apparently still accepts the ideology that prevailed during his turnofthecentury youth that northsouth reconciliation is more important than the human rights of the negro the relationship of the civil war to civil_rights is of course intimate ironic and tragic yet it was privately decided in the centennial planning to suppress all reference to the moral and political issues at stakeand decided one had thoughtin the war the commission revealed in a report to congress in which went unchallenged that the heirs of the secessionists in the state governments of the south were to control the ideological content of all ceremonies such observances should not be directed from washington they should spring into being in response to the wish of the people in each political subdivision the result was that as may be seen in the plans unfolding now only military events and human tragedy are to be commemorated not the extension of american liberty to all men the commissions policies are accurately expressed in its only widely distributed publication a booklet for public information called facts about the civil war this slickpaper twocolor brochure in which the stars and bars of the confederacy on the inside front cover dominates the stars and stripes only slightly resembles nothing so much as a souvenir program for a northsouth stadium extravaganza there is even a section describing the military forces of under the caption the starting lineups it is what the brochure does not say however rather than what it does that is most important a man from mars or stanleyville or vientiane after reading the twenty pages of this factpacked product of the commission would not know that the war was about anything the word negro is not used nor is it mentioned that human slavery was involved in the conflict although the brochure offers a compendium of every conceivable type of statistic about the war the reader will not learn that negro soldiers made up twelve per cent of the victorious northern army and that they sustained eighteen per cent of the union fatalities there is no mention in the nine pages of detailed statistical summary of the hundred and twenty negro infantry regiments nor of the twentytwo negro artillery regiments nor of the seven negro cavalry regiments that helped defeat the rebellion until a quarter of a century ago there would have been nothing surprising about the choice of values made by the commission even today many school textbooks throughout the country are oriented to blame an unnecessary civii war on the abolitionists and to rationalize the secession as forced by the fanaticism of northern statesmen like charles sumner it is not often mentioned that the negro wanted freedom and that he helped to fight for it then too the conventional textbook blames the postreconstruction subjugation of the southern negro on the victim who was ignorant and did not know what to do with freedom all this is a byproduct of the white souths counterattack which by had completed an ideological conquest of the north and a socioeconomic reconquest of the southern negro this postwar conquest by the white south seemed impregnable until a few short years ago the herald of its certain and final defeat was the desegregation decision of the supreme court of which wiped out the memory of an earlier courts acceptance of jim crow but while segregationwith all its implicationshas been defeated and is in retreat it has not surrendered and the harsh fact of everyday life in the deep south is that the white minority favoring resistance to the authority of the united states and rebellion against the constitutional warrant of the supreme court still rules attempts to bring about a token beginning of compliance with the courts ruling have been brought to a standstill in virginia the presence of a governorcongressman from that state as vicechairman of the centennial commission may in part prehaps account for the makeup of the following portion of the description given in the chairmans name of the nature of the centennial what will the civil war centennial be like it will last four years battles will be reenacted many on a huge scale colorful ceremonies will be held exhibitions of war trophies and mementos organized there will be memorials parades new historical markers and a great many special ceremonies virginia which played so great a role in the war is building a centennial center at richmond the capital of the confederacy and restoring and marking its historic battlefields one of the most famous is that of bull run next summer the sights and sounds of the yearold battle will be recreated some men will restage the battle for an audience that will include the president the governor of virginia and many other dignitaries general lees memorable cry will once more ring out over that historic field there stands jackson like a stone wall rally behind the virginians the stone wall of it might be said is one that keeps little children out of the schools that the constitution has been held to entitle them to attend for it has been estimated that if school desegregation continues at the pace of the last seven years it will take four thousand years before every child in the south is placed in a schoolroom to which access is organized in conformity with federal constitutional requirements that creeping pace is determined now by those in the south who have seceded from obedience to court rulings and the plans of the centennial commission to date are aid and comfort to them as only one example is it mere coincidence that it was in montgomery alabama that the most elaborate and prolonged ritual in observance of the birth of the confederacy was staged in february and that martial law was needed to protect a meeting in a negro church in may a federal body appointed to consider how to mark the one hundredth anniversary of the war of emancipation should have been aware of the historical role of the cult of the confederacy as propagandacamouflage behind which was completed the defeat of reconstruction and the degradation of the negro in the late nineteenth century the object of the cult was to bring about the acceptance of a threepart myth that the south fought nobly for an ideal that deserved the blood shed for it that the old south laid waste by the war was a fine romantic noble place and that the romantic noblemen who lived there did more for their slaves than the latter could or ever would do for themselves the fable of the old south and the myth of the lost cause were dissected a few years ago by professor c vann woodward of johns hopkins in his origins of the new south he explored the economic links between the converted whigs of the postreconstruction new south and the northern industrial republicans of the gilded age who invested there in connection with that alliance one of the most significant inventions of the new south was the old southa new idea in the eighties and a legend of incalculable potentialities shortly after the war the louisville courierjournal said the bonny blue flag is the symbol of nothing to the present generation of southern men the southern confederacy went down forever fifteen years ago its issues and ensigns went down with it a few years later however jefferson davis was resurrected from his political exile to help mend the fences of a corrupt local politician in georgia he was borne up and down his old dominions to a continuous ovation the lost cause was then retrieved from historys discard to become a way of life in the united daughters of the confederacy was organized in the capital of the new south atlanta only then when the movement was taken into custody by southern womanhood did the cult of the lost cause assume a religious character monuments were planted in courthouse squares usually the figure of a soldier facing north gun in hand the success of southern apologists meant not merely that the confederate side of the war was hygenized and glamorized the cause of the north was correspondingly demeaned moreover it was consistent with the needs of the exploding postwar economy of the east that there should be distorted and suppressed the meaning of the most humanistic and progressive period of american political thought the period of abolitionism and transcendentalism of the underground railroad and brook farm was swept under the rug it is part of that development that when one thinks today of the word abolitionist one associates it with fanatic or zealot accordingly such figures as william lloyd garrison wendell phillips charles sumner and yes thaddeus stevens have been cruelly dealt with these men form a noble part of our national heritage and it is not a matter of sectional pride that raises the point the rebels may have manufactured the myth of the old south but it was the yankees who accepted it the new south wanted the moral significance of abolition to be forgotten but it was the new north that did the forgetting the guilty responsibility for the century of deferral of true emancipation of the negro is heavy enough to be shared through all america including those of us of immigrant stock who accepted from the nineties to the fifties the tainted gift of white supremacy as a compensation for our own secondclass citizenship when john jay chapman spoke at coatesville pennsylvania in in memory of a particularly brutal lynching of a year before he traced its roots to the wickedness of all america and of three hundred yearsthe wickedness of the slave trade all of us are tinctured by it no special place no special persons are to blame the crime of the southern redeemers who overthrew the reconstruction governments was shared by the northern conservatives who had tired of the negro by and left him to his terrible fate the civil war should be commemorated but not in a manner that drains it of all meaning in military dumb shows and not in a manner which emboldens those guilty today of offenses identified with the secession lincolns second inaugural address closed with an appeal for malice toward none and charity for all but it did establish what the conflict was about one eighth of the population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces but let us judge not that we be not judged there was courage and devotion and tragedy on both sides during the civil war it does not detract from the magnificent heroism of the men of the south nor does it deny the sacrifice of its women to insist that the cause that was lost was founded on an evil one does not have to deny the tragedy of blasted homes and lives to say that the old south depended on an iniquitous social system that could not be tolerated in america it does not serve america well in the world of to ignore the evil and iniquity of slavery in marking the centennial of the conflict our country is still tom at home and dishonored abroad because of the victory snatched from the jaws of reconstruction by the side that had lost the war that victory was the establishment of the prerogative of the former slave states to impose segregation in place of chattel slavery as the basis of race relations james m dabbs the southerner who heads the southern regional the gar the union veterans organization that eisenhower had often saluted those who wore one uniform and fought under one flag fought for their country and were right while those who wore the other uniform and fought under the other banner fought against their country and were wrong no sentimentality and no commercial efforts to efface these radical differences should be encouraged by any true patriot a similar thought had occurred to the founding fathers of they had provided in article iii of the constitution that treason against the united states shall consist in levying war against them when the firing on fort sumter was reenacted in a setting of live oaks and magnolias who was there to remind the playactors in ever so small a voice that the original shot was after all treason all here and now his voice was soft and gentle and yet there seemed to be steel hidden away somewhere in it it was courteous and full of appeal and yet there was something grim and frightening in it every word used was full of meaning and seemed to carry a deadly earnestness thus nehru described the spectacular novel protest of gandhis satyagraha movement against the repressive rowlatt acts in india in his tribute to gandhi is now an apt description of the american negros protest through various forms of nonviolent action against an oppressive culture dominated by whites until satyagraha the use of soul force and truth force in nonviolent noncooperative protest against oppression was unknown in india in satyagraha gandhi combined concepts of peaceful civil disobedience from thoreau and tolstoi and added his own contribution by applying these concepts successfully to political relationships gandhi developed his ideas and methods in south africa and then brought them to india he introduced a new kind of i warfare a warfare which renounced hostility against human beings but which used nonviolent weapons against injustice twentyeight years later due partly to the coercive power of the gandhian technique of nonviolent resistance british rule ended in india since satyagraha is the method now being used by american negroes against racial oppression we must understand this movement for what it is in the first place it is obvious that negroes in the movement refuse to retaliate in kind or to do violence to human life it is less obvious but equally true that they do not use verbal violence or yield to hatred they seek justice and rely heavily on a silent appeal to the conscience of the oppressor the power of this method when it is applied in a society which gives even lip service to christian faith should not be underestimated the negro is fighting and effectively he is deliberately breaking local laws and violating local customs which demean his dignity and deprive him of the rights and benefits guaranteed by a higher law he is doing so in the hope that such disobedience will eventually compel the white man to grant him justice he is courting unjust imprisonment as a means of laying upon the conscience of the nation his legitimate claim to full citizenship he is reluctantly but voluntarily suffering assaults by white ruffians in the confidence that justice will be returned to him for his suffering his warfare is soft and gentle but there is steel hidden away somewhere in it it is courteous and full of appeal and yet grim and frightening this is not a passive but an active protest which rejects violence but is nevertheless coercive which renounces hatred and hostility but is nevertheless aggressive and compelling the negro protest is militantly nonviolent satyagraha has come to america such warfare thus defined and limited is just regrettably necessary and potentially successful most americans find it grim and frightening obviously it is painful and terrifying to southern racists who have never met such opposition before and do not know how to cope with it what can be done to men and women who endure beatings welcome imprisonment and are willing to die if necessary for a just cause the negros nonviolent action is also frightening to the moderates who have been willing to champion the humble negroat least verballybut who are now confronted for the first time by the novel spectacle of a proud selfconfident negro who knows what is his and serves notice that he intends to take it the negros nonviolent protest if not frightening is certainly grim business for its leaders they know or should that there are two perils which always accompany the successes of such a movement first the nouveau proud having won for themselves a legitimate selfconfidence must resist the temptation to let pride deteriorate into vanity and haughtiness they must do so not to cajole the white man but to retain that ingredient of selfsurrender which is indispensable to the continuing success of a nonviolent crusade second there is always the danger that a nonviolent movement through exasperation over delayed successes will get out of hand and become a violent movement that a bloodless revolution will become a bloody one on three occasions between and gandhis followers inadequately disciplined in the techniques of satyagraha resorted to mob violence doing harm to human life and to their own cause on each occasion gandhi called off his nonviolent crusade over the objections of his closest associates and did personal penance through fasting for the violence of his people the same peril with even more disastrous consequences faces the peaceful rebellion of american negroes if the ranks of those who resist oppression in nonviolent action are infiltrated by negroes and whites who are not disciplined in peaceful resistance or if the negroes desert wise leadership and resort to the violence preached by the black muslims justice and freedom for the negro in america will suffer a profound reversal it is a grim and frightening business for the nation when the negro has to launch what is nothing less than a peaceful revolution in order to claim what the laws of the i country guarantee to all its citizens the shame and the weakness of the nation are exposed and its soli j darity is threatened the enemies of the united states do not need to fabricate scurrilous propaganda in order to discredit the intentions of the united states in its dealings with the colored peoples of the world they need only to report in the congo in laos in venezuela what has actually happened in alabama mississippi and louisiana the most devastating propaganda circulated against the united states from moscow and peking is written in the deeds done in the deep south and in the racial ghettos of northern cities the naive pompous assertion that it does not matter what the rest of the world thinks about the united states is refuted each day in the news from africa asia and latin america and most of all the negros nonviolent revolution should be a grim warning to white christian churches james t mccain south carolina field secretary for the congress of racial equality recently declared that the emancipation proclamation freed the negro physically the supreme j court decision freed him men j segregated public schools unconstitutional only per cent of the negro children attend desegregated schools in an area encompassing southern and border states and the district of columbia four of these states defy the supreme court decision altogether and five make only a token compliance gradualism is a science in which southern legislators and southern courts are extraordinarily proficient therefore the negro through sitins and freedom rides leapfrogs local laws and prejudiced local courts on his way toward civil_rights which national laws have assured him the negro has waited years for his proclaimed emancipation to become a reality he is no longer in a waiting mood he wants all that belongs to him and he wants it here and now a revolution is under way in this country beginning in the south it may spread wherever injustice reigns how long it will last and whether it will be peaceful depends on the dedication and discipline of negroes on the willingness of the white south to surrender repressive customs and nullify oppressive laws on the capacity of the american people to recognize in time how urgent it is that all americans be permitted to rise to the full dignity of liberty and equality the partys over at border state schools by larry whiteside sk the average coach at a nonnorthern major college or university and hell usually tell you quite bluntly give me some good negro ball players and ill give you a winning team conceited as it may sound there is a lot of truth in that statement if you base your judgment on the heavy recruiting that major schools all over the country are doing in the negro ranks these days truth however is a precise word discovered only after examining all the facts and more and more coaches are learning we regret to report that the mere presence of negroes on a major college team is not the only ingredient of a winning combination major colleges were once very cautious when they recruited a negro athlete they stuck with the super stars and because of that a host of great athletes became legends in their own lifetimes start a list of legendary negro athletes and you could go on and on duke slater jesse owens ralph metcalfe jackie robinson marion motley buddy young wilt chamberlain oscar robertson etc the list could grow at every thought these men proved to the world that the negro athlete could hold his own with anyone often theirs was a lonely and thankless fight but they made their point now almost every major college except those of the deep south aims its recruiting program at promising young negro athletes with hopes of that allimportant winning team but like dr frankenstein these colleges may have in the making a monster situation which can run out of control unless some serious thinking is doneand soon recruiting the superstar was no problem he was usually the only negro on the team and was treated more or less royally he was the negro star on a team of white players few gave it more thought than that but today the partys over for the superstar and the time has come for nonnorthem schools and northern schools too to realize that problems resulting from the presence of a large number of negroes on a team are cropping up and must be solved now generally speaking the problem reminds one of the old riddle wherein a man looks at identical chickens and is told to pick six good ones and a half dozen of the other kind similarlv coaches y are faced with the problem of choosing between one or many negro athletes it poses the question for him of how many players are too many and how few are not enough public opinion being what it is he has to be extra careful less he be branded a pioneer for having too many and prejudiced for having too few in many areas of the country the problem is small iowa for instance had nine negro starters at one time on its football team last season and was quite successful eastern schools have been dotted with negro talent for years and most of the top track schools can band together a crack allnegro relay unit these however are generally northern or western schools where little trouble is expected anyway the nonnorthem but not particularly southern school is the new proving ground and is where the greatest work must be done kansas a border state lying between the liberal north and the traditional south provided an excellent example of some of the problems that can develop it is a nonnorthem school in a state rich in the history of pioneering for civil_rights the first negro basketball player in the the big eight conference lavannes squires was a kansan and it produced what many people still claim was the biggest of the super basketball stars wilt chamberlain last season the jayhawks fielded a team with seven negroes on it it was a far cry from the days when wilt the stilt hit the scene wilt came to kansas like a meteor that glared brightly almost blinding the people of that farm state with his skill and then suddenly sputtering so quickly as to leave them breathless he was a superstar in the purest sense of the word and probably had more influence than any other player on the thinking of the people of the southwest about accepting negro athletes while the dipper was there the conference was stormy and exciting he was a huge sevenfoot negro who loomed as a tower of strength on any floor he appeared racially he was abused misused misunderstood loved and hated throughout his abbreviated career but he held his ground for three years and took whatever he had to until the lure of big money and professional ball lured him away from kansas in the start of his senior year few big northern athletes had gone to nonnorthern major universities up to that time after chamberlain there would be many to follow up until then the big eight picked its negro stars from the near midwest and the south this all changed after chamberlain left and negroes on conference as well as other southwestern teams are becoming commonplace but ironically kansas the school that started it all wound up last season having the most trouble ku had seven negroes on its basketball team including wayne hightower a much sought after prep allamerican who as a junior was rated by many as the outstanding allaround player in the big eight a correll and ralph heyward two former prep allamericans from philadelphia were on the roster as was bill bridges an allbig eight center and workhorse of the team two sophomores nolen ellison and jim dumas gave kansas two local allstate standouts and butch ellison brother of nolen was one of kansas outstanding junior college players before enrolling at ku here were seven stars from such varied states as kansas new mexico and pennsylvania of the white players only two de ketchum and jerry gardner appeared capable of matching the talents of these negro athletes the nine of them gave kansas what most observers called the best talent in the league everything in fact seemed right for a great year the coaches thought so even the players agreed that kansas would be tough to beat but these rich hopes never materialized and the bubble began to burst even before the season started kansas lost the preseason christmas tournament after being a heavy favorite after that people began to have doubts and made no secret in expressing them they started asking embarrassingbut then timely questions were there too many negroes on the team was there dissension among white and negro players did the coach play favorites whats wrong with kansas at midseason when heyward was lost because of scholastic difficulties the very serious and academic question finally popped upwas kansas sacrificing its standards with these negro players to build a winning team as the teams fortunes grew worse the abuse heightened the school nickname soon changed from jayhawks to blackhawks the racial taunts heretofore unnoticed picked up with such intensity until it provided the spark needed to start the yearly brawl at the kansasmissouri game in columbia mo kumu fights have been going on long before either school had negroes but to a nationwide tv audience not familiar with the situation a racial fracas was what it looked like the only persons who could accurately answer those questions were coach dick harp and the players their views often differed harp considered one of the big eights warmest coaches took issue with those who criticized him we knew we had seven negro players but we didnt think it would cause any problem we tried to get the best ball players available but had no intentions of sacrificing the standards of the university to build a winning team people talked about dissension on our team but if there was i surely didnt see it our kids i think realized who should be playing and if there was any resentment it was no more than you would normally have from any player who in his opinion thought he should be in the lineup more during the season in fact no one even approached me or questioned me on the subject though im sure there was some dissatisfaction for the players angle one would naturally turn to hightower the teams superstar a graduate of philadelphias overbrook high school the same school that produced chamberlain he was a handpicked replica of wilt and was expected to bring kansas the one thing the dipper had failed to do a national title there were many similiarities about the two men both came to kansas with big reputations to live up to both took command of any floor they were on and tried to be the center of attention both were crowd pleasers and high scorers both were aloof from the rest of the student body a great deal of the time both caught hell in every game home or away the similarity has to end there for unlike wilt hightower had a temper and proved moody on and off the court he developed from a mild freshman to the stormy character of his junior year and quit at the end of the school year hightower never caught the fans favor as did chamberlain especially after he privately and publicly avowed his dislike of the state with him as leader kansas fans complained that they couldnt identify themselves with the team a rebel by nature hightower displayed what most people called a lack of humility on and off the court and this often caused him more grief they preferred bridges the new mexicoborn center who kept his mouth shut and hustled all game but as the superstar hightower best could speak of the problems faced for he knew them well perhaps better than the whole group combined none of us expected to see so many negroes on the team wayne stated and though we liked playing together it put a lot of pressure on us all the time we had to win because if we lost people wouldnt say kansas got beat they would say the negroes lost again right away they started looking for excuses and reasons for the losses other than that we simply got beat i personally didnt mind playing with a lot of negroes but it left us all open to much abuse especially the racial insults we traveled in the southwest where people had never seen so many negroes on a team we had trouble almost everywhere we played at missouri in that final game they spat on us and called us names so much that we had to fight i couldnt understand those kind of people to me they were like animals thus a sad fact evolved this nonnorthem area apparently objected to a negrodominated team representing them the people would never admit it but perhaps the shock was too great for many of the people who migrated here from southern states cold cash facts indicate that this experiment cost kansas home attendance fell off from the season that year kansas drew an estimated cage fans into allen fieldhouse in with the blackhawks as the chief drawing card it drew only in games by comparison chamberlain as the lone super star had over fans flock to see him play in for a school with the second largest seating capacity in the nation this dropoff was a bitter pill to swallow j the side effects were almost lethal for a state university white athletes freely passed around the suggestion that kansas preps enroll at rival kstate because ku i preferred northern negro talent and that unless they were allamerican they would get no chance to play j when hightower quit it had a j negative effect on several promising negro prospects who declined scholarships figuring that if hightower couldnt make it the school j must be too tough now because of hightowers departure a poor freshman crop two dropouts and graduation kansas is at a point where it could finish in the conference cellar for the first time in its long history kansas learned much from its experience with chamberlain and the blackhawks for it saw firsti hand some of the problems a non northern school can run into especially if its schedule takes it into i a southernthinking area it learned the meaning of the word trouble as the negro athlete has used it for years and how it goes further than the namecalling kansas learned the traditional meaning of trouble which saw its team split on road trips with negro players staying at private homes or nearby negro colleges they saw their negro players rebuffed at restaurants theaters stores and public transportation to combat this coaches joined northern schools in insisting that their players eat and live together even if it meant giving up the plush hotel for a college dormitory but more than anything else kansas coaches became acquainted with the pattern of negro life and learned of a kind of trouble which they couldnt stop but must have some control of in reflecting the kansas situation of last season perhaps this blowup was the thing needed to bring to light something every negro athlete should realize especially those planning to attend the nonnorthern major college or university if present recruiting trends continue the day of the negro superstar is over true there will be negro allamericans and stars in every sport but few can hope to attain the same status of the superstar of old the first negro novelty is wearing off in most areas of the country and the sooner negroes realize this the better like northern areas theyre becoming just another good ball player and should expect to be treated as such chamberlain was a superstar by himself supreme on the floor with things pretty much the way he wanted it hightower was a superstar to the writers and the other coaches to the school and its fans he was just the best of a good group of negro players and that appears to be the fate of any one of several negroes on a team allamerican rating or not for the northernborn negro today who plays at a nonnorthem school he must prepare himself for what is surely to come the namecalling and other racial taunts often done on purpose with the full knowledge that the negro player will explode will continue as long as people find there is a need for them harold hunter head coach of the allnegro tennessee state university which ended the season as the nations no ranked small college team upi poll is a realist along these lines his schedule last season included only four allnegro schools hunter advocated stronger discipline for negro players on white teams as a possible solution you take a boy from a big city where he has been a star and right away he wants to have his own way in stead of doing what he is told coaches nowadays have a way of taking too much off the city boy instead of treating him like any other player the thing that impressed me about oscar robertson at cincinnati was that despite the fact that they gave him almost everything we wanted he still remained a team ball player and followed his coachs advice thats what made him a great college player kansas coach harp along these same lines was firm in what he believed should be the negro athletes goal at kansas we pride ourselves on building leadership and this i think should be the goal of every negro athlete going to college everyone i feel recognizes the ability of our negro athletes our purpose as a university is not to build better athletes but better young men who will lead our country and in their particular case their people a boy should come to college to develop leadership and not just to play basketball or some other sport if he doesnt i think hes missing the entire purpose of his education to the young negro athlete we can only offer this advice pick your schools northern or otherwise with care and with the realization that all that glitters is not gold nonnorthern schools for the negro today are for the most part excellent kansas university the model of most of this article is an excellent nonnorthern school with a fine reputation all nonnorthern schools however have some problems which in the coming years will cease to exist but for now must be at least realized by the prospective athlete one should always remember that at most nonnorthern schools some negro has already paved the way and a close check will probably reveal little ill effects a special kind of courage by alice reid much her graygreen eyes stared steadfastly back at her as she combed out her dark cloud of hair and arranged it decorously behind her shellpink ears and secured the tiny pearl earrings her dress a pale blue cotton with a full skirt and a puritan collar lay on the bed waiting she slipped it on over her neat head carefully and buttoned the little white buttons that marched sturdily up the bodice to look as neat and gentle as possible to meet his parents and his sisters and his brothers she was a birchslim tall girl and the chocolate colored hair belled gloriously about her tender throat he was even taller than she she could wear her new patent heels fright made her hands wet and beaded her upper lip shall they like me she wondered for the millionth time please let them want me he and she sat near each other in psychology ii and a mutual college friend had introduced them from then on they had needed no one listened to no one i only need you he had told her do you want me enough she had pushed back her dark hair and looked up into his clear dark eyes her own eyes wide with the emotion she felt yes she had said to him simply i need you very much it wont be easy he had said but she had merely touched his mouth with her fingers letting her steady eyes say it all for her it was like that with them they regarded one another with tenderness she sat now like a little girl primly careful of her dress on the mourners bench that squatted on the front porch of her college boarding house and waited for him to come as he handed her into the battered waxed and polished little coupe she noted with elation how handsome he looked in his gray flannel suit he had his hair clipped painfully short and he wore a bluish colored necktie and he was nervous she could tell for his manner was taut and he spoke her small name brusquely but he had smiled at her and her heart began to glow the sunday afternoon streets had that lonely subdued sunday look they passed a few humans watering lawns or aimlessly walking she watched the empty streets with interest wondering where all the people went on the long sunday afternoons she could not look at him they were letting the world in today and at this time when they should have been so close seeking solace and strength each from the other she could not even look at him her brother had told her bluntly for you it is a combination of new freedom and suddenly being exposed to all these liberal college groups youll get your balance back most of us do go ahead get it out of your system but dont jump to conclusions too fast and dont you let yourself do anything you cant file away and forget he had been very amused and understanding and tolerant about it after all he had added for emphasis i went through it myself youll actually learn from it if you keep your values intact he had made her quite angry as juliet must have felt when her family disparaged her romeo she had lifted her chin and felt ready to fight hurricanes she had wanted to fly into the worlds prosy face and smack it with her little fist the streets began to change there were stores and cafes and taverns the traffic was heavier he turned down a side street the houses were all tall and ancient gingerbread decorated the dingy gables there were people sitting in the fading sunlight and the shrill screams of playing children he led her up a neat walk up many wooden steps to stand before a wide old door with stained glass windows he opened it and she passed through she smelled food hot heavy food cooking hard there were people here also in this oldfash ioned parlor their dark wary wise eyes chilled her as she went at his side from one to the other smiling unsure and diffident he put her into a big chair and the scene blurred into kaleidoscopic confusion a sister which one sat beside her talking about college his mother brought her a slice of delicious chocolate cake and a cup of steamy lemony tea the mothers eyes were as cold as bits of unburned anthracite though her mouth was sweetly parted in a smile the brothers devoured her with quick glances and shoved each other a little for her benefit j he came to sit alongside her after a bit but his nearness did not help she thought of her mothers cool house of quiet uncluttered rooms of warmth of belonging acceptance of smiling eyes of back grounds and childhoods she remembered the loving arguments that had bored her so terribly but it was a giant step and suppose she was too immature and yet she was in love with him she was wasnt she they did not stay long he pleaded a party that they were to attend and she promised to come back soon and when they stood outside at last she was amazed to see that it was night in the battered waxed and polished coupe she put a hand gently so gently over his clenched fist that clasped the steering wheel and when she looked at him she had her answer we dont have the courage she thought sadly it takes a special kind of courage and the compassionate way that he suddenly took her white hand into his brown one told her all that she needed to know bert williams the modern pagliaccio by walter monfried t he contribution of negroes to american theater and music has been enormous the number of their gifted actors singers dancers bandsmen and entertainers runs into the hundreds until recently however they have not been prominent in the field of comedy but now a group of bright younger men headed by dick gregory of st louis is showing marked ability in that field too gregory a monologist of clever wit and shrewd observation is being called the finest negro comedian since bert williams to couple the name of gregory with that of bert williams is the highest of compliments williams nearly years after his death is ranked among the finest of comedians of any color the funniest man i ever saw the late w c fields said of williams and he added the saddest man i ever knew edward b marks a long time song publisher and sage of show business asserted that no comedian ever surpassed bert in facial expression and pantomime he equaled the greatest of clowns chaplin at his best could hold an audience no better in his slow mournful delivery of a song bert was a raconteur without parallel each song was a mood or an anecdote and you never missed a nuance of feeling master of the single williams tall and handsome was threesixteenths negro and his skin was so light in color that he blackened it for the stage a man of wide reading and cultivated voice he had to speak in the traditional southern drawl expected of a negro entertainer as douglas gilbert the historian of vaudeville points out the printed description hardly provides a faint idea of the williams mastery as a singlethe marvelous face work the expressions of wonder and disdain the vocal drollery the unexpected rises and falls of inflection where im living now is a nice place but you have to go along a road between two graveyards to get to it one of his favorite monologs went one night last week i was coming home kind of late and i got about halfway home when i happened to look over my shoulder and saw a ghost following me i started to run i run till i was most ready to drop and then i looked around but i didnt see no ghost so i sat down on the curbstone to rest then out of the corner of my eye i could see something white and when i turned square around there was that ghost sitting along side of me the ghost says that was a fine run we had it was the best running i ever saw and i says yes and as soon as i get my breath youre going to see some more poker hand classic williams was equally admired for the way he could put over songs including youve got the right church but the wrong pew my castle on the nile not for me the jonah man all goin out and nothin cornin in why dont you get a lady of your own and above all the humorouspathetic nobody delivered deliberately with eloquent pauses i aint never done nothing to nobody iaint never got nothin from nobodyno time anduntil i get somethin from somebody sometime i dontintend to do nothin for nobodyno time his fans never wearied of his silent miming of a poker game alone amid a darkened stage he stood in a spotlight glare only his head shoulders and hands visible holding the cards close to his face he looked eagerly at the draw studied the hand intently placed his bet eagerly looked ever so suspiciously at his fellow sportsmen exulted at the calland relapsed into the losers profound disgust it was rated a classic of vaudevilles happiest era among williams closest friends were ring lardner the gloomy humorist and ashton stevens the chicago stage reviewer lardner and williams were by nature prodigiously untalkative when the former visited the others dressing room they would sit by the hour making a deaf mute seem garrulous by contrast stevens could incite the entertainer to a few more words in his last interview with williams he wrote he was offered a drink this during prohibition and the talk got around to drinking spots the saloon was the only club in which a man of my color could meet a man of your color brother stevens williams related and i like my friends like to be with them id pop my head in a saloon door and not

born in west indies egbert austin bert williams was born on the british west indies island of antigua in his fathers father was a native of denmark the danish consul in antigua and the owner of a plantation on which bert grew up his mother was threefourths spanish and onefourth negro his father in ill health moved with his family to riverside calif williams went to school there and wanted to attend stanford university but lacked funds he read good books all his life however schopenhauer mark twain goethe and many others in boyhood williams showed himself a natural at song and mimicry he could imitate the movements and speech of anyone instead of going to the university he picked up an old banjo and became a minstrel in west coast theaters and honkytonks he teamed up with another talented negro entertainer george walker and the actwhich they worked upranked among the finest in vaudevilles heyday they branched out into legitimate with a musical revue called in dahomey which had a huge success in america and was taken to england where it ran for a year king edward vii was a williams fan and in decreed a command performancethe highest honor any foreign actor could attain in england the king liked to chat with the american off stage later williams shows in which many negroes participated were abyssinia and in bandana land in their matchless dialogs williams played the slow witted drawling fall guy to walkers sophisticated sharpie a typical routine walker i could do this alone but im letting you in on it because youre a friend of mine first of all go into the bank and fill this satchel with money williams whose money walker that aint the point we dont know who put the money there we dont know how they got it and they wont know how we got it all you have to do is fill the satchel williams and what do i do with this satchel walker just bring it to me at a place where i tell you williams when they come to count the cash in the bank and find it short what then walker by that time well be far far awaywhere the birds are singing sweetly and the flowers are in bloom williams after long sober reflection and if they catch us theyll put us so far far away we never will hear no birds singin singin and everybody knows you cant smell no flowers through a stone wall the handsome sociable walker who couldnt resist high life and swift women was mortally stricken with paresis around and williams had to go on alone florenz ziegfeld creator of the perennial follies revues admitted that he had no taste for comedy but he recognized the appeal of williams and starred him in several of his shows from on at first other follies performers threatened to strike if they had to appear with him and williams part of the show was cut to his old time vaudeville single routine but the friendliness and artistry of the newcomer won them over and he was accepted as a full fledged colleagueand by audiences too one evening as williams was going to his dressing room he overheard one actor say to another you have to say this for bert williamshe knows his place thats right williams interrupted genially its that room with the star on the door for nearly a decade williams adorned the follies with vaudeville excursions during off seasons and then went into the famous new york winter garden revues the shubert brothers broadways most powerful showmen created a musical comedy under the bamboo tree especially for williams talents in the early she was the only colored member on tour with it he became ill of pneumonia and returned to his new york home where he died at of the many theater critics who exalted williams heywood broun was especially perceptive he conceded that eddie cantor and a jolson supplied excitement vitality and efficiency but the old bert williams gave you more quiet and consolation he found prosperity and success in the theater but his high talents were largely wasted every round of laughter bound him more securely to his estate as merrymaker booker t washington the famous negro educator and reformer did not share this view bert williams has done more for the race than i have he declared he has smiled his way into peoples hearts i have been obliged to fight my way management cracks industry to meet its ever growing needs for management profession and technical personnel has begun to turn to a previously almost untapped source the plus young negroes who are now graduating each year from college and professional schools corporate recruiters long familiar sights on the campuses of the nations universities and colleges now are becoming frequent visitors to the allnegro institutions the best known of these howard university in washington d c is regularly visited by representatives of some leading companies and most of the some negro colleges and universities now are on corporate calling lists major companies already carrying out negro campus recruiting include bell telephone labs boeing columbia broadcasting system general electric ibm north american aviation union carbide corp and western electric typical of companies which have opened higher level employment to negroes is the burroughs corp where according to industrial relations vice president frank g armstrong negroes now serve as sales and service men computer statisticians engineering draftsmen electrical and mechanical engineering designers field site technicians electronic technicians mathematicians and technical editors armstrong testifying at a detroit hearing of the us commission on civil_rights declared that i am happy and not a little proud to say that our corporate policy of employment and promotion on a nondiscriminatory merit basis has been highly successful but he added that there had been a noticeable lack of negro applicants trained to take up skilled technical and professional positions this lack however is being rapidly overcome negro college enrollment multiplied almost eight times between and while all enrollment increased only a little more than three times and doubled from to while all enrollment increased only a company which fails to hire negroes for jobs for which they are qualified is shortchanging itself according to joseph j morrow vice president personnel relations of pitneybowes inc which employs negroes in high level engineering administrative and sales he says negroes consider themselves permanently on trial no matter how long they are with a company the end result is often distinctly superior in both quality and quantity from a purely selfish standpoint an employer who might be reluctant to hire negroes can assure himself that they are good workers a good investment we wouldnt trade our negro employes for anything paralleling and backstopping the opening up of higher level negro employment by business and industry itself is the federal governments campaign spearheaded by the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities to end all discrimination in industry the committee headed by vice president lyndon johnson and labor secretary arthur goldberg is empowered to publicize names of companies holding government contracts and labor unions which fail to eliminate discriminatory practices and to initiate legal action to terminate contracts and bar new ones with companies refusing to end such practices it expects however to achieve its goals by voluntary agreement the committee recently worked out an agreement with lockheed aircraft corp which outlaws all forms of discrimination and segregation throughout the companys nine divisions and provides for active work in the fields of recruitment employment and upgrading of negroes the agreement was hailed by president kennedy as a milestone in the history of civil_rights the presidents brother attorney general robert kennedy recently asserted that election of a negro to the us presidency could come within the next years selection of a negro as board chairman or president of a major corporation might come even sooner spearheading the movement to open the higher levels of employment to qualified negroes is the national urban league whose commerce and industry council has just held a manpower utilization conference in new york attended by representatives of corporations and universities and colleges general and negro albert f waters vice president of general foods corp who presided at the conference stated that business and industry not only for their own sake but for that of the nation as a whole must institute a program parallel to that being carried on by the federal government to attract qualified young negroes to responsible positions he said our meeting is against a severe backdrop which silhouettes its importance internationally the us is in the midst of a cold war race and we cannot afford to waste any of our human resources describing the conference as the first time in us history that so large a group of corporation representatives and education representatives have convened to consider recruitment of collegetrained negroes on a national basis he added while a number of important companies have extended employment in business relating to training and capacities of negro graduates the vast majority of companies have ignored this source of capable manpower news front to find out just what progress negroes actually have made in attaining executive and professional jobs asked of the nations leading corporations their policy on hiring negroes for such jobs and the number they themselves employed in such capacities most companies because of provisions of the new york state and other antidiscrimination laws were reluctant to place themselves on record but the survey did reveal that the proportion of negroes holding such positions is much higher than generally believed and is mounting the survey also made clear however that almost all such jobs fall into the technical professional and staff categories and that few negroes as yet hold corporate positions with direct line responsibility also indicative is the fact that while in only of all employed negroes held professional technical and similar jobs and only office and clerical jobs in the figures had risen to respectively and how to guard against heart attacks every year in the united states the number of people who have heart attacks increases of the hundreds of thousands who suffer an attack more than percent die in the last year for which national health education committee figures are available a total of persons died from heart attacks and other heart diseases men are the principal victims of heart attacks and other cardiovas cularrenal diseases it is estimated that as many as percent of all fatal heart attacks are suffered by men in the age group between and at least twice as many men as women have heart attacks this means that women are likely to have more heart attacks the older they get before menopause the rate of heart disease among women is relatively low according to medical research the female hormone estrogen provides builtin protection for younger women after menopause when the female hormone subsides women become nearly as susceptible to coronary disorders as men heart attacks arteriosclerosis take a greater toll of human life than any other disease it is a killer against which medical science is mustering formidable opposition however to help reduce the high and spiraling heart attack death rate the public must understand heart disease why so many people suffer from it and what can be done about it to begin with it is necessary to know what a heart attack is and to understand what happens it is necessary to know something of the nature and operation of the heart a heart attack is basically hardening of the arteries around the heart the medical term for this condition is arteriosclerosis of the coronary vessels when fatlike substances in the blood accumulate in the walls of the arteries they tend to clog the arteries and block the flow of blood to the heart muscle this causes what is known as a heart attack the fatty substances in the blood comes from the food consumed and they have the dubious distinction of being the only insoluble elements taken into the body this fat consists of many things cholesterol or fatty alcohol is one of the principal substances ordinary butterfat is another while there are other kinds of heart disease arteriosclerotic heart disease is by far the most dangerous and the most serious form of arteriosclerosis is technically known as atherosclerosis or calcification of the arteries resulting in blood clots hypersensitive heart disease is another frequent heart ailment it is caused by high blood pressure which puts an extra burden on the hearts pumping mechanism eventually this extra pressure impairs the hearts ability to function normally still another frequent heart ailment is rheumatic heart disease this form of heart disease occurs most often to persons with a history of rheumatic fever in childhood rheumatic heart disease affects the heart valves primarily but also involves the joints the term growing pains refers to the aches of rheumatic heart disease angina pectoris is a somewhat less serious heart trouble it is chest pain caused by a lack of sufficient blood supply to part of the heart muscle and it is usually temporary rest is the best remedy for it while angina pectoris is not the same as a heart attack they have in common the narrowing of the arteries the difference is that the artery does not completely close with angina pectoris while medical science knows of no certain means of avoiding heart attacks there are three general rules which doctors say will reduce the likelihood of heart disease these are constant and moderate exercise to keep the muscles toned and the blood fat circulating avoiding excessive physical and emotional strain which might make extra demands on the hearts pumping system and guarding against excess weight and too much fat content in the diet taking the first rule exercise it is important to explode some of the myths about it and heart attacks when former president eisenhower suffered an attack in many people thought that his regular excursions to the golf course may have had something to do with his illness but dr irvine h page president of the american heart association brushed this aside he said that if anything a round or two of golf made one less susceptible to heart attacks coronary heart attacks as far as i know dont seem to be any more common on the golf course or the tennis courts than they are when you sit in your office or are home in bed he said dr paul dudley white eminent heart specialist and president eisenhowers physician at the time issued a statement saying that the presidents heart attack had nothing to do with playing golf on the other hand doctors do not advise undertaking exercise of a strenuous or competitive nature if unaccustomed to it this can both overstimulate the heart muscle and bring on fatigue neither of which is calculated to discourage heart attacks as to the high content of fats in the average american diet many scientists believe this largely accounts for the comparatively greater rate of heart disease among americans a study by dr ansel keys director of minnesotas laboratory of physiological hygiene indicated that the american diet was the fattest containing some percent or more of calories from fats compared to this great britain had only about percent and spain and italy a relatively safe to percent heart ailments are not major health hazards in spain and italy figures from the department of agriculture support the belief that the american heart disease ratio has risen in exact proportion to the fat content of the national diet back in when heart disease was a less critical health problem only about percent of the calories in the nations diet came from fats to cut the high heart disease rate among americans dr keys recommends that the proportion of calories from fats be reduced to between and percent this can be done he says without sacrificing basic nutritional needs however the nature of such a diet should be decided by a qualified physician or nutritionist unfortunately there are no surefire signs to warn of an impending heart attack the electrocardiogram for example which measures the electric impulses that an african student looks at america by babs fafunwa this country to study p i have met over fifty african students during my vacations in exchanging views with them i found that most of our impressions after arriving on the american soil are almost identical everything about him the student finds out mobbed by a group of inquiring reporters who ask what is your name where do you come from what is your impression about america how many wives has your father are you married is it true that you buy women in africa are you a prince is your father a king or a gold miner the shooting of flash bulbs adds to the confusion this barrage is an indication of what the student is to experience as he moves from one part of the united states to another one of my most exciting experiences happened when i arrived in new york city on that day it had one of its greatest snowfalls and whats more i had never seen snow in my life that day my heavy overcoat was no solution to my dilemma as i stepped out of the airplane i was baptized with the unusually biting cold i was shaken to the bones and all my limbs were trembling the woman in me subdued the man and my eyes were shedding tears like an arabian gum tree that night i slept in my overcoat suit and all the temperature was f and the lowest temperature i had ever seen in nigeria is till i landed in new york i had never met an american negro my impression was that since the negro has been living there for the past three hundred years or more he ought to have intermarried with the whites so that his color should be at least lighter than my own by the way i am ebony black and id like to be twice as dark but when i landed i saw a negro darker than myself i thought he was an african who came a little earlier than i did i rushed to him with all the happiness and the joy finding a kinsman in this great metropolis i said hello dear when did you come he looked at me with cold surprise i later found that he must have been here three hundred years for his speech is as entirely strange to me as mine to him the student who hails from the british sphere of influence in africa finds on getting here that americas ideas of democracy are in conflict in a way to those of britains the average englishman admits that a lord jim is his better he does not resent his betters nor put himself on an equal basis with them nor does he wish to do so the american on the other hand rejects all ideas of class everybody is hey or say mister the student finds that democracy works fairly well in the north and otherwise in the south he finds in the north that competition is tough but in the south segregation and discrimination i stare him in the face i remember one day when the african students at bethunecook man college in florida were on their way back to school after giving an african program at a church we stopped at a filling station for some refreshments a policeman entered and said where are you niggers from this particular aspect of our social life has been wilfully misrepresented and we hope our american friends will understand we love our women as passionately as the americans and we are not in the habit of illtreating them or regarding them as chattels the first thing an african student is told is that he should get americanized socialize with the girls forego the english wide trousers for the american narrow pants his little coat for the long heavy coat he finds that table manners in america vary considerably from what he had been used to at home he used fork knife spoon etc while the americans use the fork for everything on the table except soup he therefore has to unlearn what he had learned previously and get adjusted to the american way of life but the pity is that he has to unlearn what he is learning now in order to fit into his own pattern on his return home british way to american way back to british way again while at the same time he has to take care of his culture the african way phone it was a gamble famed rev martin l king jr heralded as the man who controlled the minority vote because of his dixie crusading was lodged in a georgia prison and heads of major organizations were demanding that the presidential candidates intervene if they decided to act they could lose the support of whites in key dixie states both presidential candidates last fall studied the situation assessed the gains and the losses vice president nixon refused to take a position the then sen john f kennedy gingerly called the pregnant wife of the civil_rights hero and expressed his interest in their plight this telephone call late last october some political prognosticators argue decided the close presidential election the reasoning is that the slim margin of victory was due to the heavy vote of negroes in strategic northern and southern states up to that time the usually democratic negro voting mass was complacent unmoved by campaign oratory and lacking the spark even to go in numbers to the polls for want of a dramatic and far sweeping attraction for the negro voter the kennedyking phone relay looms as the single headlined incident of the campaign previously there was little difference between the parties as negroes appraised the records of the candidates and the promises on the matter of the negro in the cabinet issue both party standard bearers neatly dodged the point with grandiose statements that qualifications not race should apply to selection of persons to key posts both parties developed after considerable negotiation strong civil_rights planks at the national convention both parties boasted candidates sensitive to civil_rights and to some degree talkative on the specifics but like the politicians they are they refrained from unduly annoying the white voters below the masondixon line on the m l king episode there was the striking comparison despite his proven ability to draw crowds rev king scrupulously refused to become attached to either party or give out statements backing either candidate both parties however wooed him but the overtures became a nightmare when rev king got in trouble revered by negroes for his civil_rights record vice president nixon for the first time in the campaign revealed a shocking indifference refusing to make a statement or in any way become a participant in the rev king case the vice president even ignored the counsel of cabinet members and his three negro advisors white houser e frederic morrow gop minorities chief val washington and exbaseball star jackie robinson also it was brought out and widely publicized that nixon abandoned speaking engagements in negro sections of northern cities and quietly played down civil_rights as a campaign theme it was a grim revelation to many negroes that the government official who traveled to africa and was photographed shaking the hands of tribal villagers and holding black babies turned down the pleas to help one of their leadersfor political advantage aides later said the vice president hoped to carry some southern states and such an intervention thus would have damaged his election plan as could be expected there was a shift in sentimentaided perhaps by the showering of millions of leaflets in negro sections calling attention to the democratic candidates bold action there was a reevaluation of the candidate whose religion still was his main stumbling block in penetrating the highlyprotestant vote bloc there was an overall appraisal of the two candidates on sincerity and devotion to the cause of civil_rights a matter which previously had been taken for granted even the democrats focused the spotlight on topics of employment health and housing and reporters followed through with articles saying that for the first time negro voters were derailing civil_rights as a key item of consideration the first impact of the kennedy intervention in the king case came in philadelphia where thousands of negroes lined the streets and crowded a housing area to hear the young senator it was the first sign of acceptance by negroes in the campaign but kennedy had some difficulties the mikes broke down later in the week west coast negroes jammed an auditorium to hear kennedy and aides knew then that they had finally struck gold how a telephone call could trigger a national reaction not of jubilance or adulation but more of resentment at being misled confounded top democratic party workers but surprised leaders of the hardworking civil_rights section said one democrat this was like getting a homer in the ninth inning with the score tied few incidents in the campaign received such emphasis few statements or episodes were as widely publicized yet the phone call was no sudden act or a performance done in the heat of crusading almost a score of democratic leaders both negro and white memoed the jfk brass suggesting such a move while others buttonholed every ranking party spokesman behindthescenes there was a maddening flurry of activity which built into a storm and even the presidential candidate couldnt ignore it unknown to many rev king first started the chain of events a week before the historic call king wired kennedy urging a probe of the shooting of harry blake a field secretary for his southern christian leadership conference who was shot a few days earlier while leaving a shreveport la meeting kennedy assigned race relations aide frank reeves to investigate the case reeves then made arrangements to meet king at the airport when reeves arrived at the atlanta airport there was no rev king on the welcoming committee to his surprise reeves learned that king was lodged in jail having been arrested for participating with some youngsters in a sitin at a department store king was detained because of a violation of probation stemming from a traffic case rushing to the jail reeves talked with king and promptly dispatched word of the situation to kennedy advising several channels of action at the same time there were other jfk aides who quickly saw the political advantage of interventionif such a move came before the gop candidate spoke out among those who piloted the project were georgia organizer robert troutman civil_rights staffers harris wofford marjorie lawson louis martin and john seigenthaler a former tennessee newspaperman and aide to robert kennedy wofford got in touch with sargent shriver jfks brotherinlaw reeves spread the word from the candidate to members of his brain trust while most of the others streamed memos to brother robert kennedy with such momentum started it is difficult to ascertain the route of eventual action but one factor is clear the idea was born of no single individual because no one was influential enough to convince kennedy to take such a step as it was his brother robert appeared more daring even calling the atlanta mayor and a judge to air his views and urge consideration however when the presidential candidate called mrs king on wednesday october th the phone call blazed across the negro sections of the nation with as much impact as a mississippi lynching yet jfk made no promises or hinted even of subsequent relief in a later press statement mrs king said it certainly made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt senator kennedy said he was very much concerned about both of us he said this must be hard on me he wanted me to know that he was thinking about us and he would do all he could to help us i told him i appreciated it and hoped he would help i had the feeling that if he was that much concerned he would do what he could so that mr king would be let out of jail she concluded with this bombshell i have heard nothing from the vice president or any one on his staff mr nixon has been very quiet if the wifes statement was not designed for political warfare the words of rev kings father were a prominent atlanta minister the senior rev king who described himself as a lifelong republican was quoted as saying i will carry a basket of votes to kennedy his optimism wasnt fulfilled completely despite his and his sons popularity nixon swept every negro precinct in atlanta with a handsome margin yet gop leader william j shaw conceded that the indifference on the part of the partys high command hurt the gop cause among negroes the same opinion was shared by negro gop leaders in other cities for weeks they quietly reaped a harvest of support by spreading the word that the democrats kept vice presidential nominee lyndon johnson a texan and a conservative in civil_rights out of the big northern cities it was no secret that johnson had little appeal for negroes and once reeves had to advise him to keep his wife from talking too much about her good friend her negro maid but even with this campaign asset the gopers realized that the high command had written off the negro vote for the first time there were no leaflets no newspaper ads in weekly papers no crosscountry campaigning compared to other years in other words said a gop topflighter the king case stuck us in the achilles heel it hurt nixon more than it helped kennedy while political experts attribute such importance to the phone call it is a favorable sign of progress in politics the negro vote certainly has come of age but such a conclusion understandably angers the professional democrats who contend the incident has been stretched out of context said one vip if were so childlike that a phone call can change our minds then publicizing this incident is one way to expand the stereotype that negroes arent intelligent voters theyre emotional mambypambies the controversy probably will rage for years but many americans still will remember the election as one won by a man who gambled on a telephone call by hoyt w fuller and doris e saunders metamorphosis of a poet the year was the young woman was margaret walker and the book was called for my people all the agony and heartbreak and hope and incredible strength that characterizes the negro heritage was there her star glittered zoomed she was a graduate of northwestern seeking an advanced degree at iowa then she went away she was heard from at livingstone college in north carolina and then many remembered the bright promising star and asked where is she she was wanted needed her voice had caught the melody sung by wheatley douglass dunbar cullen hughes kept it fresh true last summer the poet now brisk and matronly paid one of her infrequent visits to chicago she is coordinator of the humanities at jackson state college the mother of four the oldest of which a yearold girl enrolled at western university in oxford ohio in september she seemed a happy womanin mississippialthough there have been no recent poems was the voice still had the star been a mere meteorite flashing across the sky on its way to death in the sea of obscurity said miss walker i am working on a prose project have been for years now it will need at least another years work it was answer enough really for one who is an artist but perhaps a better answer lies in her poetry spelling out the conflict between what she is and where she is in sorrow home she wrote my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee i was sired and weaned in a tropic world warm skies and gulf blue streams are in my blood i belong with the smell of fresh pine with the trail of coon and the spring growth of wild onion the poem ends o southland sorrow home melody beating in my bone and blood how long will the klan of hate the hounds and the chain gangs keep me from my own margaret walker is at home and silent the new black by arna bontemps n literature as in life no doubt dominant traits may be expected to reappear in alternate generations just as children may favor their grandparents more than their parents in ways at least young writers sometimes seem to reach back past their immediate predecessors for examples and blood ties with earlier kin thus the newest crop of negro writers in the united states show more traits in common with the writers of the harlem renaissance than with the famous wpa group who were their literary parents so to speak despite the ringing successes of richard wright frank yerby and willard motley bellweathers of the little flock nourished by wpa writers projects and such gifted colleagues of theirs as roi ottley margaret walker and gwendolyn brooks one searches in vain among the newest negro writers today for any who could qualify as their artistic progeny or even as their disciples well almost in vain lorraine hansberry the exciting author of raisin in the sun is in some very fundamental literary ways related to the sturdy author of native son black boy and uncle toms children even the hansberrywright link however which is by no means limited to the way in which they have drawn upon their common chicago background for subject matter is marked by notable differences miss hansberrys star came up unheralded nothing from her typewriter had been published or produced prior to raisin in the sun the critical and popular approval which followed this event made her famous and the rejoicing this occasioned can only be compared to the kudos which followed richard wrights sunburst a little more than a decade earlier but her recognition was based on a play native son was a novel black boy an autobiography uncle toms children a collection of stories and the two authors though they had both spent crucial years of their lives in the chicago jungle if thats the word for the south side of those days were separated by more than just a span of time in their development richard wrights young manhood in chicago was poverty ridden lorraine hansberrys family was welltodo by south side standards her father was in the real estate business he could in a manner of speaking have owned or managed the rental property in which bigger thomas killed the rat with the frying pan how his perceptive daughter came to see the human turmoil in those substandard quarters through eyes of sympathy and deep understanding has not been told miss hansberrys subsequent writing has consisted mainly of articles in periodicals it has not tended toward autobiography a lesser writer one imagines particularly a lesser negro writer in the united states might have been in a hurry given her talents and background to give the world a picture of debutants balls and gracious living to compensate for the ugliness richard wright had forced before the eyes of millions of readers to the embarrassment of our favored few she also avoided the equally unwise assumption that more of the same material that wright had presented would prove to be equally arresting when presented by her equally instructive but it doesnt work that way without the addition of new elements and the new hansberry ingredient was technique in the theatre a medium that demands a maximum of knowhow usually attained only after long and painful apprenticeship years of heartbreaking trial and error she showed up at first bow with complete control of her tools and her craft this was little short of startling selfeducated richard wright had been a toiling sometimes almost awkward manipulator of the devices of composition he had won over this disadvantage by sheer power in lorraine hansberrys case this particular shoe seemed to be on the other foot which of course is as it should be one looks for an increase of technical skills in a second or third generation of writers if any loss in originality or other qualities occurs one expects it to be balanced by greater familiarity with the mechanics thanks to the examples and experiments of the forerunners if this is not a generalization that can be applied to all of the newest crop of negro writers it should be allowances can no longer be made for technical weakness but more striking parallels or kinships as i have ventured appear when the work of the newest negro writers is put beside the product of the ardent young people who came to harlem in the early twenties and created the upsurge of creativity known as the harlem renaissance this was the group that drew from charles s johnson the cautious and careful sociologist the rare exclamation that a brief ten years have developed more confident selfexpression more widespread efforts in the direction of art by negroes in the u s than the long dreary two centuries before in the constellation to which johnson referred jean toomer was the first star his place and influence among the new negroes of the harlem group were like those of ralph ellison today when published by such little magazines as dial broom little review and doubledealer toomers stories and sketches poems and plays delighted the avant garde symbolism with varying levels of psychological and philosophical meaning fascinated him yet his heart belonged to the folk negro charles s johnson thought at first he detected a certain remote link between toomers compositions and the writing of paul laurence dunbar where dunbar gave to the unnamed negro peasant a reassuring touch of humanity toomer gave to the peasant a passionate charm he observed his conclusion was however that toomer was more than an artist he was an experimentalist obviously much of this comment could as well be applied to the talented author of invisible man as to the handsome young wanderer whose cane was a literary sensation in but who soon after turned his back on greatness ellison has not turned his back but he is a slow and painstaking worker invisible man was many years in the writing like cane however it was promptly recognized as a landmark drawing heavily on folk sources reflecting its authors preoccupation with technique and the roots of artistic expression invisible mans critical reception amounted to acclaim it was accepted as a major work a consensus roughly equivalent to that which greeted cane thirty years earlier while one is clearly a novel the other hard to classify by form side by side the two books make a fascinating study a conversation between the two extremely articulate authors should it ever occur would be worth going many miles to overhear invisible man was a bestseller in the year in which it was published it was given the national book award in marking a first in recognition of this type for a negro writer in the united states while it did not reach so wide an audience as richard wright had reached in the forties the reading public was much better prepared for it than it had been for cane only a few hundred copies of which were sold if neither ellison nor toomer became rich as a direct result of these important and significant books both immediately found themselves in demand in circles where the meaning of things are explored both awakened to find that their wellchosen words had suddenly become gospel to a goodly company of inquirers and both entered into secondary careers as occasional essayists discussants and instructors both ellison and toomer reached literature after an initial interest in music both have shown a probing interest in the common sources of creative expression even in their personal lives certain parallels may be detected but there are also significant differences and these may account for the crucial decision each eventually made ellison to write invisible man toomer to become invisible an authors looks have little if anything to do with his writing but some people who have known them both have not failed to observe that james baldwin is the spitnimage of wallace thurman when baldwin speaks and especially when he laughs the resemblance becomes so striking it almost makes one wonder about incarnation thurmans early death in the fading days of the harlem renaissance was one of two quick tragedies by which some of the participants have dated the passing of that period in the last five years of his life however thurman saw experienced and wrote a great deal he was no exception indeed he was conspicuous for it in a group that believed that poetry and prose were things you might live as well as write this was a part of the harlem renaissance that may not have survivedor been resurrected thurman was fond of the first sentence of rafael sabatinis scaramouch he was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad he thought it applied to himself on the whole however his taste in novels ran to dostoevsky proust sherwood anderson and theodore dreiser especially the latter he made them his examples in another period perhaps he might have become a brilliant stylist like baldwin but in the twenties he tried to avoid polished prose he made a point of writing very fast and changing very little in the hope of achieving a kind of roughshod power something like that of dreiser he said there may have been another reason consciously or unconsciously he may have felt that for him time was limited he died of tuberculosis and there may have been prior indications but before he was finally stricken he published the blacker the berry as well as two lesser novels wrote much for the magazines saw his play harlem produced on broadway did bales of writing for mass media including movies and worked for a popular publisher as a sort of handyman in thurmans reflections on literature growing out of wide and attentive reading something like the baldwin sharpness was expressed reading an article by james baldwin in the new york times magazine or harpers today one who knew and read thurman will find himself stopped now and then realizing that here thurman would have warmly concurred in the greater seriousness of james baldwin however in the vast distance between the goals the two set for themselves as writers there is more to contrast than to compare where baldwin and the renaissance writer he most nearly resembles are concerned to what extent this difference of stance indeed difference of outlook reflects the diminishing of some forms of the resistance met by negro writers in the past is an open question but certainly no essayist of the twenties showed comparable power no prose writer of that era except toomer had his precision and style none was more exciting there are some indications that the personal histories of baldwin and thurman might have a good bit in common without resorting to speculation baldwin makes no secret of the blood and tears so to speak that have already gone into the forging of his talent the two novels that have resulted thus far include one that was widely praised and one that was widely read go tell it on the mountain garnered most of the praise giovannis room a good many more readers one gathers his notes of a native son however appears to have been more influential than either giving rise to a lively debate between those who esteem baldwin more for his essays than his fiction and those who would put it the other way round his nobody knows my name is a current sensation in any case a group of younger writers which starts with two such figures as ellison and baldwin need not fear that it will be ignored or fail to receive serious attention its constituents have only to establish that they belong on the roster louis e lomax whose essays have been appearing in harpers magazine and elsewhere recently whose book the reluctant african won the anisfield wolf award this year certainly qualifies interestingly his work has more than a little in common with that of walter white of the twenties as a writer except that lomax has published no fiction yet some critics have been mean enough to suggest that it might have been better if white hadnt either but put whites contributions to the century and other periodicalsof that decadebeside lomax of todays bracket rope and faggot with the reluctant african and you get a pair you might call them the georgia boys the young walter white made use of the excellent perspective of the lightskinned negro writer passing for white to get inside lynch mobs and make his report something beyond journalism seemed to result not favored by this special circumstance lomax has benefited from another that was not available to a writer of his type in the twenties television foremost among the writers of the present crop who have chosen journalism as their medium however is carl t rowan of the minneapolis tribune winner of three successive sigma delta chi newspaper awards together with its coveted medallion in author of south of freedom the pitiful and the proud go south to sorrow and coauthor with jackie robinson of wait till next year rowan has been a frequent contributor to look the saturday evening post and other magazines of the widest circulation more recently he has been rewarded with an appointment as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs journalistically at least rowan is one from the ranks of the newest negro writers who may be said to glitter when he walks no member of the renaissance group enjoyed the same kind or even comparable success it is possible however to see in the short stories of alston anderson as collected in the volume lover man a poignant reminder of the now almost forgotten short fiction of eric d waldron whose tropic death pleased the critics in the harlem period and made its authors career one to watch in those days there are those who are still waiting for more waldron who refuse to believe that the talent that created these authentic and throbbing tales more than thirty years ago could have ever stopped creating given normal health they keep expecting something he may have written and stashed away to come to light none of which is to say of course that the mentioning of anderson in the same breath with waldron suggests any likeness whatever in their personalities or in their writing careers apart from the single volumes of short stories by which each is principally known however there is another point both these writers have the west indies and panama in their backgrounds the harlem flavor captured by julian mayfield in his novels the hit the long night and the grand parade is very close to that which inspired rudolph fishers short stories and novels in the twenties like fisher too mayfield is a man of many talents he was an actor in a leading role in lost in the stars and he has had a play produced offbroadway while he has done more with the novel less with the shorter fiction than did fisher the similarities the reminders are definitely there and if the harlem renaissance group had no lorraine hansberry and no carl t rowan neither have the present group of negroes writers poets comparable to claude mckay countee cullen and langston hughes it remains to be seen whether paule marshall can replace the gifted zora neale hurston the harlem group also included helene johnson dorothy west frank horne sterling brown nella larson and the two fausets jessie r and arthur huff of course the present lot can point to good material among their reserves frank london brown le roi jones gloria oden john o killens herbert simmons melvin kelley are definitely coming on but it will take the best by all of these to fill the firmament as did the literary stars that brightened the harlem sky in the twenties means to me by hazel scott hree years in paris t rehabilitated me i went there originally for three weeks to rest and play an engagement before i left america unknown to anyone adam and i had a little talk i was not too happy with the work situation here and i was not happy personally adam said if youre not happy here why dont you stay over there a while and work the three weeks stretched out to three years they were for the most part gay funfilled workfilled years after a year skipper my son joined me we took a large apartment in paris which we still have and occasionally we went down to cannes to live with friends on the riviera during this period i entertained at clubs all over the continent and in north africa and the near east my three years out of america were three years of much needed rest not from work but from racial tension and by that i do not mean that i never run into racism that would not be true but whenever i encountered racism in any form it was so rare that it was an exception rather than the rule and it stuck out as an incident im not going to say that france is paradise but i will say this you can live anywhere if youve got the money to live you can go anywhere if youve got the money to go and whomever you marry or date is your business since my return to america i have been attacked by some uninformed people who say i ran away from the problem in one new york hotel where i was staying the room service waiter said i once thought you were the greatest but you have fallen in my estimation because you left america where the fight is well im here to tell you that roughly per cent of the armed service personnel overseas are southerners people who have never been exposed to racist thinking are being told what the southern white man thinks of the negro the fight is not confined to america it is worldwide a friend told me upon billie holidays return to the united states she called me the queen of the mau maus she meant this as a compliment she said it because of the affection and esteem the african students of paris hold for me i appeared in two french movies with some of the top french stars i also signed to play the lead in a french version of anna lucasta but a legal hassle over rights to the play prevented the producer from staging it between engagements i relaxed and absorbed the healthy restful atmosphere of paris my paris is not the city of champagne and caviar my paris is a pot full of red beans and rice and an apartment full of old friends and glasses tinkling and the rich happy sound of people laughing from the heart my paris is the warmth of the big thanksgiving dinners i had every year for my old and dear friends my paris is the enchantment of wandering through an old museum hand in hand with an old friend from hollywood lost in the wonder of rodin my paris is the magic of looking up the champs elysees from the place de la concorde and being warmed by the merry madness of the lights my paris is like the very first time you realize youre in love like the very first time youre kissed paris is all this and more but it is also pain while i was there some of my dearest friends died and some were murdered i lost lester young and billie holiday and i went to the very door of death myself after a serious operation lester who is not was such a beautiful individual came to see me every day during my recuperation and we listened for hours on end to frank sinatras album only the lonely it pains me to remember that he went from my apartment to an airplane which took him to america and death paris is billie holiday too i remember her one night toward the end singing a bitter blues trying to say everything trying to explain everything within the confines of twelve bars she had been robbed again and she was blue sitting there in the mars club in paris listening to this woman who represents not represented so many years of my life sitting there remembering how she used to protect me and curse me and run me home when i was and working on nd street in new york i was overcome by all the tragedy all the greatness and all the beauty of her life i had my own problems too anna lucasta had just collapsed and i was sort of inbetween and wandering while wondering where i was going and what i was doing i began to cry billie stopped gripped my arm and dragged me to a back room and slammed the door the next time you begin to feel like this she said just remember that youve got skipper and lady only has a little chihuahua and ladys making it and another thing never let them see you cry isnt that a wonderful fantastic thing to say never let them see you cry i learned a lot in paris about people and about myself one does not look into the face of death as i have and come away worrying about pettiness and cattiness and gossip and conforming it seems that everytime i am near death someone or something is asking me over and over how stupid can you get how many changes will you need before you find out whats important this last time when i spent a month or so in bed i got the message i am not likely ever to forget it love is important love some people go to their graves without ever learning that very simple lesson negro officials after the civil war by dr john hope franklin the act of march was specific about the qualifications of those who were to have a voice in the new program of reconstruction constitutions were to be written by delegates to be elected by the male citizens of the state twentyone years old and upward of whatever race color or previous condition who have been resident in said state for one year except such as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony at common law it was no easy task to administer satisfactorily these provisions of the act the commanding generals in the southern military districts were hard pressed to find competent and qualified registrars to enroll the electorate they used union army officers and freedmens bureau agents and a few of them used some negroes travel into remote areas was difficult and in some instances weeks elapsed before registrations were received compiled and made ready for elections some of the commanding generals felt a deep responsibility to provide a little political education for those voters who had never had the experience or the opportunity to participate in politics several of them gave explicit instructions to registration officials to provide the freedmen with adequate information regarding their political rights freedmens bureau officers and agents engaged by the generals to work in the registration program helped the new voters understand their rights and duties when bureau officials had no political literature of their own to distribute they disseminated materials prepared by the union league which was as we shall see easily the most active organization in the political education of the negro when the criteria for becoming electors were applied to the people of the south three groups qualified one group was the vast majority of negroes whose loyalty to the union was unquestioned and who merely had to prove that they were not felons and had lived in the state one year another was the northerners who had taken up residence in the south if they met the residence requirements they were enrolled finally there were the native southerners who qualified to take the ironclad oath and who were scrutinized with the greatest care the rank and file among these groups was to be the center of the controversy that raged over the ensuing decade out of these groups were to come the leaders who bore the majority responsibility for both the good and the evils flowing from the difficult task of rebuilding the south the entrance of negroes into the political arena was the most revolutionary aspect of the reconstruction program out of a population of approximately four million some qualified as voters but the most of them were without the qualifications to participate effectively in a democracy in this they were not unlike the large number of americans who were enfranchised during the age of jackson or the large number of immigrants who were being voted in herds by political bosses in new york boston and other american cities at this time they were the first to admit their deficiencies beverly nash an unlettered former slave sitting in the south carolina convention expressed the views of many when he said i believe my friends and fellowcitizens we are not prepared for this suffrage but we can learn give a man tools and let him commence to use them and in time he will learn a trade so it is with voting we may not understand it at the start but in time we shall learn to do our duty like nash most of the negroes were illiterate a slave existence could hardly be expected to prepare one for the responsibilities of citizenship especially when there were laws as there were in all slave states banning the teaching of slaves even if negroes were free as were more than in the slave states before the war laws forbade their being taught to read and write indeed when they came out of slavery many negroes did not know their own names many did not even have family names it goes without saying that a considerable number had not the vaguest notion of what registering and voting meant none of this is surprising it had been only two years since emancipation from a system that for more than two centuries had denied slaves most rights as human beings and it must be remembered that in these two years the former confederates in power all over the south did nothing to promote the social and political education of the former slaves what is surprising is that there were someand no paltry numberwho in were able to assume the responsibilities of citizens and leaders among south carolinas negro leaders was state treasurer francis l cardozo educated at glasgow and london who had been a minister in new haven and after the war was principal of a negro school in charleston robert b elliott born in massachusetts trained at eton college in england and elected to congress in was urbane and articulate j j wright a state supreme court justice had studied at the university of pennsylvania and had been a respected member of the pennsylvania bar before moving to south carolina after the war congressman james rapiers white father sent him to school in canada and when he returned to his native alabama after the war he had not only an ample formal education but a world of experience gained from travel and work in the north floridas secretary of state jonathan c gibbs graduated from dartmouth college and had been a presbyterian minister for several years when reconstruction began among the negro leaders of north carolina james w hood assistant superintendent of public instruction and james h harris an important figure in the constitutional convention were educated respectively in pennsylvania and ohio many others among them henry m turner of the georgia legislature hiram revels united states senator from mississippi and richard h gleaves member of congress from south carolina had much more than the rudiments of a formal education when they entered upon their official duties significant among negro leaders were those who were almost wholly selfeducated robert smalls of south carolina pursued his studies diligently until he had mastered the rudiments later he went to the united states house of representatives in mississippi john roy lynch regularly took time off from his duties in a photographers studio to gaze across the alley into a white schoolroom where he kept up with the class until he had mastered the courses taught there when he became speaker of the mississippi house and later a member of congress he relied on this earlier training before jefferson long went into congress from georgia he had educated himself and had become a merchant tailor in macon there were numerous other selfeducated negro leaders including john carraway and peyton finley of alabama james ohara and a h galloway of north carolina and james w bland and lewis lindsay of virginia from this educated element came the articulate responsible negroes who contributed substantially to the writing of the new constitutions and the establishment of the new governments in the former slave states most of the negro leaders were ministers a fair number taught school some were employees of the freedmens bureau or another federal agency here and there one found a negro who had been trained in the law there were of course farmers and there were some artisans engaged in a variety of occupations the economic interests and aspirations of the negro leaders varied widely it would be wrong to assume that they had no economic interests or that they had no views regarding the economic future of the south one of the really remarkable features of the negro leadership was the small amount of vindictiveness in their words and their actions there was no bully no swagger as they took their places in the state and federal governments traditionally occupied by the white planters of the south the spirit of conciliation pervaded most of the public utterances the negroes made in his first speech in the south carolina convention beverly nash asserted that the southern white man was the true friend of the black man pointing to the banner containing the words united we stand divided we fall nash said if you could see the scroll of the society that banner represents you would see the white man and the black man standing with their arms locked together as the type of friendship and union which we desire negroes generally wished to see political disabilities removed from the whites in south carolina several negroes presented a resolution asking congress to remove all such disabilities and it was passed in louisiana the negroes requested that former confederates be permitted to vote but for the time being not to hold office in alabama james t rapier a negro delegate to the constitutional convention successfully sponsored a resolution asking congress to remove the political disabilities of those who might aid in reconstruction in mississippi a democratic paper the jackson clarion admitted that in their general conduct negroes have shown consideration for the feelings of the whites in other words the colored people had manifested no disposition to rule or dominate the whites and the only color line which had existed grew out of the unwise policy which had previously been pursued by the democratic party in its efforts to prevent the enjoyment by the newlyemancipated race of the rights and privileges to which they were entitled under the constitution and laws of the country in south carolina beverly nash declared that in public affairs we must unite with our white fellowcitizens they tell us that they have been disfranchised yet we tell the north that we shall never let the halls of congress be silent until we remove that disability negroes attempted no revolution in the social relations of the races in the south francis b simkins in his new viewpoints of southern reconstruction has accurately observed that the defiance of the traditional caste division occasionally expressed in an official reception or in an act of the legislature was not reflected generally in common social relations negroes as a rule conceded to the insistence of whites that they were a race apart and they made little or no attempt to invade social privacies they did not even attempt to destroy white supremacy except where such supremacy rejected negroes altogether as human beings and there was almost nowhere any serious consideration given to providing legal approbation of interracial marriages while negroes sought equality as human beings they manifested no desire to involve themselves in the purely social relations of whites as individuals or as groups it is false it is a wholesale falsehood to say that we wish to force ourselves upon white people declared the nearwhite p b s pinchback of louisiana nor did any considerable number of negroes seek to effect an economic revolution in the south henry mcneal turner the fearless negro leader who was almost universally disliked by white georgians did what he could to assist the whites in recovering their economic strength in the georgia convention he secured the passage of two resolutions that indicated a remarkable willingness to stabilize the economic life of the white community one sought to prevent the sale of property whose owners were unable to pay their taxes the other provided for the relief of banks in south carolina negro leaders such as robert delarge and francis cardozo supported relief measures with the full knowledge that whites would benefit as much as negroes the movement of northerners into the south after the civil war is a part of the exciting drama of the migrations that had seen the continent populated from ocean to ocean and had taken americans new and old wherever opportunity beckoned the movement into the south was greatly stimulated by the favorable observations of scores of thousands of union soldiers who had seen action on southern battlefields some were mustered out of the army while still in the south and despite some southern feelings of hostility against them decided to adopt the south as their home others back in their northern homes waited only for the first opportunity to return to the south by the fall of for example more than five thousand union soldiers had settled in louisiana alone the movement was also stimulated by the large number of industrialists and investors who saw in the underdeveloped south an important new economic frontier those committed to the view that the souths recovery from the war would be accompanied by an era of unparalleled expansion began to move into the region bringing with them their own resources and often the resources of others with which to build railroads and factories and to purchase farm land and other properties many federal agentssome from the department of the treasury others from the freedmens bureausettled in the south and called it home northern teachers men and women braved numerous indignities at the hands of hostile whites in order to teach negroes and they cast their lot with the south there were those from the north moreover who saw new political opportunities in the south they hoped to use the newly enfranchised element and the problems arising out of reconstruction to achieve political power and economic gain for them the south was a happy hunting ground that they could not resist as to any frontier there went to the south the adventurers those who wanted to get rich quick and neerdowells who were fully prepared to embrace any cause including radical reconstruction that would benefit them these were the people who have been called carpetbaggers for the last ninety years this opprobrious term used as early as to describe any suspicious stranger was applied indiscriminately to all northerners in the south during reconstruction it has generally implied that as a group they had nothing in the way of worldly possessions and were thoroughly unprincipled in their determination to fleece and exploit the south until their carpetbags fairly bulged with the possessions of southerners and they were forced to acquire new coffers in which to place their illgotten gains they have been described as a group at work on a grand master plan to africanize the country one historian described them as gangs of itinerant adventurers vagrant interlopers who were too depraved dissolute dishonest and degraded to get the lowest of places in the states they had just left these descriptions fall far short of the mark they impugn the integrity and good intentions of thousands whose motives were otherwise even more important perhaps is the fact that such descriptions show no understanding of the variety and complexity of the motives underlying the migrations and no appreciation for the economic and political relationships that grew out of such motives there is no evidence that even the considerable number of negro migrants from the north were interested in africanizing the country indeed the term was an extravagance a flourishlike negro rule used to express disgust the other common descriptions are equally inaccurate as thomas conway pointed out a few months after the war many northerners including the teacher preacher merchant husbandman mechanic laborer and discharged union soldier were ready to move south he had persuaded northern men to take into the south to purchase land make loans and advances on crops their only fears were whether there was sufficient law and order to maintain security for their investments but they went south and they continued to go all during the reconstruction period in november sidney andrews observed that already several massachusetts men were in business in charleston and he estimated that at least half the stores on the principal streets of the city were run by northern men the careers of captain h s chamberlain and general john t wilder both of ohio illustrate the kind of activities in which numerous socalled carpetbaggers were engaged when chamberlain was mustered out of the union army in knoxville tennessee in he at once entered the iron and coal business in knoxville and is regarded by some as the real founder of the modern iron industry south of the ohio in chamberlain joined with general wilder later of wilders lightning brigade of ohio to organize the roane iron company which bought large tracts of coal and iron land and engaged extensively in the operation of coke works iron mines and furnaces together they became involved in many industrial and financial ventures including the dixie portland cement company the brookside cotton mills of knoxville and the first national bank of chattanooga that all socalled carpetbaggers were not simply radicals with no consideration for the welfare and development of the south can be seen also in the life of willard warner planter politician and iron manufacturer born in granville ohio and educated at marietta college warner served in the union army and went to the ohio senate in two years later he moved to alabama and with his ample resources engaged in cotton planting for several years he became active in republican politics and served in the united states senate from to then he organized the tecumseh iron company and served as president and manager until for this venture more than was supplied by his northern associates later he moved to tennessee where he had extensive investments and blast furnaces the overthrow of reconstruction seems not to have affected this carpetbagger for as late as the conservatives the democrats in his adopted state elected him to the tennessee legislature if recent historians have reviled northerners who settled in the south after the civil war their southern contemporaries were inclined to be grateful to them for their contributions to southern development clinton a cilley born in new hampshire and a harvard graduate settled in north carolina in after a career in law including several years as a judge of the lenoir superior court he was called in one of north carolinas ablest lawyers and finest citizens general wilder the iron manufacturer was very popular among southerners including former confederates during the spanishamerican war the governor of tennessee named the training camp near knoxville camp wilder in honor of the carpetbagger from ohio lieutenant b h true of the th new york volunteers who settled in georgia in was consistently popular with his new neighbors they not only supported his newspaper the appeal and advertiser but elected him as the celebrated farmer from morgan county to the state agricultural society the interest of such men and groups of men in the political future of the south was real with so much at stake in the way of investments and with full appreciation of the economic potential of the south they could not be indifferent to the uncertain political winds that were blowing across their adopted home their interest transformed itself into a strong desire to attain certain specific political goals for the south one was the achievement and maintenance of law and order they had seen enough hostility and lawlessness in many southern communities to cause considerable uneasiness about the safety of their investments they wanted governments that would insure this safety and if they could facilitate the establishment of such governments they would certainly do so another was the maintenance of a close alliance between government and the business community they had seen the importance of such an alliance in numerous developments in washington during the war and in the effective service that several state governments in the north had rendered the business community favorable banking and insurance laws tax exemptions or rebates land grants and other assistance to railroads were among the favors the government could and would under certain desirable circumstances grant to business and industry if at all possible northerners would see that this was done in the south finally most northerners in the south were convinced that their goals could best be attained through a vigorous wellorganized republican party throughout the south this was after all the party responsible for the intimate relationship between government and business on the national level and in several northern state governments they knew that there was little chance of luring the former confederates into the republican party and that the democratic party would oppose at every turn whatever republicans attempted to do southern democrats tended to equate republicans with abolitionists and thus to regard them as the destroyers of the souths cherished economic and social system northern republicans had to look to others in the south for political support a republican in the south did not have to belong to the thaddeus stevenscharles sumner wing of the party to reach the conclusion that negro suffrage was not only desirable but imperative for the conclusion was inescapable that the partys strength would come from negroes and from whatever support they could secure from loyal native southerners they did all they could to promote the enfranchisement of the negro and draw him into the republican party this did not mean however that the socalled carpetbaggers were interested in africanizing the south even when they undertook to northernize the south there was no revolution in the general social relations between negroes and whites b h true a new yorker living in georgia said that he was as friendly toward the negro as anyone but there is an antagonism which we all have against the race that i cannot get rid of i do not believe any man can had these radicals been radical on social questions they would have opposed the laws against intermarriage that were enacted during the radical regime they would also have stood for one system of public schools open to all races but their infrequent expressions in favor of such a system were feeble indeed these matters unlike negro suffragewere not among their primary interests and they gave them scant attention it was only natural that northerners in the south could wield political influence and exercise power far out of proportion to their numbers they were the best prepared to step into the vacuum created by the disfranchisement of the former confederates they had training and experience in political and economic matters that neither negroes nor loyal native southerners had they clearly knew what their interests were and how best they could be secured finally they had the support of the powerful victorious party that was in control of affairs in washington while their influence in the south was not always decisive or even critical it was invariably a factor in the determination of affairs present and future in the southern states no group of postwar southern leaders has been reviled or castigated or misunderstoodmore than loyal native southerners commonly known as scalawags the term came in all likelihood from scalloway a district in the shetland islands where small runty cattle and horses were bred it was used in western new york before the civil war in referring to a mean fellow a scape grace in the south the term was used by the opponents of reconstruction to describe those they regarded as the lowest meanest element in society these were the southerners who could swear that they had never voluntarily given aid countenance counsel or encouragement to persons in rebellion and had exercised or attempted to exercise the functions of no office under the confederacy they were largely men who had opposed secession the votes against secession in some state legislatures together with the known sentiment against such drastic action indicates that a considerable number of southerners dragged their feet or refused to have any part in the confederate cause many had for years smarted under a system that gave every advantage to the planter class to which very few of them belonged they bitterly resented the course of action pursued by the planter class which had led to a war that from their point of view became more and more a poor mans fight it is impossible to determine how many socalled scalawags were qualified to participate in reconstruction under the terms of the several acts of congress likewise it is impossible to determine the extent to which those who took the ironclad oath were eligible to do so after june those who took the oath were as president johnson had indicated to the commanding generals judges of their own honesty since the machinery as well as the personnel of registration was of questionable efficiency it is entirely possible that many who were clearly not eligible registered anyway there were some eligibles who refused to register and many who were not eligible advised the loyal southerners to have no part in the radical regime others advised the eligibles to register and then defeat the radical effort by voting against it if we are to wear manacles said governor perry of south carolina let them be put on by our tyrants not ourselves but there were those in the south who counseled loyal southerners to participate in the new reconstruction program and then to restrain any excessive or revolutionary tendencies that might militate against the best interests of the south the fact that negroes were to participate did not degrade white southerners or diminish their influence unless they purposely abandoned the field to negroes the new orleans picayune told its readers that promptness in registering and voting would convince the north that we mean to take care of our own affairs the savannah news gave similar advice when it declared that georgia expected every man to do his duty and register without delay to show his reverence for his noble commonwealth the charleston daily courier echoed the same view that you should register is an imperative duty which each man owes to himself to his community and to his state a curious assortment of native southerners thus became eligible to participate in radical reconstruction and the number increased as the president granted individual pardons or issued new proclamations of amnesty it became increasingly difficult to make a distinction between the views of the loyal southerners and the views of those whose citizenship was being restored on political and social questions they ranged from the radicalism of james w hunnicut of virginia who stood for the full legal and social equality of negroes and whites to the conservatism of milton candler a georgia senator who claimed that negroes were not citizens and therefore were not eligible to hold office certainly the majority of these loyal southerners could not be described as radicals in the sense of embracing the policies and program for negroes set forth by the radicals in congress often they advocated segregation of negroes and whites in educational and other institutions often they spoke as vigorously for the rights of the south as did any former confederate their primary interest was in supporting a party that would build the south on a broader base than the plantation aristocracy of antebellum days they found it expedient to do business with negroes and socalled carpetbaggers but often they returned to the democratic party as it gained sufficient strength to be a factor in southern politics these were the people who were called scalawags by their adversaries they hardly deserved the name nor did they deserve the numerous other opprobrious labels pinned on them by hostile critics wade hampton called them the mean lousy and filthy kind that are not fit for butchers or dogs another called them scaly scabby runts in a herd of cattle even the historians have joined in the verbal assault on these loyal native southerners one describes scalawags as vile blatant vindicative unprincipled perhaps during the period of their ascendancy the scalawags committed many offenses against the social order for the graft and corruption they must take at least a part of the blame but their most serious offense was to have been loyal to the union during the civil war or to have declared that they had been loyal and thereby to have enjoyed full citizenship during the period of radical reconstruction it is extremely difficult to determine the strength of the three groups that dominated the south during radical reconstruction there was constant fluctuation in the show of strength particularly among the native southerners and the northerners living in the south and there was constant defection with negroes dropping out of the picture under ku klux klan or other pressures with northerners leaving or going over to the conservatives as the opponents of radical reconstruction were called and with loyal southerners deviating from or deserting the radical cause altogether the best that one can do is look at the comparative numerical strength of the three groups and draw some inferences from the observation a likely time for such a comparison is when the several state conventions wrote the new constitutions required by the reconstruction acts the figures illustrate several significant points in the first place except for south carolina negroes enjoyed no numerical domination in the conventions the only other state in which they were nearly a majority was louisiana where by agreement they were to constitute per cent of the delegates thus negro rule as reconstruction has been erroneously described had an inauspicious beginning and indeed was never to materialize second the socalled carpetbaggers were in the minority in every state except mississippi many were so preoccupied with personal undertakings or with setting up schools and churches that they had no time for public service their position however was adequately represented by those new settlers who did find time to serve finally the native whites had a larger numerical representation in the conventions than is usually recognized dominating several conventions such as those in alabama georgia and north carolina and having substantial numbers in others they were prepared to play a significant part in the deliberations and in the administration of affairs in their states although leadership in the south came from these three groups at least in the early days of congressional reconstruction it does not follow that the leaders invariably worked together in promoting a radical program their motives values and goals were not the same and their effort to work together was often strained because of these differences far from entering into any conspiracy to degrade and destroy the southern way of life they frequently worked at cross purposes at times the position of the negro leaders approached that of the crusading abolitionists meanwhile the socalled carpetbaggers frequently preoccupied themselves with building up the alliance between the business community and the republicancontrolled state government all too often moreover the loyal southerners talked and acted like the conservative former confederates whom they presumably opposed cooperation was at best loose and irregular forced at times only by the threat of their common destruction it was under these circumstances that the three groups of leaders forged a program for the reconstruction of the southern states how such a program actually emerged is one of the fascinating chapters in american history the by duke ellington which way is jazz going questions of this kind are never easy to answer and in this case it might be easier to answer another question namely where is jazz coming from because one of the most important distinctions between the musical scenes of yesterday and today is that the average young musician nowadays comes equipped with conservatory experience with a background of educational equipment that is way out ahead of the training most of the musicians had not too many years ago as far as the future of jazz is concerned it is by no means certain that this will be the only factor in determining which way things will go whether jazz will be more folklike in nature or less whether it will be less or more mechanical is not important what is important is that it must live and the only way it can live is with the existence of an ever larger and more keenly interested audience to give it the support that must always be its life blood jazz like any other form of art has to be subsidized if there are more intelligent listeners of course it will move in a more intelligent direction this does not necessarily mean however that it will leave the realm of folk music and tend to move into a more mecanique type of thing recently i was asked whether i felt that jazz had moved a great distance away from its folk origins with the present state of rockandroll music i dont know how anyone can even consider asking such a question rockandroll is the most raucous form of jazz beyond a doubt it maintains a link with the folk origins and i believe that no other form of jazz has ever been accepted so enthusiastically by so many this is probably an easy medium of musical semantics for the people to assimilate im not trying to imply by this that rockandroll shows any single trend or indicates the only direction in which things are moving it is simply one aspect out of many i have written a number of rockandroll things myself but am saving them for possible use in a show as far as my own music in general is concerned i would categorize it as negro music it represents what i absorbed as a child and have grown up with among the people around me who were musicians and beyond that my own self and my surroundings have been injected into it there have been many rebellions concerning our music through the years as far back as when i said i was playing negro music some critics complained sophisticated lady is not negro music but the fact remains that sophisticated lady is negro musicits the negro i know and my interpretation no matter how many controversies may rage about the direction in which our music or jazz in general is going the music will continue to develop along natural lines some of it may become more complex and some of it will remain simple there will always be some kind of folk music around be it rockandroll or western or hillbilly music actually the word simple is sometimes misleading and is subject to many interpretations take for instance a recent composition entitled night creature we gave this number its premiere at carnegie hall performed by our orchestra combined with the symphony of the aira total of men despite this i feel that night creature basically was done in quite a simple manner it could have been developed into something far more complex and elaborate but essentially it tried to tell a rather simple story in fairly simple language the main purpose of it was to try to make the symphony swing which i believe we did very successfully what we did with night creature was in effect a new argument on a much larger scale than ever before against the theory that jazz cannot be written there are still a few diehards around who believe in this in fact not long ago i made up a little story to interpret their attitude there was a little raggedy boy out in the middle of a field he was wandering through the grass and stumbled over what appeared to be a black stick he picked it up and sat down under a weeping willow tree we of course know that it was a clarinet he was holding but he didnt know what it was but somehow or other intuition told him to just blow on itand when he blew out came jazz and thats the way jazz is supposed to be according to these diehardsits not supposed to be prepared or planned in any way another theory they hold is that there is such a thing as unadulterated improvisation without any preparation or anticipation it is my firm belief that there has never been anybody who has blown even two bars worth listening to who didnt have some idea about what he was going to play before he started if you just ramble through the scales or play around the chords thats nothing more than musical exercises improvisation really consists of picking out a device here and connecting it with a device there changing the rhythm here and pausing there there has to be some thought preceding each phrase that is played otherwise it is meaningless so as i say jazz today as always in the past is a matter of thoughtful creation not mere unaided instinct and although it is impossible for me or anyone else to paint any accurate picture of things to come i am sure that it will develop into something very big and beautiful it will be a combination of the contribution of all those people who are supposed to have natural ability and the work of all those who come out of the conservatories to add their embellishments as you may know i have always been against any attempt to categorize or pigeonhole music so i wont attempt to say whether the music of the future will be jazz or not jazz whether it will merge or not merge with classical music there are simply two kinds of music good music and the other kind classical writers may venture into classical territory but the only yardstick by which the result should be judged is simply that of how it sounds if it sounds good its successful if it doesnt it has failed as long as the writing and playing is honest whether its done according to hoyle or not if a musician has an idea let him put it down on paper and lets not worry about whether the result is jazz or this or that type of performance lets just say that what were all trying to create in one way or another is american music of fondue and faubus by hoyt w fuller t hope you do not mind j said my host herr john tesch i would like to ask you a question i told him of course that i did not mind frau tesch smiled politely and refilled my coffee cup tell me did you go to school with white boys and girls in america he asked to myself i thought well here we go the old problem again to herr tesch i replied yes i did was there the same kind of violence at your school as there was at little rock and did the whites try to keep you out of school i told him there was no violence at all then i explained that in detroit where i went to school white and negro children attend the same schools with no more than the usual conflicts common to children everywhere this was stretching a point and overlooking some school boundary gerrymandering here and there but it was true enough then would you please tell us what the problem is at little rock i reflected a moment before plunging into this now routine and expected discussion i explained that little rock was in the south the nations traditionally segregated section i cited the fouryearold supreme court ruling against separate schools i skimmed the surface of the political significance of governor faubuss action in calling out the national guard to frustrate the implementation of the courts ruling and explained that this left the president virtually no alternative but to support the court with federal troops my position was not a comfortable one it never is at these times europeans who actually are unfamiliar with continental united states are prone to see racial incidents there in terms of stark blacks and whites for many of them there is no significant distinction between little rock and detroit it is after all america if violence is perpetrated against a negro in montgomery the picture they get in their minds is simple whites attack negroes the regional and historical circumstances we customarily cite to excuse or extenuate the outbreak cannot serve the same purpose for them i glanced at the faces of herr and frau tesch their eyes were full of sympathy for me and for all the negroes in america and they were unquestionably sincere but i wondered if they would have the same sympathy and compassion if they lived in say maryland or indiana instead of in switzerland i would not prejudge them and yet this thought had occurred to me many times during talks with europeans who expressed outrage at racism in america as a reporter in detroit and chicago i learned that many of the whites most aggressive in barring negroes from housing schools and parks were first and second generation americans we had only just finished dining and removed to the living room for coffee cake and brandy the coffee was excellent perhaps the best i had tasted in all europe and the cake especially purchased for the occasion was delicious for dinner frau tesch had prepared what she called a typical swiss dish one we reserve to share with good friends it was a magnificent cheese fondue served with kirsch and tea and it was indeed a significant gesture at friendship the fondue casserole piping hot and kept that way over alcohol flames was placed in the center of the elegantly appointed table a huge platter piled with neatly cut sections of bread was put alongside to eat the fondue each diner had to take a square of bread with his fork and dip it into the chafing dish it was as intimate a meal as if the three of us were eating from the same plate the kirsch and brandy had mellowed my host and now relaxed in his easy chair in the compact but cozy room he was ready for an evening of quiet talk herr tesch holds a very responsible job in the finance department of the canton of bern a governmental division roughly comparable to an american county he is a seriousmiened and seriousminded man not yet forty very proud of his swiss ancestry and of the national swiss character which is conservative almost to an extreme he was emphatic in asserting his own conservative views but he was genuinely baffled and disturbed by the american mentality as demonstrated in incidents like that at little rock we find it difficult to understand he told me i dont think such things could happen in switzerland the racists behave as though negroes are not americans too swiss people might individually have dislike for negroes or might not wish to associate with them but i think it is inconceivable for the swiss to want to deny rights to other swiss or other people simply because they dislike them there is something so inhuman in that and especially when children are made to suffer i agreed herr tesch went on it seems to me these things are very bad for america your country is engaged in trying to influence other nations to your side countries in the middle east asia and africa surely america must know these nations will not respect americas message of freedom when negroes in america do not even have freedom here my swiss friend was not voicing a mere opinion following the korean war he had served on a united nations commission in that divided land he met and talked with thinking young men from several countries of asia and africa and they were all acutely aware of the great disparity between americas preachment and practice of democracy i told him there were many important americans who understood this very well but that there was little they could do beyond stating their case and appealing to reason there is something else something which bears only indirectly on these matters of race but i think it is important herr tesch said even in countries where the matter of race is no problem there is suspicion and distrust of america because of what happens to negroes there for example it is believed there is oil in the mountains here the swiss people do not have the capital to drill for oil and there are american firms which are interested but the swiss are reluctant to invite the americans in this might give them an opportunity to dominate our economy and our customs can americans be fair to others when they are not even fair to their own i think not america is the worlds biggest democracy and switzerland is the smallest but we like our brand of democracy better frau tesch a slim attractive young woman whose english was heavily accented had remained quite still during much of the discussion finally speaking very slowly she posed a question now that the situation at little rock seems settled at least for the present do you think there will be other such cases when the schools open again she asked yes i told her yes i think there will be many other such cases you must understand that there also are very powerful and influential forces in america which are dedicated to keeping negroes in a position of inferiority they are well organized and well financed and they will create disorders when and where they choose to she considered my answer for a moment then she shook her head sadly it is such a terrible thing she said yes i said i am afraid it is a terrible thing there was nothing more to say bern switzerland march a dangerous day in mississippi by c eric lincoln t all began with a promise that i had made the preceding christmas when a fishing rod turned up under the tree for my son cecil eric aged seven a fishing rod at christmas is of course a reasonable implication that there will be some fishing done the following summer the promised day finally arrived and at the crack of dawn lincoln four chubby little hands aided and abetted by a cheering section from the direction of the kitchen did without any ceremony whatever drag me from my slumbers with great insistence that i hurry and make worms come out of the ground with two sticksjust like when i was a boy i couldnt find the right kind of sticks any real fisherman knows that worms wont come up when you rub just any old two sticks together half an hour of spade work netted three worms and two blisters while the others were at breakfast i hurried around the corner to the fishermans one stop s and dug a whole boxful right off the counter for sixty cents back home i dumped them into a tomato can with the three we already had and went in to eat by ten oclock we were finally on our way i made a mental check to see if we had everything wife kids picnic basket fishing rods worms and of course gomer gomer was a fuzzy little puppy of dubious breed and uncertain parentage but gomer was a law unto herself where we went she went i had come to understand it and by majority vote i had to accept it we lived in memphis in the southwest corner of tennessee directly across the mississippi river to the west is arkansas and any of the highways leading south will land you in mississippi within half an hour or so a system of levees maintained by the u s army engineers protects the low country east of the river from floods and within a few miles of memphis there are a number of bayous between the river and the levees the bayous are widely known for good fishing now the levee which has been made famous by song and storyrises just outside the city limits and follows the river southward into the magnolia state our plan was to drive south on the highway for a few miles and to then turn off on the levee at some likely spot to look for one of the more accessible fishing holes among the bayous none of us noticed or remembered when we crossed the state line into mississippi there were two reasons why this was important one was that i did not have a mississippi fishing license the other was that i am a negro and there was a great deal of racial tension in that state at the time less than two weeks before on my way to memphis from atlanta i had driven more than a hundred miles out of the way to avoid traveling in that state instead of traveling u s through birmingham and tupelo i had gone around through chattanooga and nashville in order to bypass both alabama and mississippi the emmett till case had stirred up a lot of excitement and preliminary hearings on the murder were then going on in jackson as we clipped along the highway south of memphis and turned off on the broad levee all this was forgotten however i could only think of how good it was to be out of the city and the prospect of a day of fishing was more than refreshing now that the trip was underway it promised to be fun we kidded and sang as we anticipated the days catch little did we know that what we would catch that day would not be fish to the left of the steep levee were broad bottomlands of corn and pasture rich and verdant in the summer sun the fat whitefaced beef cattle grazing in some of the pastures reminded me that the economic base of the south was changing we saw no cotton only pastureland stretching for mile upon mile along the base of the levee occasionally we could hear the sharp staccato of a tractor and we could see the alfalfa and other silage being cut or raked and baled down the levee on the right rolled the dirtybrown brooding mississippi the father of waters between the river and the levee were occasional sloughs and bayous surrounded for the most part with a dense undergrowth and dotted with the grotesque trunks of cypress trees some of this land was fenced now and then we could see one or two scraggy brown cows switching flies in the edge of the undergrowth in sharp contrast to the fat cattle on the other side of the levee all in all it looked strangely familiarlike contrasting neighborhoods on opposite sides of a trolley line some ten or twelve miles down the levee road we noticed two small bayous in a clearing about fifty yards from the river bank a raingullied gravel road angled down from the levee and into the clearing a barbed wire fence ran along the base of the levee and a weather beaten stockgate brought the road to an abrupt halt we decided that this was as good a place as any to stop and try our luck besides a quick poll showed that we ourselves were per cent hungry so i urged the car carefully down the side of the levee toward the bayou young cecil undid the fastenings on the old gate and opened it with a flourish i drove into the enclosure following the crooked road atop the weedgrown embankment between the two small bayous my intention was to drive to the far side of the bayous to find a spot overlooking the river where we could spread our lunch there was no longer any gravel on the road now and the weeds and swamp grass all but obscured the road itself after we had driven almost half way across the embankment i could see that the road just ahead of the car was completely under water worse than that it now appeared that the embankment narrowed steadily as it neared the far side of the bayous we could no longer go forward and there was no way to turn the car around if we got out at all i would have to back the car some forty or fifty yards along a narrow slippery embankment partially under water and overgrown with weeds i got out of the car and went to examine the road behind us to my very great dismay i found that the ground was so soft and spongy that the tires of the car were already sunk in the mud almost up to the rims how does it look my wife asked i caught the strained note of artificial cheer in her voice damp and dirty i answered with equal bravado looks as if well have to back out i stood a moment debating with myself whether it would not be better to let the kids and their mother get out and wade back to safety through the mud and weeds a second look at the tall rank grass suggested that greater safety probably lay with the car the swamplands along the mississippi are well known for harbouring the deadly cottonmouthed water moccasin it was not an easy decision i climbed back into the car and eased it into reverse we inched back along the edge of the bayou and just as i began to feel like congratulating myself on my driving skill my son who was sitting on the rear seat opposite the driver leaped over and tapped me on the shoulder daddy he said with that wellknown tone most fathers recognize as the setting for a pleaseincreasemyallowance request yes what is it i wished very much that he would not divert my attention just then the car seemed to be sliding a little could you please stop the car and let us get out i turned off the ignition the car wasnt moving anyway why do you want to get out i demanded somewhat testily there are snakes out there well if you dont let us get out came the matteroffact rejoinder we are all going to be swimming in the bayou and there are alligators out there the car is getting ready to turn over i think the children had been taught never to panic in the face of danger and if the boy felt that we were actually about to turn over into the bayou i was very proud to note that there was no fear in his voice only intelligent concern looked back at little joyce she was wide eyed and silent she was not panicky but she was certainly not very happy either for that matter neither was i i got out and sloshed as nonchalantly as i could around to the back of the car no wonder it had seemed to be sliding the right rear wheel had slipped over the soft edge of the bayou and the car had settled on its axle at a crazy angle it was literally hanging over the water and slowly sinking deeper into the soft bank i hurried back around to the other side guess wed better all get out i said in what i hoped was a casual tone of voice the man is right she may go over sure enough and i wouldnt like to have to play hero in this bayou without my swimming trunks ok easy now lets all slide gently over this way and come out on this side easy now easy does it i prayed silently as the evacuation got under way first joyce then mother and finally after an agonizing eternity of seconds cecil popped out on the bank with the picnic basket under one arm and the eternal gomer under the other im hungry he announced without ceremony lets eat first so that we can be strong enough to push it out we made our way carefully back through the grass and weeds and out through the creaking old gate while the girls spread the lunch under a convenient oak i set out to look for help the stalwart sir cecil climbed upon the gate to stand guard hey dad he yelled as i started up the levee youd better come back as soon as you can and get our car out of here or were going to get put in jail right here on this gate it says private keep out in our enthusiasm to reach the water no one had noticed the weatherworn sign nailed to one of the cross bars on the gate with redoubled apprehension i trudged on up the side of the levee i had scarcely reached the top of the embankment when a car approached traveling in the direction of the highway in response to my waving and shouting the automobile pulled over to the edge of the read and halted it was occupied by a white man a boy of about ten and a suspicious looking collie i pointed down through the trees to where my car hung over the edge of the bayou and explained my predicament as rapidly as i could boy you shore are in a pickle the man said id shore hate to be in trouble on one of these plantations down here if i was you he shook his head ruefully and spat across the levee for emphasis it was only then that i came to a full realization of the potential gravity of our situation the term plantation forced my attention to the fact that was in mississippi plantation is a word which is almost never used in reference to a farming operation in tennessee i was in a pickle and i knew it how to get out of it as quickly and expediently as possible was becoming increasingly complex it was to become a great deal more complex before that day was over the white man offered to give me a lift a mile or two down the levee to a point from which i could walk to the plantation store he mentioned to me the boy got on the back seat with the dog and i sat with the driver it turned out that they were from memphis and that they had been hunting cypress knees down along the bayous they had a home workshop where they converted the knees into lamps and other objects for their friends the man said within a few minutes we came to a place where a dirt road angled down the far side of the levee away from the river and lost itself in a forest of tall green corn the man stopped the car and pointed to the road now if youll just follow that lit old road there for about a mile i believe itll bring you out mighty near that store theyve got over there if you cant get anybody over there to help you i expect youll have to go all the way into town to get a wrecker to drag you out cost you some money too i expect this is if anybodyll come boy you sure are in a pickle he added as an unhappy afterthought i thanked him for the ride and made my way down the side of the levee the road ran straight across the longest cornfield id ever seen after nearly half an hour of brisk walking i suddenly found myself in the back yard of a little unpainted cabin an elderly negro woman was drawing water from a well near the edge of the cornfield she told me that the main road was just a little way ahead and that id find the store jest a little ways down to the left it was past noon when i reached the plantation store and there were fifteen or twenty negro fieldhands sitting around under the trees eating their lunches from paper bags two men who seemed to have finished were sitting in a ford pickup parked under a black walnut tree i explained my problem to them and asked if they knew where i could hire someone with a tractor to come and pull me out one of the men immediately climbed out of the truck and left muttering something about it being time to go back to the field the other man who said his name was henry explained that it was the height of the haying season and that all available men were expected to be in the fields helping to get the hay in before the rains should come in another twenty minutes or so the dinnerbreak would be over besides all of the tractors were in the fields in use in the haying operations but henry opined i dont spect you need no tractor nohow this here lil old truckll outpull any tractor boss wheelers got on the place near about anyway he patted the green ford truck with real affection at that moment i was willing to love it too a few more minutes of talk revealed that boss wheeler was the plantation manager or straw boss that they were already behind schedule with the haying and that anyway he wheeler wouldnt be likely to accommodate me with a tractor if the last straw was in the barn and he had a hundred tractors rusting in the shed the only negroes boss wheeler liked were the ones who worked for him henry said i took it that it would be a waste of time to try to see mr wheeler on the other hand henry thought that if mr mac was on the place i might have better luck mr mac he explained was the owner of the plantation and his real name was mcculloch however it seemed that mr mcculloch had gone into memphis to a stock sale the only real alternative lay with henry and his ford i didnt really think the truck could do the job but then there was no choice we could try i explained to henry that he would probably be late getting back to work in the hay fields but that i would pay him for any loss he suffered he said hed have me out and fishing before anybody would miss him henry must have been born an optimist we got into the truck and roared off down the road and off through the cornfield when we had crossed the levee and come down on the other side near the river cecil swung the gate open and henry backed the truck out on the embankment and hitched it to the sadly listing automobile it looked as if the list had increased by about five degrees henry put his truck into second gear and the heavy logchain holding the two vehicles together grew taut as the pickup strained valiantly against the inertia of the heavy chrysler finally the trucks tires began to spin and smoke you could have smelled rubber all over the plantationand in less than five minutes the truck was hopelessly mired in the mud as for the car it had not moved an inchexcept perhaps deeper into the muck of the weedgrown bayou we unhitched the chain and tried to work the truck out but after half an hour we had only succeeded in getting it mired deeper into the oozing mud the transmission was soon resting flat upon the ground the negro field hand became quite excited he swore at the truck and struck the wheels with a length of chain finally he began to talk to the green ford as if it were a living thing alternately abusing it and then pleading with it to come on out of this ol mudhole at intervals he would leap into the cab and race the engine in a futile effort to shake loose from the awful grip of the mississippi mud eventually a second pickup appeared against the skyline high up on the levee at this point henry became almost incoherent and perspiration stood out upon his black face like glass beads the truck on the levee had turned off down the steep little road approaching the gate through which it had been our fate to come i sensed that it must be carrying the dreaded boss wheeler and that this was responsible for henrys state of agitation i tried to console him by thanking him for trying to help and promising to take the full blame for his predicament looking in my wallet i found seven dollars i gave it all to henry hoping that it could somehow help to make up for the trouble i had inadvertently caused him the pickup truck had stopped just inside the gate and a white man followed by a negro was walking rapidly in our direction suddenly my own apprehension increased my car was stuck in the mud and out of service besides that my wife and children were with me and i had just given away my last dollar if anything should happen to me they couldnt even get home i did have a checkbook but who out here in the wilderness could cash a check except the man on whose property i was a trespasser i studied the planter as he advanced on us he wore khaki trousers and a khaki shirt halflength leather boots and a pith helmet he was bronzed not very tall and looked to be about sixty years old he walked briskly and with a sort of bounce that seemed to carry him over the weeds instead of through them close behind him come willie bob the negro fieldhand who had refused to help henry when i approached them at the plantation store as they drew near henry climbed into the truck and began to spin the wheels more furiously than ever before the planter stopped and sniffed at the burning rubber well ill be damned he said stuck in the mud like toadfrogs both of them willie bob go over there and tell henry to turn that motor off before he sets the river afire turning to me he said thats a heavy car chrysler that little doodle bug of a truck cant pull it out between now and freezing cant pull itself out looks like to me he walked around to the rear of the pickup and tried to peer underneath it i was trying to get across here to do some fishing i tried to explain as soon as i could get a word in thought so thought so the white man interrupted used to be a little old road across here river backs up and washes it out every year you couldnt hardly drive a billygoat across here now let alone a car we both laughed at this and my anxiety began to subside a little mr mcculloch opened the door of the truck and motioned for henry to get out youd better locate yourself over on the other side of the levee before mr wheeler misses you he said or i expect youll catch it henry shuffled his feet and looked uneasily at the truck all mired in the mud he very plainly did not wish to leave that ford truck struck there in that mud never mind the truck mr mcculloch said tell wheeler ive got it willie bob take henry on back to the field and bring one of those tractors over here hell this truck isnt going to walk out of here all by itself the two fieldhands left in the planters truck instead of the awkward silence which might well have attended such an embarrassing situation as the one in which i found myself the next half hour or as fate decreed it the next three hours proved to be an unusual experience in human relations it turned out that some thirty years earlier the mississippi planter had studied pharmacy in atlanta the college of pharmacy from which he had graduated had long since ceased to exist and it had been twenty years since he had revisited that famous georgia city yet his interest in the people and schools the newspapers and other institutions of present day atlanta was as alive as it would have been had he lived there only yesterday we walked back toward the gate and sat down on a log beneath the oak where my wife had spread our picnic lunch by this time the conversation had shifted to farming and cattle raising and finally to how a man trained in pharmacy in atlanta came to be a farmer in mississippi it seems that the mcculloch family had migrated from scotland to this country in the early s settling first in georgia and eventually moving westward to mississippi where they acquired extensive land holdings after the civil war the family scattered some went west to california and alaska many went east to enter the professions of seven brothers only the planters father had remained with the landor what was left of it from his father he had inherited a few hundred acres on the condition that he would live on the land and hold it the lean years of the depression had shrunk the land still more it had been necessary to sell some in order to keep any at all but mcculloch had kept faith with his father he had stayed with the land and he had never practiced pharmacy again the conversation shifted this time to philosophy and the modern existentialist movement in europe and the question of its influence on modern art mr mcculloch had been reading sartre and we were lost in discussion when the roar of a powerful motor upon the levee announced the return of willie bob as a matter of fact willie bob had already driven down from the levee in the truck and parked it the motor we heard was that of a tractor driven by another hand and balanced precariously on the tractor couplinggrinning sheepishlywas henry mr mcculloch shook his head as long as henry has this truck to drive he said there is practically no chance of any woman ever claiming him for a husband the tractor was hitched to the mired truck with the log chain and in a minute or two the truck was dragged free henry climbed in and drove joyously away however fortune did not so favor us with the car a few minutes of pulling at the heavy chrysler only succeeded in miring the tractor in the mud up to its axles no amount of digging and packing the deep ruts with sticks and rocks seemed to help my embarrassment returned with increase when i heard the planter tell willie bob well have to stop those boys over in the south pasture and borrow their tractor willie bob drove away in the second truck eventually the second tractor arrived with two additional men with them they brought a number of shovels and another heavy log chain when we got the first tractor out we could hitch them both to the car and pull it out easily the possibility was cheering such was not to be the second tractor was hitched to the first and a driver straddled the seat on each they roared and spun their wheels but the muck was simply too soft for traction the second tractor was soon more hopelessly mired than the first the shovels were brought into into play the men dug around the wheels and tamped more rocks and sticks into the mire under them anxious to help i took a shovel and began to dig better let me have that shovel the white man said i never saw a college professor who could dig his weight in half a dayexcept at a dinner table he laughed and took the shovel without apparent effort he began to sling the muck over his shoulder with a rhythm matching that of the negroes again the tractors roared and spun their wheels and again they sank deeper into the mud mr mcculloch surveyed the situation for a moment by now my embarrassment was approaching fear willie bob he said finally we dont seem to be getting anywhere in a hurry go over on the hill there where theyre baling and get that big m tractor hurry now its getting late turning back to me he said now professor you dont have to worry ive got thirteen tractors on this plantation and if it takes them all well get you out now i expect your wife is upset too you go over there and tell her that we can handle it within minutes three more men came driving up on the biggest tractor id ever seen directly behind them came willie bob in his truck as the third tractor was being backed into position i could see henrys truck coming down off the levee there was a white man in the cab beside him the white man got out of the truck and came toward us on the run his face was very red and it was easy to see that he was angry the negroes fell back and let him pass he ignored me completely and strode over to where mr mcculloch was having the third tractor hitched to the second which was mired in the mud the planter seemed surprised to see him well he said casually i didnt want to bother you but were having a little trouble here mr wheeler the manager turned completely around and looked directly at me it looks like it he said in a highpitched nasal drawl a little trouble three tractors so far two trucks and a dozen hands that shore is a little trouble he spat in the mud without further ado wheeler began to shout orders at his men he had them take a small log and bind it lengthwise across the rear wheels of the second tractor then he himself mounted the machine and directed henry to pull with the big tractor hitched in front the motors roared alive now however instead of the wheels of the mired tractor spinning in the mud as before as soon as the log bound across them struck the ground the wheels were raised completely out of the muck and up to the surface of the road it was then a simple matter to fill up the tire ruts with rocks and drive the tractor out under its own power the same technique was applied to the tractor which first became mired and in less than ten minutes both were on their way back to the fields wheeler then tied both lengths of chain together and fastened the free ends to the big tractor and to my car the greater length of chain enabled the tractor to operate on comparatively solid ground and get better traction i got in the car to steer it in spite of the fact that there was a good possibility that it would topple over into the bayou as soon as it began to move the big tractor crept forward the chain grew taut and the car was dragged along the edge of the bayou until it finally moved wholly upon the bank as soon as i had the car in the road again the plantation boss re moved the chains threw them into the truck and drove away after directing his men to return to work immediately i felt frustrated because i had no opportunity to thank the man for his help in what had seemed an increasingly hopeless situation turning to mr mcculloch i tried again to apologize for trespassing and for the three tractors two trucks and a dozen hands who
