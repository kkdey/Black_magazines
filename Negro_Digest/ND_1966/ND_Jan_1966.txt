the dying beast of racism 
by louis e lomax
racistsunless the victim is a major negro spokesman merit one paragraph on page  of a nonsouthern daily a few pockets of resistance are left but the back of visible segregation has been broken and the reverend dr martin_luther_king jr has walked off with the top international peace accolade for having led the negrononviolently at thatto the waters edge of the american mainstream now that the season of pomp and circumstance has passed there is left the imperative and awesome if unspectacular miracle of reclaiming  million negroes from the bonedeep effects of  years of first slavery and then segregation just as awesome and unspectacular is the equally mandatory miracle of reclaiming the american white manhis heart soul and mindfrom the deep effects of having been first the slave owner and then the privileged majority in this historical tragedy if this republic uses its brain instead of its brawn its sense of history rather than its raw emotions then this will be the season of reclamation not recrimination true the race problem is far from solved just recently negroes and whites peered at each other over gun barrels in bogalusa la cores national director james farmer was leading his battalions including women and children to the firing lines martin_luther_king jr drew a bead on both los angeles and chicagochicago because of defacto school segregation and los angeles because that towns politicians had committed a monumental boondoggle that lost the community  million in poverty fundsas his nonsouthern summer projects naacpers fanned out from their convention in denver to a half dozen southern states to conduct voter registration drives and the congress of the united states lurched inexorably forward to passage of the most sweeping voter rights bill in human history these isolated events many of them tinged with tragedy are but passing entries in the diary of the negro revolt they are skirmishes which future historians will study as final evidence of the racial madness that had it been left unchecked for another quarter of a century was about to destroy this nation but time call it god if that makes you more comfortable was on our side collectively we mortally wounded the monster as he grew from slumbering childhood into wildly destructive adolescence the violence in the streets then from bogalusa to harlem from los angeles to jackson miss is the last wild death romp and scream of the stricken beast of racism there will be blood and more blood pain and more pain nothing approaching normalcy is due this nation for yet another decade but the beast will die and when he does the same forces that combined to deliver the lethal blow must recommit and reassign themselves to the task of reclaiming the union from the effects of the beasts presence in this land since its inception the reclamation of the negro has already begun no less than a dozen government agencies are now totally involved with seeing to it that any negro with the guts and brains becomes and does whatever his talents say he can become and do i know of at least a half dozen private agencies that are totally committed to the same project todays negro does not lack for opportunity alas the precise opposite is the fact everywhere one goes one encounters white bankers industrialists and ordinary businessmen looking for instant negroes who can qualify for jobs as vice presidents electronics engineers and grayflannel junior executives negroesof all shapes sizes colors demeanors and varying mental abilitiesweve got of supernegroes however we have none that is to say the american negro on the whole is an underdeveloped people if the middleclass white home and business communities are to be used as norms then the negro community is a total disaster area you cant get bankers from a community of people who never saw a banker with whom they could identify you cant get electronic engineers out of broken homes in which whatever parent symbol is left neither reads nor writes and when the negro children gather among the broken glass in the alleys of rochester n y to discuss what they are going to be when they grow up it is very unlikely that one of them would name a profession he never hears of and which societyin its total impact upon him and at the age of has told him he cannot achieve because of his color even if he has heard of it and wishes to achieve it one of the major tasks then in the reclamation of the negro is to inform and motivate those youngsters who are still in grade school upon whom the evil days have not yet fully come nigh ordinary classroom teaching will not do it if he is in fifth grade the chances are he is already reading two levels below his white classmates and is beginning to dream of the day when he will grow a little bigger and can drop out nor can ordinary classroom teachers negro or white do the job they are too involved with curriculum standards flow charts and bellshaped curves that children from harlem and chicagos south side skew just by walking in the classroom no regular classrooms and career teachers cannot accomplish the needed miracle rather the negro communityevery church every empty store front that can be refurbished and every day school after the regular classes are donemust be converted into a beehive of basic education these youngsters need to be taught more than to read write and speak well they need blunt thorough courses in precisely who they are and why and they should be forced to realize just what opportunities await them if they will apply themselves that is the place the time and the methodthe only place time and method i submitto breed the negroes who in the process of realizing their individual potentials will reclaim the negro for america the schools i like to call them studyins should be manned by the devoted kind of educated civil_rights workers who deserted the halls of yale harvard bryn mawr and swarthmore to march on selma and to enter the peace corps there is a more pertinent role in the negro revolt for these dedicated youngsters than having their heads beaten and bloodied in the dying south their finest hours will be in the ghettoes ot the northand the south for that matternot on picket lines and in demonstrations but in special classrooms where negro youngsters are being readied to avail themselves of the opportunities that have been won at such great price not all negro youth will respond more accurately most of them will not but as quiet as it is kept most white kids dont respond to the professional challenge either most white people are simple ordinary folks and that is what most negroes will turn out to be this then is the second major move toward the reclamation of the negro the american negro has never enjoyed the right to be ordinary if a negro steals it is a commentary upon his race if a white man steals he is just a bad fellow by the same token and as a result of the same racist logic the negro has never been able to get the ordinary jobs that keep the majority of the nations white citizens cloaked in security and dignity the wealthy and the professionals are not the economic backbone of the republic it is the ordinary workerthe clerk the welder the fireman the policeman the bartender the realestate salesman the plumber the automobile mechanicwho form that american phenomenon in the lower middle class and keep the national economy moving the lower middle class are ordinary people in ordinary jobs and the negro encounters more difficulty crashing that circle than he does the enclaves of the professionals and the rich this is why the median annual income of the average negro family is some  less than that of the white family and the gap is getting wider my own view is that entrance of the negro into the american lower middle class is the key issue the strategist for the negro revolution must deal with sitins have created negro opportunity but nothing short of studyins can make these opportunities become breadandbutter realities i realize i have spoken of the reclamation almost solely in economic terms but that is the american jargon that is the way of life in the country to which the negro is committed both by history and temperament i am the first to admit that change stirs in the american way of life perhaps as the new left suggests a new kind of economic thinking is in the making but the task before the negro revolutionaries is to prepare the negro to participate in what is the better he may participate in what will be 
conscience of a black conservative

wisest amo vf  if  £ race understand  j £ the mere agitation of rather than us be honest questions of social equality is the ex extremest folly and that progress in the enjoyment of all privileges that  will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle artificial forcing let no race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized american negroes must be free the nation agrees to that but the vigorous dr martin_luther_king jr and other negro leaders should stop merely urging their followers to protest march and demonstrate in the streets and start an enlightened campaign supporting not just social but economic viability among the black people an efficient organization and a determined application of negro intelligence towards his own deliverance and security are needed to make democracy workable in this country needed to make the negro influential in the american mainstream while the aim of civil_rights demonstrations was and is a necessary aim it is a fact of human nature that goals can be lost sight of and tactics glorified more than objective it seems reasonable to suggest that while a broad spectrum of public opinion one which embraces a majority of the congress and the white house supports specific legislation aimed against social injustice continued street demonstrations have an air of shoddy anachronism about them it is not easy to see why the importance of incentives and escalated productivity are so murky to overall negro leadership what i mean here is that the negro zeitgeist is blown up by its own bomb to base its policy primarily on protest equality cannot be legislated it must be gained by character and achievement a negro leadership which attempts to fulfill the constitution by keeping the negro from losing faith in freedom as the way of civilization is sagacious rather than combative however this leadership usually supplies no workable programs to help solve the negroes complaints the bible says somewhere that where there is no vision the people perish i am not preaching black nationalism when i point out that the economic status of the negro is not wholly contingent upon the will of the controlling white majority and that negroes are in danger of becoming a people of professional beggers but no one can complain forever let us deserve to be great if a measure of the money and energy that has been spent in trying to effect legislation to assure equality for the black people i love so much had been spent on economiceducational programs to help prepare them for civic responsibilities perhaps the situation we face in alabama new york and mississippi would be on the road to solution the latent talents of millions of young negro americans must be recognized encouraged and developed so as to provide them with a firm base in the nations economy and social order without such a base it is unrealistic to pretend that negroes can sustain the political and social rights which belong to them with the precision that made the march on wallaces state capital so successful let negro leaders now turn their attention to employment housing and education the three great areas where fundamental improvement is crucial to the negros progress to my way of thinking the health of our economy requires escalated negro productivity and a growing sense of negro responsibility one of the negros biggest handicaps has been his failure to understand and use economic and political leverage but the advantage of a positive policy by negro leadership is that it has the advantage of equipping negroes to compete the negro community should bear in mind that the greater society they aspire to will be dominated by economics again let us be honestabsolute equality is a goal that will probably never be attained that is an ideal not of this world however the administrations great society advocates are correct in the assumption that a social order can be created in which each section of the national community can justly feel that it is in no way exploited by the otherfor every great society must ultimately be genuinely constructive all of its members must have a stake in its existence the health of our economy also requires a growing number of negro businesses and a growing number of negro home owners hence the crisis in negro selfreliant enterprisewith only  per cent of all american negroes selfemployed or in a managerial capacity compared with  per cent for white workers the need for cohesion in the negro community is seen as essential to organized negro initiative and enterprise while i am not unmindful that historically the ambitious negro has been held down by a lack of education less access to the money market limited experience community segregation and invisible barriers thrown up by trade and fraternity organizations the fact remains paradoxically that there is a great deal more the negro could do to help himself the cry of uncle tom is positive proof of this two roads are open to negroes one for those who recoil from hard effort cavil at challenge who reject competition and would like to leave the shape of their future to programs subsidized by the federal government in their timidity and lack of vision such negroes declare the problems confronting them virtually insoluble to private effort brushing aside for the moment questions of free enterprise and expediency would such a program alone equip negroes to openly compete it is doubtful the other road is harder to tread at first it demands clear sight concern with means as well as ends and without going into technical details hereproduction planning perspective and cohesion in the negro community above all else we negroes are free to choose and we shall be responsible for our choice before history

by dr leo louis martello
ince time immemorial s £ man black and white f has been blackmailed into believing that self ishness is a vice that selfsacrifice is a virtue in the case of the negro in america deprived of his civil and more important human rights it would be more proper to call it white blackmail the little white lies consist of the following triumvirate faith force and fraud faith of the whitetaught negro converts meant his being blackmailed by the bible the christcross was used as a club to clobber his consciousness and selfrespect the ideal of all true believers a passive sissified christ nothing could be further from the truth christ was a man of courage of conviction who defied the conventions of his time he wasnt a martyr he was murdered quite a difference he defied his family his friends the high priests and the ruling romans turn the other cheek he was killed because he didnt the only time you should turn the other cheek is to get yourself into a better position to give your antagonist a good punch in the nose dont be bullied by a false interpretation of the bible the meek shall inherit the earth has bamboozled minority groups for centuries into submission the worst part of this is that it is an incorrect translation the language of christ was aramaic in which the words meek and wise are written the same the only way one can tell what meaning is meant is by the voice inflection or sentence structure scholars unfamiliar with this fact mistranslated the wise shall inherit the earth into the meek    all tyrants extol the virtues of faith since they cant possibly back it up by any facts when faith didnt work they used force murder torture violence lynchings terror what is seldom said though is that the victim is more morally to blame than the victimizer he has accepted without challenge the dogma of selfsacrifice he has permitted his enemy to rob him of the only weapon he has for survival his mind his intellect has been anaesthetised into believing that any claim to his rights any positive selfassertion any display of a healthy ego is wrong he is in conflict with himself a man divided is easily conquered the negros greatest battle today is not in the realm of civil_rights it is within the realm of himself those who are most militant in  their demand for equal rights no matter how just must make sure that this stems from a sense of justice and not from a desire for revenge every man black or white needs a sense of egoidentity if as a child he is made to believe that he is inferior he will grow up believing this he will either passively accept it and fail as a human being or aggressively and defensively fight his secret feelings about himself and become like those who made him that way what he needs to do most is challenge his own secret feelings not facts about himself no one is born with feelings of inferiority or superiority these are acquired during the formative years from unthinking adults not having the capacity to reason the child passively accepts other peoples estimates of himself he will live up to the image expected of him he will seek out those who are compatible with his own low selfesteem he forms unions of mutual contempt unable to respect himself he cant respect anyone else filled with selfloathing he perpetuates by word and deed the image of himself fostered on him by morally and intellectually bankrupt guardians or superiors this is the crime this is the tragedy even after and if he was granted all his civil_rights furnishing an outer target for attack giving him some selfrespect as a man he may be left with a vast emptiness why because he has failed to claim his right to himself he must recognize that all the evil committed against him as a negro or any other minority group is not a reflection on him as a man but on the unmanliness of the perpetrators as a child he didnt know any better didnt possess the intellectual equipment to block such impressions but as a man he does the terrible thing here is that so many try to claim their rights as men motivated by their feelings as children their passive acceptance their unconscious secret feelings of inferiority give moral sanction to their destroyers the public spectacle of fighting for their rights has less value collectively and individually than the private one of regaining the positive selfimage which is every mans birthright positive selfishness doesnt mean the popular conception of the parasite the plunderer the thinking only of himself at anothers expense it does mean independence dignity that no man has the right to ask you to sacrifice yourself for his interests or his to yours it means your right to refuse an unjustified request without guilt it means claiming your rights when you know that you are right and not letting yourself be imposed upon by the demands of others those who use deception in putting one over on the man are neither smart nor selfish they are selfless they are playing into the hands of their enemy living up to his image of them as unreliable    youve got to watch them every minute if they had any sense of self they wouldnt furnish this kind of ammunition to a bigot true selfishness that is morally right means never sacrificing your selfrespect never compromising yourself for an immediate gain never doing anything either for a favor or as a favor but only because its in your best interest theres one thing that no man can give you no man can take away from you your selfrespect any time you accept less than what you know is your due any time you play along or permit someone to take unfair advantage any time you lay down your weapons you have no right to cry unfair its the same as the victim giving his executioner the gun that will kill him your greatest weapon is your mind your positive selfishness your dignified conduct as a human being this is the only way you can fight the bigoted enemy with his own ammunition like it or not he is forced to deal with you man to man the only criterion in your dealings being value for value 
an epitaph for nonviolence 
by dr nathan hare
artly because of the j tfti l way wich nonvio vr f lence has been misused by negro leaders in the united states there are signs that that doctrine at least as we have known it up to nowis slowly but surely on its way out of the negros struggle these signs include the los angeles riots in which a violent form of civil disobedience or active resistance erupted in excess of the harlem case the year before then there are the deacons for defense and justice now emerging in the deep south the tolerance and treatment given the deacons by the press is in contrast to the persecution of robert williams and his lieutenants who sought to use violence in self defense in monroe north carolina some years ago however there are indications that the deacons are not as consistently radical as they may seem for example in a laudatory magazine article recently a picture showed them helping louisiana cops corral and control negroes but it is still a step in the direction of violence has given a measure of respectability to the use of retaliatory violence by negroes and helped to establish a new standard of militancy as a matter of fact only recently although after this article had been conceived a sncc leader revealed  unsolicited by me  that his group is dropping nonviolence for the most part because negroes in southern localities where they are being killed by whites no longer want to listen to a nonviolent ideology that is one of the main reasons he explained that martin_luther_king is moving his campaign to the north even there king may encounter difficulty dick gregory was shot in the leg when he tried to control los angeles watts negroes and being in los angeles at the time i even heard a middle class negro remark that they should have shot martin_luther_king in a certain portion of his anatomy this not only indicates a rejection of unilateral nonviolence it also reflects a budding inclination for negroes to choose their own leaders instead of merely accepting those approved and promoted by the white power structure and its press  let us then consider the reasons behind the emerging disenchantment with nonviolence as we have known it so far one is that nonviolence has largely failed to bring a significant amount of measurable equality while there have been some conspicuous gains the negro has not progressedin spite of propaganda to the contraryin the manner that he must if he is to obtain equality in the next one thousand years my analysis of census data shows that while negroes gained occupationally during the forties when they were needed in war industries to replace job vacancies left by white soldiers they did not gain during the fifties in spite of the supreme court decree and the passive resistance movement negroes obtained some middle class tokenism the order of the day in every sphere including symbolic jobs such as air line stewardess symphony orchestra base fiddler and so forth but statistically as a group they did not gain on whites during the fifties the negro did move up some from his past position owing to changes in the economy but whites moved up faster maintaining the previous gap a census economist has found that the negros income is only about  per cent of that of whites much similar to the ratio a half century ago in the area of school desegregation in the south more than nine out of ten negro students still attend segregated schools now more than ten years after the supreme court decreed desegregation with all deliberate speed border states have moved ahead with desegregation only to slip back into resegregation with previously allwhite schools swiftly becoming allnegro even in the north such cities as new york which at least three years ago had only one negro school principal philadelphia and chicago have about as much or more de facto segregation in the schools as they did in  the year of the supreme court decision ironically aimed at the south    studies at the population research center the university of chicago have revealed that there was no significant decrease in the amount of spatial or residential segregation in us cities during the fifties in fact chicago had the highest index of spatial segregation of any city in the world including southern cities south africa and the castes of india eleven oclock sunday morning is still the most segregated hour of the week nine out of ten negroes belong to allnegro denominations and most of the rest attend allnegro church houses prayins have failed to penetrate those earthly gates to heaven although more lipservice and in a few cases active participation was obtained from white preachers who left their allwhite churches now and then as in the selma march to join the negros civil_rights struggle as a matter of fact i for one was never more appalled than when five years after the montgomery bus boycott a greyhound bus carrying freedom riders through montgomery was attacked and burned in the first place i had been riding the front of the bus local as well as interstate practically all my life in oklahoma texas and missouri admittedly as some friends have pointed out that was not alabama but i do not believe that the difference would have occurred to me then my negro friends did not believe me even then except when they happened to see me in which case whites would look at me like i was crazy and negroes would look at me like i was crazy then head straight for the back sometimes mumbling such things as just want to start some trouble or just acting a fool i remember when i was ten years old holding up a bus which ran from bristow to beggs oklahoma for thirty minutes while the driver sought to persuade me to move to the back in a larger place the police would probably have moved me by force but in that small locality everybody knew that my mother would have come for them with her shotgun had they laid a finger on me anyway my policy ever after was never to move rear of center even if i had to stand while seats were vacant in the rear but drivers would roll their eyes at me and i would roll mine back at them and nobody bothered me except once that day i sat down beside a white farmer who had on dirty overalls i returning from a testing center where i had taken the graduate record examination was dressed in coat and tie the white farmer said to me why dont you go to the back where you belong i told him why dont you put me back there i had just won a golden gloves championship in oklahoma and was anxious to try out a recently perfected left hook but i could not aggravate him into saying anything else but enough of my personal experiences the important difference was that i was acting as an individual and any rebellion to be successfulwhether nonviolent or violentmust be a collective enterprise and is no better than its degree of organization however i used to wonder what would have been the impact if a majority of negroes had been refusing to conform even as individuals to the souths policies of segregation why then is nonviolence failing in the united states aside from the fact that it is unnatural to mans makeup most negroes have never taken part in a nonviolent demonstration and say that they could not remain nonviolent under fire nonviolence has been carried out in a hypocritical and dogmatic fashion many negroes instinctively realize that it is utterly american to fight back when attacked and they know  that it is lawful even to kill a man in self defense negroes have been socialized into that cultural norm and are coming to see the curious contrast between nonviolence for them and the customarily unpunished killing of negroes including army majors in uniform by white southerners it is easy in this context to discern the inconsistency if not the hypocrisy of martin_luther_kings statement in his stride toward freedom that it is immoral for negroes to fight back when attacked by southern whites but that us efforts to violently deter an ideology such as communism is another thing incidentally king himself as told in the same book went down to apply for a pistol permit when his life was threatened during the montgomery boycott mind you the growing number of persons who question nonviolence have nothing against it as a tactic or strategem they merely believe that it should stay on that plane be put to use when that seems proper but abandoned when obviously ineffective and unjust the dogmatic approach to nonviolence heretofore is a result some say of the prevalence of negro preachers in the movement and the fact that negroes have tended to demonstrate a capacity or inclination to make everything a religion or pseudoreligion the new negro militants point to the fact that the oppressors justify the use of violence and even demand that negroes take part in wars of violence against persons who have never harmed them personally even a mississippi freedom democratic party bulletin has pointed to this paradox many negroes recall public school textbook accounts of the boston tea party where colonists with grievances boarded a ship and chopped up a supply of tea this brought up to date would be tantamount to a negro chopping up a lunch counter the new negro militant admires in the way that most americans are taught to do the speech of patrick henry when he stood and said give me liberty or give me death if a negro should stand and say that they would probably give him death the new negro militant familiar with history recalls the holy hell of the holy crusades when primitive christians took up the sword and used violence to persuade others to adopt a policy of nonviolenceto turn the other cheek then later while the negro was turning the other cheek they were kicking him on his other two and yet those persons now beginning to flirt with a philosophy of violence still reveal that they prefer a nonviolent approach accordingly as revealed in an esquire article the red chinese american negroes by william worthy a year or two ago they aim to squeeze the last drop of hope out of nonviolence and the similar though contrary to popular fallacy not equivalent  tactic civil disobedience i should point out that many of the negroes that worthy one of the most militant negro journalists described as red chinese american negroes felt that he had sold them out linking their cause with the hated red chinese who lack respectability and approval in america and suggesting by implication as whites are inclined to do that negroes do not have native sense enough to structure their own rebellion but must always be moved by some other group anyway these negroes are beginning to advocate that we must forsake the kind of token civil disobedience we have known before and prepare for a policy of total civil disobedience the concept of total civil disobedience is synonymous with the general strike proposed by the classical social theorist georges sorel in reflections on violence james meredith while at the university of mississippi ole miss apparently came across sorels work he proposed a general strike but being misseducated pun intended thought that it meant negroes should designate a day and take off fifteen minutes from work however this is not even the equivalent of a coffee break what sorel meant by his general strike and what the slowly growing number of new negro militants have in mind is more extreme to use a favorite adjective of the white press  the new negro militants propose that negroes passively resist participation in wars to preserve democracy so long as their government does not guarantee them democracy in their own land as a mississippi freedom democratic partys bulletin recently did refuse in the manner of the american colonists to pay the tax they owe so long as they do not have equal representation possibly refuse to work in the manner of south african negroes in the  strike boycott the downtown area altogether stallin cars turn on water faucets and let them run put sand in the sewers and in general refuse to cooperate they long to bring this society to a halt to jeopardize its economy against negro rights and to let the world know that negroes will no longer obey or cooperate with a hypocritical and morally decadent society this attitude has occasionally infiltrated even civil_rights workers the march on washington for example had to be taken over by the white power structure who put moderate leaders such as martin_luther_king and roy wilkins according to an item in the washington post at its helm originally planned as a true march on washington to liein congress and tieup the capitols functions it became instead a jolly parade in washington with orderliness as its goal the white power structure told negroes how to march and when to leave a sncc leaders speech was censored so that a white catholic archbishop would agree to take part the proposed stallins before the worlds fair in new york came to an even more abortive fate as national leaders pushed by white contributions and control condemned the tactic as going too far the negro revolution is then unique in terms of world history in that white oppressors are allowed to tell negroes how and when to rebel new negro militants complain however the switch away from nonviolence is only dimly in sight in the first place talk always precedes revolution as it is necessary first that an oppressed group come to realize that a true revolution is essential this is occurringand will become more extreme in the futureas negroes increasingly reveal the other prerequisite for revolution a loss of faith in the feasibility of routine conventional means for righting the wrongs they suffer if it continues to seem necessary that negroes turn from token civil disobedience to total civil disobedience new negro militants are inclined to approach it with a hope for nonviolence but when and if they are met with violence let the chips fall where they may  
a white american faces his dilemma
by ken jon booth
three months of  ¦ ira g the year that im away  i £ from my classroom in   denver i spend be £ hind the whed of a jolly jerry ice cream truck as i daily dispense bubble gum and ice cream bars i drive through neighborhoods with which im not familiar several days ago as i pulled up to the curb at the hail of a three year old my mind was busy with the guessing game that always follows is this little one a customer or does he merely want to pass the time of day for the ice cream man is every childs friend i was in luck for the young fellow finally managed to communicate the idea that he wanted the one with peanuts deciphering such a message is something of a feat i can understand my own all right but other peoples three year olds often are a mystery just as id wrapped the little fellows fingers around his change and admonished him to scoot home to mama before he lost it i looked up into a face that looked inquiringly at me didnt you go to north the young handsome man asked me i answered that i had and then recognized mike we shook hands warmly and exchanged last names which wed both forgotten mike was visiting denver from his new home in california after hed gotten the ice cream hed come for i invited him to visit me at my home while he was in town in fact i quite nearly insisted mike agreed to call the next time he was in town we said goodbye and probably will never meet again with one exception there is nothing strange about our meeting it can hardly be called a reunion for we hardly know one another the exception is this why should i have invited a school acquaintance i hadnt seen in ten years to my home and be so adamant about his acceptance why should i have been so much more delighted at seeing mike again than i would normally be about seeing an old acquaintance considering it i can find only two reasons and one of them makes me a little more than ashamed if mike has done any thinking about the matter then i should do well to be humiliated the lesser of the two reasons is that when we were in high school together i did like mike in our infrequent encounters the second reason has to do with such mixed and complex factors that they are far too easily summed up in saying it is because mike and i live in two different worlds and i feel guilty about it reflecting upon our meeting it seems to me that my effusive good  will must have been a disappointment to mike for until then he possibly thought our differing colors meant nothing to me that of course is the impression i always seek to give for i have been told over and over again from childhood that the negro is very sensitive to any notice being taken of his color im sure my mother meant well in fostering that idea but it in no way changes the fact that such a thing is the rankest hypocrisy who but a blind man can fail to notice that someone is male or female black or white even so it is a part of my upbringing that cannot be erased from my subconscious at this late date therefore to me the negro will always be sensitive about color in connection with this i was taught that to inflict discomfort in any wayor to hurt anyones feelings was the vilest act of callous cruelty that could be done to anyone therefore my subconscious being an obedient thing to its teachings i must bend two fold backwards to avoid taking any note of mikes or anyone elses color isnt that foolish it is more than that it is pitiful yes pathetic if you will for it means that throughout my life i am completely helpless in establishing any sort of valid relationship with any member of a race other than my own i will be so afraid of offending or hurting someone that i will remain a sycophant always seeking to say and do the right thing ive kept these ideas out of my mind until recently for it is not a pleasant thing to admit to oneself that he is one of the very devils he has been trying to slay thinking back however i can trace the pattern easily my first contact with a negro was in an elevator in new york and in all innocence i told the gentleman your face is dirty and your mother will be angry with you i dont remember if the man smiled or answered for the shocked and horrible silence in the car filled with white people instantly informed me that i had committed a crime of some sort but i hadnt my own mother god rest her had she had never acknowledged the fact that there are peoples of different colors on earth to me any skin that wasnt white was in need of cloth and soap nothing was ever said about the incident but i have never forgotten it also the black man has fascinated me ever since just before world war ii we lived in pennsylvania and i began school in pittsburgh one of my playmates was a boy named sammy sammy was not a white boy but i had learned by that time that his face wasnt dirty mother had even gone further before i was enrolled at the school she had told me very patiently now kenneth there will be negro children in your school some people dont like them and are mean and hateful to them i dont ever want you to be unkind treat them just like you would anyone else  now stop and reread that quotation which i can still hear twenty some years later the ears of a child are sharp and the senses of adults tend to dim but reading and hearing it again now i see an implication in those words so deadly that it is difficult to be charitable even to mothers good intentions for that bit of preschool advice carries with it so clearly the thought that you little white boy must be kind to these lesser beings now what ever gave that dear lady the idea that a child left to himself would treat one child differently from another what is the phrase unless ye become as little children       i was a dutiful child when i struck up a boyish friendship with sammy i brought him home from school with me we had cookies and milk in the kitchen with mothers blessing that is until she walked into the kitchen poor mother what a look on her face she must have been thinking will this child of mine never stop taking everything i say literally its to mothers credit that she didnt mention the incident but then she didnt have to although i continued to play with sammy we did so on the playground and at his house for his mother never made me feel unwanted now that was in  except for mike who i knew as a nodding friend in the halls at school and as a fellow entertainer i knew no one else of another race until i entered the university of missouri at kansas city in  in kansas city i came to face the facts that denver is not representative of the relationship between white and black in denver there was a time when negroes sat in the back of the streetcar sat only in the theater balcony and did not visit the amusement parks or swimming pools gradually over the years the situation changed there is no longer any obvious segregation in denver what segregation there is is a subtle thing about which i know too little to speak the situation in kansas city then was something of a shock to me the university custodian constantly embarrassed me by calling me mr and sir he was i believe what is known as an uncle tom no amount of entreaty could change his subservience to me never would he call me by my first name as i asked him and he was forever doing demeaning tasks which were unpleasant for him and which i could and should have done for myself i must have tried to outwit that old man a hundred times but no matter where i hid my dirty ash trays he found and washed them no matter where i tucked away my lunch leftovers anticipating an opportunity later to dispose of them the old fox extricated them and bore them away with a smile i constantly expected him to break into a chorus of ov man river and beneath it all i knew he would see me in hell with no regret if ever the day came so it was i discovered bervin bervin was one of the crack debaters on the umkc championship team and we were in the same area of study taking my courage in my hands i arranged an accidental meeting between us one afternoon in my office it is the only time in my life that i dared to discuss the problem openly although the amount of time it took me to get warmed up and to the point must have been a trial for him the next few weeks were spent listening to bervin and asking questions but the most pressing question he couldnt answer and i havent been able to answer it satisfactorily myself what shall i do what is my part in this bervin did not know i think i do know but it is little comfort to me for the part i am able to play is so minutely small that its effect cannot be measured for years and it may by then be too late i can do about all that i am able to only by being honest with those negroes with whom i come in contact and by allowing my children to grow up without acquiring my prejudices i dont try to turn my daughter and sons against parsnips just because i dont think they are fit for human consumption have i any more right to influence my children in their reactions to other people so obvious a rhetorical question needs no answer very well then my job is to be the best father i can and to be honest one sunday while sitting with core at the kc liberty memorial i thought about this part that i can play it is not enough being a good father is a basic responsibility and duty sitting with core does not end hatred what is there for me to do ive asked this of many people but mostly of myself bervins answer was this theres nothing for you to do this is not your fight it is ours you can help by keeping out of the way youre a teacher arent you well then thats your job thats where you can help you cant change things by standing in front of your class and preaching against the outrageous things that have happened and are happening the only thing you can do is just what youve told me you try to do with your students to make them think and to make them seek truth in all things and bervin is perhaps right if i can make a few begin their searches for truth and to think well eventually come out all right prejudice and hatred exist where they are born in ignorance and fear but how many generations of my children must be bom and live and die before the stain has been erased from their minds how many more little children must die in church basements how many more must be cursed spat on and killed before all of our consciences can bear no more the negro is not the only one who suffers in this time of struggle and terror the bitter white suffers of fear and horror just as real the white who neither hates nor knows suffers indirectly from being deprived of what the two races together could achieve and as for me and those like me we suffer guilt and impotent rage because our own futile petty attempts to redress wrongs are far greater than our powers to cure them jc  but from my ice cream truck i see hope true it is not a very great hope and its road ahead is a very long one but it has begun the hands that reach for my ice cream are black and white and tan and countless other hues they dont care who stands next to them nor who is first in line as long as turns are taken their purchases completed they return to playing in their yards with one another we have slowly come this far but i smile to myself as i drive through the streets for even with the for sale signs in groups and strips of tens and twelves the inevitable has happened billy has  hit johnny with a fast right hook and their mothers talk it out over the back fence it isnt too impressive perhaps but what mother in the world would deny johnnys friend bill a place at the birthday table am i naive to think then that the way is before us am i but grasping at straws in my own desperation to spare my children from living with unfounded hatreds by believing that billy and johnny will always be friends when they have been neighbors as children i think not no i think not for all of our follies our blunders our stupidities and pettiness we yet remain that wonderful creature as ugly as he is beautiful as loving as he is brutal man and as long as we are part of man we must progress to better times and worlds i know i am mouthing the ideas of the people who maintain that we must let things alone and they will turn out all right i also know the young negro and white today do not want to leave things alone things should be made right and it must be done now youth has always thought so if it didnt we would still be a colony of england and even then there were those who said let us live side by side with the british and we will be friends but it did not happen a war was inevitable and only after it was foughtafter the blood was shed and many died and many tears fell into our souls and soildid we find the things which had bound us together all along the fact that we all were men if it must come to that let the time come soon so that we may at last get down to useful purposes and build together in the meantime be charitable and give us a moment in your thought we who are intruders in a world we have not seen and do not know and are drawn by that mutual bond of humanity and yet must ever remain bound to our pasts as a turtle to his shell how heavy those shells become at times and how we long to free ourselves from them  
how to open corporate jobs to qualified negroes
by dr andrew f brimmer
many corporaw £ tions are making an  effort to recruit nesr°es for management positions the success so far has been only marginal this result has come about partly because of the general lack of technical preparation on the part of most minority group members for the specific job opportunities which exist at the managerial level and partly because corporate managers are usually recruited at the junior level and advance on the basis of internally acquired experience clearly if the objective is to quicken the rate at which managerial opportunities for minority group members are opened this is a selfdefeating system thus some method must be found to increase the momentum while i along with everybody else have no panacea to recommend the following approach appears to be promising although few negroes currently possess the technical skills most in demand by corporations a relatively large number of negro college graduates have acquired educational and employment experience in fields not wholly removed from general administration among such fields are public and educational administration law mathematics insurance real estate and the social sciences for example in  there were about  nonwhites who had four or more years of college work of this  about  were classified as professional technical and kindred workers and approximately  were managers officials and proprietors today these numbers are undoubtedly larger while the vast majority of these nonwhite college graduates are probably uninterestedor unpreparedto pursue a career in corporate management a substantial number may well find this attractive the big question ishow to convert such welleducated professionals into potential corporate managers as noted above initial entry in virtually every case is at the beginning levels which carry salaries too low to appeal to most non white college graduates with professional experience on the other hand the salaries earned by the great majority of nonwhite college graduates are by no means double the typical beginning salary paid to management trainees by corporations this fact seems to point to a promising vehicle to attract more nonwhites into corporate enterprise for example if an arrangement could be devised which would permit professionals with basically sound training in the social sci ences public administration and related areas to devote one year to a specialized graduate course in business administration a fairly large number might be able to make the transition into the corporation and assume responsibilities at the intermediate level in a number of areas a few fields seem especially promising eg personnel administration public relations marketing research and advertising with more investigation other areas may also be identified if such a plan were considered its feasibility would turn heavily on the solution of at least two basic issues in the first place the average negro professional already established in a relatively secure although perhaps lowpaying position may be reluctant to abandon his present spot to return to graduate school and then risk the problem of finding a job in an entirely new field thus it may well be necessary for a fairly large number of corporations to identify in advance a group of minority group college graduates with managerial potential these corporations might then have to commit themselves to providing a job opportunityat least on a trial basisfor the successful candidates to start after the oneyear training period secondly financial resources would have to be found on a fairly large scale to support the oneyear retraining experience while corporations themselves may well find it desirable to provide a portion of these funds it seems more likely that one of the leading foundations may consider this a worth while project while no firm estimate of the cost of such a project even on a modest scale can be provided several bench mark figures seem reasonable as a minimum one might want to avoid imposing a severe burden on the candidates family during the year of graduate study in  the median income for nonwhite professionals in the social sciences was about  thus a stipend between  and  per candidate for one year may well be sufficient to attract a fairly large number of highly qualified applicants if it is assumed that tuition and other overhead would add about  to  the sum required per candidate may well be between  and  thus to launch the program with  candidates would require an expenditure of  to   in terms of the magnitude of many foundationsupported programs this sum is by no means out of the ordinary while such a program would clearly be a modest beginning it would be a beginning on a systematic basis its benefits would extend well beyond those derived by the individual candidates who would improve their immediate employment positions and by the corporations who would obtain competent employees the program would also demonstrate to minority group young people that expanding job opportunities in the corporate sector are a reality they could see in a relatively short period of time a growing number of members of minority groups actually acquiring managerial positions in corporations this visibility would have a feedback effect and would help to raise and reorient the aspirations of minority group youth it would also stimulate the revision and improvement of curricula at predominantly negro schools which increasingly would begin to prepare graduates to enter upon managerial careers along the ordinary routes established by corporations 
an examination of mission work in africa
by wilton sankawulo
image of the mism sionary in africa like indeed that westerner is to define thing the coming of the missionary into africa was contemporary with the coming of european political power which was drastic revolting and of course rewarding in many ways the missionary has unfortunately been classed with the politicians as imperialists by some africans  their influence as a whole is suspect and the africans have been trying to remove what they believe to be unjust about it trying to be free from it wherever the question of injustice arises objectivity towards any particular problem is likely to be lost for the struggle for right like that of any cause is hard to be restrained from sacrificing even what is good in order to attain its goal the image of the missionary in particular presents a special problem for mission work is based on a theory of sacrificial selfgiving and the theological concept of human brotherhood reasonably enough anyone who cares about being realistic will admit readily that mission work more than any other foreign institution has made the most significant contribution to the development of africa im speaking in terms of the qualitativeand not primarily the quantitativeextent of it the mission work involves the whole man body mind and spirit this is principally the only reason for any success it may have but the fact that lutheran mission work for example could operate in liberia for a period of one century statistically producing about  christians suggests that its success is not commensurate with the time the money and the effort invested into it the reason for this may be apparent in many ways or practically hidden to everyone it means that it is time for some reconsideration some analysis  examining what mission work is like today and perhaps what it ought to be but it is a difficult if not exceedingly risky thing to do most missionaries at least from my experience and those supporting mission work would consider it reckless and ungrateful if an african man should do it but as plato said an unexamined life is not worth living and so it is only by running ultimate risks that one can look at things objectively discovering faults where they lie hoping to bring about improvement what missionaries are accused of today which is supposed to be a deterrent factor in mission work one that they themselves are first in admitting  is the iconoclastic attitude they have somehow used and are using against african culture the question of imposing their culture has become a profound subject of protest to the africans this arises chiefly from a nationalistic spirit tinged with the africans quest to be free and to be himself selfacceptance is one basis for improvement where the self is denied something of a caricature emerges to represent it and because a caricature is not true to the self it misrepresents it destroys it ive met some africans who paradoxically deny their tribal origins even refuse to speak or write tribal dialects for them improvement means adopting a western identity but then the true self is selfwilled and will never easily yield to a foreign identity and so they have to surrender all the claims their origins have upon them and live with an identity not very clear to them this is painful ive seen many such africans deny their parents because they lived in the tribal tradition and the tragedy of this is that western society will not accept them on equal termsperhaps because they have very little in common misplaced and rootless they live by an illusion which they know as an illusion but they work restlessly in making themselves believe that the illusion is truth the amount of damage this can do to the self and the social problems it creates are unlimited   it was the danger of this inescapable fact that persuaded missionaries and africans alike to believe that something peculiar of africa must be retained in her contacts with the rest of the world culturally religiously and politically most african writers and politicians would call this the african personality what this personality is what it should be is not known to everyone most africans i know take it to be the traditional way of living excluding everything that has to do with the west or the east but of course these africans would not stop using electricity spoons plates clothes cars etc made in usa to them who go so far with the west and still raise the question of their own uniqueness i would say you are raising this question in order to create conflicts of ideas and feelings for youre no different from a westerner in your mode of living african writers who are the intellectual supporters of this personality would write about the rain pelting on the jungle leaves the beauty of the gods the ancestral spirits and the mystery surrounding everything in africa not simply as things that exist but as the ideal things that exist for the africans this is perhaps why westerners today say lets leave them and their ways we shouldnt impose our ways upon them for they are too technical and advanced for them all they see now the best that can be done out of a bad job is to preserve africa as an area where they could go to study primitive tribes when they want to write new books in anthropology this is exactly what esther warner meant when she said that all missionaries ought to be anthropologists but if the missionary is in africa merely to accept things as they are without effecting any change then what is he doing there the african personality defined in this manner is completely reckless it remains a glorious mythas ezekiel mphahlele puts it it is a way of closing your eyes to what the rest of the world is doing change is the basis of all advancements even the west passed through the age in which evil was checked by exercising witches other ways more realisticthough not necessarily more successful as human nature is still the same had to be devised to handle the problem of evil to burn a man at the stake for instance because he differs with the popular belief is no more a common practice in the west when i advocate change here i dont mean blind adoption of western culture the chinese culture is very different from the western one but one cannot say as a rule that the western dish is better than the chinese dish if there should be a personality peculiar of africa in any way it must be one that will grow one that will relate itself with the rest of the world because africa is a part of the world it is exceedingly unrealistic to explain things in terms of african reality alone the time has passed for one social class to consider only those of similar attributes and persuasion as friends branding all others as foe merely because they are different as the animals in george orwells animal farm tried to do consequently i want the african personality that will in the first place accept its own heritage and fearlessly eliminate elements in it that are archaic and useless in coping with modern reality our music for instance could be organized analyzed and developed in its own right to the point where it would make its own impact on the world we need our bachs our beethovens we cant be satisfied with mere mediocrity our writers should stop praising the jungle its wild life and superstitions as though they constitute the apex of our civilization we cannot convince ourselves that this kind of life is all we need because the high rate of death the fear and insecurity superstitions bring together with the erosive havoc of ignorance disease and poverty all bear witness to how much we have to do on the other hand enthusiastic converts should never condemn the african traditions as a whole we have to accept our past with the idea of making improvement on it not for building a false monument to it or destroying it i want the african personality that will not be afraid to borrow from any quarters whether east or west in order to strengthen itself to enrich itself we must never imagine that there is a pure culture in the world just as we should never imagine a pure race western culture is not purely western it borrowed from every other culture western philosophy for example has some elements of the thoughts of confucius as well as maotsetung and some historians and anthropologists are united in saying that western civilization began on the shores of africa i would not hold it against missionaries for that matter when they attempt to put a stop to most of the superstitions and the primitive ways of living they encounter in africa all of this is not primarily done from selfish motives and it is our responsibility to correct where the intention has gone astray if we can face this as a fact if missionaries accept themselves as human and therefore fallible it is only then can mission work succeed in producing positive effects in africa   james baldwin has said any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it the loss of all that gave one an identity the end of safety  it is only when a man is able without bitterness or selfpity to surrender a dream he has long possessed that he is set freehe has set himself freefor higher dreams for greater privileges the only thing that would justify the agony of change and make it bearable is an adequate reason for bearing it at all what most missionaries have not cared about doing is giving adequate reasonsthe reasons they give are often tenuous for changing some aspects of african culture in order for it to cope with christian morality this finds a clear expression in the late albert schweitzers attitude towards the natives his work with them was based on the premise that they do not think profoundly and thus must be told what to do what to think without knowing the reason why in fact he went so far as to say that where the question of christian love is concerned he and the natives were brothers with the restrained observation that he was their big brother but the africans as far as i know are looking for friends and not particularly big brothers in breaking the bound of foreign rule they have become rather sensitive of domination of any kind even if branded with the name of christian philanthropy ive heard some of these natives say that anything done for them should be done out of love and not pity or pride it goes without saying that the question of honor if neglected in dealing with people soon makes itself felt in a crisis and ultimately negates every good intention and service a man would normally prefer to be poor rather than sacrifice honor and freedom for riches i remember a missionary who said to the africans in denouncing polygamy this is unchristian you see we missionaries practice monogamy because it is the christian way of marriage he left unsaid many other things which could have made his denunciation produce some positive effect rather than protest the africans were quick in recognizing that monogamy is practiced in the west by law and economic necessityfor there are many nonchristians in the west who marry one wife furthermore the bible does not incidentally condemn polygamy as evil he could have said for example that jesus christ advocated love as primary above all other considerations as one man cannot divide his love in the same way he cannot satisfactorily serve two masters it would be a travesty of the word to marry many wives pretending that he could possibly love them equally and well this is only a suggestion but the fact remains that he was preaching pure western civilization and not christian ethics the distance between western civilization and christianity today is not clearly defined i think this accounts for most of the difficulties in getting it across to nonwestern people another reason why the missionary finds it difficult to get his message across is that he goes into africa to occupy a managerial position train people and walk out of the job here my own view on mission work has been sharply opposed especially by africans most africans feel that missionaries should not go into africa to stay but to train them to be entirely independent and leave because the missionary has to be strict and firm in dealing with people if he is to accomplish anything he is regarded more or less like his political counterpart who must be obeyed who  must rule and discipline people in order to get things done this places him in a predicament for he must use some measure of power as any leader must to fulfill his mission and those who are ruled do not usually take kindly to leaders who are strict the result is people who would rather leave the church and the mission if they disagree with the policy of a particular missionary leader like those who would leave their country when they dont like the president people who would say we need you only for your money and service but when we can take care of ourselves you should be gone in my own seventeen years of experience with the missionaries i have known them principally as leaders and because i have never lived as they expect me to i had to sustain punishments and disciplines of many kinds most of those i know who have gone through such years could not forgive them more than  of those trained in the lutheran missions in liberia for instance have left the mission and the church to work for the government or some other institution of course we have to admit because they are human some missionaries have not used their powev with discretion in fact many of them never intended for the africans to be leadersa lot of improvement is now made in this direction with the rise of nationalism in africa and so we still look to the missionaries as masters some of these masters have long lived with the illusion that the africans must have a limited education in order to keep them subservient these missionaries do not want africans to think for themselves or meet them face to face as equals they build palaces among huts and forbid natives from entering into them new arrivals who begin to show an unrestrained delight in the natives are advised to be cautious in their dealings with them ive seen some missionaries who admit that they really dont like negroes their reason for being in africa wouldnt be anything other than to express the desire which is becoming a major problem for all of us nowadays to be somewhere else to go away from something and not for something when one talks about equality they think you want their money or houses or cars i would even be right to want these things because such would declare to the world that all the money put into mission work is mainly to help the poor helpless africans without saying that over half of it is for the missionaries convenience they of course would say this is necessary to keep them in africa but it is still true that they are using most of the money for themselves money collected in the name of the africans when i came to america nearly every american lutheran i met thought that he was paying for the very air i breathed the missionary in liberia would say that he cant feed us with spoons forever that is true but then why cant he be true to himself by saying that most of the money from his home is really for him and not us however i dont want their cars or housesfor i believe whatever one gets freely no matter how he got it is a stolen good until he pays the full price with his own effort or money so long as the moneyor some of itstill comes from their home the masters believe that they are in africa to be in control of everything and if they make an african a leader he is only their puppet even some of the few leaders they trained have no more than a grade school education and so must depend on them for any decision thousands of africans are therefore saying that this is pure imperialism imperialism however is too powerful a word because the missionaries unlike their political counterpart have not been working simply for profit this to me is the real reason for the lack of progress in mission work although missionaries are quick to attribute it to the fact that africans are animists for success in mission work those engaged in it must reckon with this fact missionaries should not go merely to direct manipulate and rule people but to live and work with them in love and equality here the peace corp program impresses me most the peace corps worker does not go out merely as a leader but as one who is willing to work with people as equals work where he is needed most if one does not work on this basis if one does not work in love and equality he is laboring for his own gloryin theological terms laboring under a curse i look for the missionary who would go out to work and live with people as equals in spite of the many differences in education social standards and economy this i believe will promote universal christian brotherhood or at least begin to promote it for this reason christian mission work should never end the christian missionaries in africa would represent christians in america and bear witness to the fact that christians all over the world are working together as brothers this would even promote international understanding and peace on earth this is what most africans dont want because they have always known missionaries as masters and the quicker the masters leave the better but it would be using them as a means to an end which is very unfairfor people are ends in themselves another important factor we must consider is that missionaries if they want to succeed in their mission must be themselves they are not going into africa to be africans or make people americans they can be united with africans in christ and not in culture it is becoming fashionable these days in the lutheran mission in liberia for example i mention lutherans often because i know them best other denominations could be mentioned in this category to take an african name wear african clothes and live like africans in some ways they have the right to do this out of curiosity but they have to make it clear that they cannot be africans and this does not mean that they despise africans the africans themselves must understand this when missionaries begin to show curiosity in their cultures the africans begin acting towards them as africans when the africans go to a point of no more advance they feel betrayed the missionary is going for a special mission like teaching or preaching or medicating and if he can fulfill this as best possible expressing love and respect for the people hes dealing with he has redeemed his pledge you dont have to be an american before you learn to love americans and vice versa missionaries must also report about the progress africans are making and not merely talk about their problems in order to raise funds africans are right when they become sensitive to the fact that their poverty ignorance and disease are reported more frequently than the tremendous progress they are making it would be unfair to tell the story of america in terms of what is happening today in alabama because it is always unfair to tell about the problems of people mentioning little or nothing at all about their progress the fact that we all have problems should make us more sympathetic make us love and appreciate one another more i realize that much of what ive said might not coincide with the popular imagination this essay is not a testimony of hate or bitterness i am deeply concerned about mission work and it pains me to see those receiving or giving these services taking unnecessary risks that are responsible for holding back its progress i have not raised all the questions or given all the answers my intent is that everyone concerned will begin thinking seriously in order that some of the dangers might be removed as much as that is possible the human element remains no matter what we do although certain failures have reduced goodness in man quite remarkably i still have confidence in mans capacity for clear thinking and righteous action love is the only hope for the removal of the dangers it was st paul who said that no matter what you do without love there is no gain in love we have to perform the greatest sacrifices for one another it is then and only then that we can hope and indeed expect to make progress in mission work and other undertakings designed to promote universal peace and brotherhood

since the long hot summer exploded last august it has been impossible not to think of these things to have seen both the mime troupes ministrel show and leroi jones dutchman and the toilet on the same weekend was almost too much on one level the function of art whether it be jazz or poetry music drama or literature is always to help us to see and i can think of no better example of this truth than the blindness of the reaction to jones to the baldwin essays and to the minstrel show the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose baldwin wrote in the prophetic the fire next time leroi jones collection of angry animalistic teenagers in the toilet brings this to life the shocking thing is not the brutality but that a play which is so much a slice of reality should shock that set the boys room of a high school sordidly realistic wrecked by minority hatreds angry outbreak is the toilet of some high school we have all driven by its as simple as that to avoid looking at this lesson and learning from it because of false modesty about language is hypocrisy laid upon hypocrisy what word is used in that play that one has not heard before and survived curiously the realism is flawed the graffiti which exists on the walls of every unattended mens room in the country is strangely absent from the toilet though the actors use the words on stage no this play is real its mission high school in a sense just as dutchman is the jazz workshop andor north beach nothing in these plays is new but there are plenty of viewers to whom it is new itself no slight commentary the tragedy is in the attitude of the critics and censors who like chief parker in los angeles end up supporting the system which produced this frightening reality parkers remark were on top theyre on the bottom during the rioting will haunt him the rest of his life the minstrel show is another thing altogether it is neither shocking nor particularly instructive except that its another in the opportunities for black and white to laugh at each other together which is good it set out to be revolutionary theater and ended up great entertainment a lot of fun and more proof ronnie davis is a brilliant director it has however no point of view and really says nothing which marks it from all the other mime troupe productions baldwin and jones are telling us the building is going to blow up it is foolish if not tragic to allow shock at the form of that announcement to blind us to the reality of the danger all caucasians should see leroi jones plays they tell it like it is just as the jazzmen have for decades we need to listen and to understand their message nothing is more imperative reprinted from the san francisco chronicle
needed a negro film movement 
by walter moore
he cinema first of all  rip g is an art it is a great art capable of utilizing  mrs rvr its unrivaled technical superiority to convey ideas it is a unique art capable of illuminating the imagination of the spectator as well as making a profound imprint upon the concepts of the human conscious the great works of literature are transformed from lifeless white paper and black ink to be projected upon the motion screen as a living visual expression theatrical dramas are liberated from the narrow confines of the stage and indeed the world becomes a stage thus it can be said without a doubt that the cinema is of profound significance and is the greatest medium of expression in our modern technological society knowing these vast and vital benefits of the cinema it is disturbing to say the least that the negrohas made absolutely no creative contribution to this art it is a fact that while the peoples of asia and latin america have for years now been creating films there has not been one film made by negroes whether in africa the united states or the caribbean that is a film conceived written produced directed photographed and edited by negroes nigerian writer j koyinde vaughn adds further food for thought when he writes what attempts are being made to develop african cinema productions that will counteract decades of distortion future screen presentations of african life with the infinite possibilities of dramatizing both the past and african aspirations can only be successfully achieved by africans conscious of the great contribution we must make to the art of the cinema recently a short article published in negro digest asked why arent negroes in the business of making movies about themselves    why no negro movies why sammy davis jr answers this question simply and eloquently when he says that there are twenty negro groups who could put a whole studio togetherbut they want to build a chicken shack    instead of building a recreation center they build a church and gin mill but what would the reaction of audiences be to a negro cinema would it suffer the same fate as so many other negro endeavors this  would depend upon the quality content and the techniques of these films but a reasonable and logical conjecture would be that these films if wisely constructed would probably be highly successful both artistically and commercially for the whole world has learned to appreciate the genius of the negro as an artist of rhythmic and plastic expressions the whole world has learned to appreciate the genius of jazz and since the cinema is a combination of plastic and rhythmic images and because of the worlds acceptance and recognition of the negros genius in these respective fields of cultural expressions it is easy to believe that negro films could quickly capture world popularity and could even conceivably dwarf declining hollywood and the rest of the world film centers the negro film however can only be this successful if it is artistically and technically prepared to compete with other films a negro film movement would closely parallel the independent film movement in america and the world today for the era of the big hollywood studios is over in this unique sense hollywood is dead this is the new era of the independent film maker unshackled from the dominance of the large complexes the independent producers are turning out the great pictures today the best example of these independent film makers are the mirisch brothers a few months ago the mirisch company celebrated its fifth anniversary in that time according to press releases the company produced eighteen pictures ie the magnificent seven irma la douce grossed one hundred million dollars and won sixteen academy awards behind every success story lies a reasona need discovered and fulfilled there can be no doubt that there is a great need for films about negroes if for nothing more than that we exist in significant quantity in the mainstream of world society this is a need discovered there are within the context of american society over twenty million negroes who would like to see films portraying us as significant human beings projecting our personality to the world we need a negro cinema which is capable of illustrating profoundly what we were what we are and what we are capable of becoming a negro cinema which would produce films which the white man would not and could not create honestly all we need do now is fulfill this need thus far i have stated the great need for a negro film movement but i havent offered any suggestions of how best to create one for besides being an art the cinema requires certain unique and specialized skills peculiar to the cinema again unlike an authors pen and paper or an artists oils and canvas the cost of producing a film is not negligible large sums of money must be invested even before the cameras began to turn this matter of economics accounts largely for the lack of a negro cinema the negro digest january  main reason however is a lack of interest and our chronic dependence upon the white man to overcome this glaring obstacle interest in such a project must be motivated there should be formed a group of people with a deep interest in the cinema and a strong desire in spite of the many obstacles to see their dreams one day realized this group could seek out interesting ideas and topics to film discover talented negro thespians writers directors cinematographers and technicians it should then seek to secure financial backing in an attempt to turn out reputable films once the group establishes itself as being truly cinematic it could thus expand itself gradually to the point where it could turn out several feature length films annually if the group is recognized as turning out good quality films it will find itself in an easy position to secure financial backing to produce even more and better films thus this group could begin modestly and gradually rise to the position of turning out full length features of high merits and refined taste the rate of growth of this company would depend upon one thingthe quality of the films this is determined by the abilities of the artists and technicians skills and talent will attract the necessary financial backing it must also be understood that to produce a feature length film it is not absolutely necessary to have the multitude of technicians that are used on a hollywood sound stage this is only being eccentricit is a luxury rather than a necessity ingmar bergman uses only  or  technicians in creating his outstanding films therefore the first step is to lay a foundation by discovering negroes who have an aptitude for the cinema and a burning desire to create films and a great new art movement would then be borne the negro people who have so much to say to the world who have a great wealth of folklore and history will have at last realized and put to use the greatest medium of expression to tell a great storythe story of the negro we should act now a negro cinema is desperately needed for the millions of black peoples in america africa and latin america who would like to see realistic portrayals of themselves upon the motion picture screens of the world

have not had many opportunities to talk to r great men and most of those occasions came to nothing either i would meet them as i was in a line of wellwishers and would be elbowed out of the way by the next person in line or after they had dropped a few perfunctory commonplaces upon me they would be swept to tea or cocktails by important people with m b tolson however it was different one night poetsculptor oliver lagrone telephoned me that tolson was in town and invited me to come and meet him i found him to be as langston hughes has described him a man who can talk to students cottonpickers and cowpunchers a great talkera very warm and human person with his bald head fringed by gray tufts over his ears and his seamed smiling face he looked like an oldfashioned preacher when he settled back in his chair took a cigar in his right hand and a glass in his left and remarked that tonight he would forget about jim crow and concentrate on old crow we knew that we were in for a night of good talk inasmuch as many critics have hailed him as a great poet but none has mentioned his supremacy as a talker i amgoing to enlarge on this aspect of his talent his style is expansive this may come from his many years at wiley and langston as a college professor with a captive audience or it may spring from his natural tendency to expatiate both his prizewinning dark symphony and his libretto for the republic of liberia are long poems and his page harlem gallery is only part one of a projected poem in four parts he is not a poet given to short swallow flights of song he never cuts through the bam when it is possible to stroll around it but during his walk around the barn he dispenses treasures of observation learning and humor culled from vast experience and reading an example of his indirect method as well as his socratic method of teaching by questioning is his anecdote about a white northern club woman who was distressed because a southern member of her club asserted that negroes steal chickens instead of abruptly denying this tolson asked did you ever see movies of a southern mansion with a huge dining hall and chandeliers and a linencovered table where old colonel sat to dinner with his family yes she answered and did you see a black butler in a white coat bringing in a platter of fried chicken balanced high in the air with one hand yes well black sam served the chicken and who cooked the chicken his wife i guess yes black mandy sweated over the stove to cook the chicken and who fed and watered and took care of the chicken his daughter i suppose yes little cindy raised that chicken and who grew the com and crops that fattened the chicken so the colonel could eat it the butlers son yes black junior toiling in the fields raised the corn to fatten that chicken but who ate the chicken by this time the clubwoman had begun to see the point and was smiling the colonel of course yes the colonel ate that chicken but somewhere on that plantation was a black patrick henry who said give me liberty or give me chicken now did the colonel give him his liberty no the woman answered with a smile then as tolson described with mockfreudian symbols how the slave captured the hen by tickling its rump with a long pole the woman shook with laughter and he says she was never again disturbed by the southern womans allegations that negroes stole chickens tolson could have answered her simply by saying that this was compensation for economic and social exploitation but instead of using the abstract jargon of the sociologist he dramatized the situation with the invention and humor of the poet another characteristic of his talk is his ability to adjust it to his audience i heard him on two occasions once when he was with a group of young poets and again when he was in a group of nonwriters on the first occasion he acted as a catalyst advising the poets to study and revise demonstrating for those who thought knowledge of technique would destroy their spontaneity that it would make their work stronger showing those who thought that they could not improve their first inspirations that they could make them better telling those pressed for time to write that he worked after midnight in the company of cats and owls admonishing them that poetry was performance and not propaganda he told many literary anecdotes he said the critic v f calverton praised him as having the potential of becoming the greatest negro poet tolson was nonplused and said you flatter me calverton replied why in hell should i flatter you tolson said that at breadloaf writers conference saul bellow called him subversive because the young poets would bring beer and hamburgers to his cottage at night and would sit on the floor listening to his anecdotes until the small hours and would oversleep and miss their sessions the next day tolson related that after com pleting libretto for the republic of liberia he asked allen tate to write a preface for it and tate replied that he wasnt interested in the propaganda of negro poets tolson spent a year studying modern poetic techniques and rewriting the poem so that it said the same things in a different way and then sent it to tate tate wrote a preface in which he said for the first time it seems to me a negro poet has assimilated the full poetic language of his time    if the first version of the poem still exists it would be interesting to see it in a variorum edition with the rewritten version and to compare them one of the poets who was present that night wrote ill never forget mr tolsons marvelous mind and simple humility and absolute integrity tolson is modest about his achievements he admits that he began as a mediocre poet but developed his art by learning and experimenting he says that dark symphony is a good poem but not a great one at a lecture he read his poem my soul and i and after the applause had died down startled the audience by saying that was a bad poem you shouldnt have applauded he proceeded to analyze the poem  phrase by phrase and line by line explaining where and how it was bad and how he had improved it by revision with the second nonwriting group tolsons talk was entirely different he did not refer to poetry at all except to remark that perhaps the reason he was unknown among his own people was that when white people want to hide something from negroes they put it in a book or a magazine since his host was a graduate of wiley college where tolson had taught and had coached the debating team he reminisced upon his experiences there he told of taking the team to the university of southern california and scouting the speech department which was as large as all of wiley college when he got back the team asked about their opponents and wanted to visit the campus he told them theyre not so much well visit them after we win the debate just to show them were good sports little wiley college won the debate tolson has great gusto as a talker the night  met him lagrone and i left early as he was convalescing from a major operation but we found out later that he had learned that james farmer one of his students was in detroit and telephoning until he located him he had gone out and spent the night in talk and had not returned to his sisters home until five oclock the next morning at his home in langston oklahoma he formed a zulu club like the zulu club wits in harlem gallery where men meet to discuss and exchange ideas chapters have been formed in various cities across the country they are composed of men of all occupations from professional men to laborersanyone who is interested in reading thinking and exchanging ideas in his conversation he hints of some day writing his autobiography the life and times of m b tolson retired now from his position at langston university he occupies a newly created chair in humanities at tuskegee institute with only one class to teach it will be profitable if he can use his newfound leisure not only to complete harlem gallery but also to write his memoirs as they should be invaluable for the humor the recollections of literary figures and the record of the poetic development of this gifted poet and raconteur  
karens spring
by eloise greenfield
maren splashed the §§ suds listlessly over the m dishes humming h cheerfully for the ss benefit of larry who was reading in the living room she wondered that she had been able to fool him these past weeks he always recognized the symptoms of her doldrums and it was part of their closeness that he waited until she was ready to tell him the reasons and she always did but this time she couldnt she couldnt say to him i dont want our baby  our baby that weve talked about and planned for these last eight monthsand even before she looked out at the perky april greens and pinks and yellows but felt only weariness she used her arm to push a black curl back from her forehead just last month she had felt at one with spring had felt the joyousness they shared of life within preparing to bloom karen and phyllis her friend who lived in the apartment across the hall had spent the winter happily comparing prenatal progress and exchanging books on baby care and looking forward to this special spring  i counted twelve blades of grass and seven leaves on the way to the store phyllis had come by to tell her one day in early march spring karen had sighed and they had grinned proudly as if personally responsible for the birth of the new season but now she hated spring and she hated blond blueeyed phyllis whose baby would be born into a world of open doors and welcoming arms while restrictions and insinuations conflict and frustration would be waiting for her brown one karen loved the negro colors the golds the blacks the subtle shadings of tan the photograph or painting of a face evoked in her a strong sense of identification an almost physical leaning toward the likeness of her people she loved the full expressive lips which reflected in the men and women the depth of their feelings and in the children the sweet petulance found in all children but how could she bring something she loved into a world of so little love each morning for the past three weeks karen had awakened with a guilty feeling and the thought today ill visit phyllis but each hour came and went with the excuse that it was too early or too late she was too busy or tired or outofsorts the prospect of listening once more to the confident plans phyllis had made for the babys future was more than she could bear and now with phyllis almost a week overdue she still hadnt seen her «   it was hard for her to face this new hostility in herself she didnt want to hurt phyllis and she did want to hurt phyllis she felt that she could stand by and watch with grim glee as phyllis plans fell through one by one and it was with horror that she realized the strength of this emotion shed been angry before of course but it had always been directed at them the conglomerate them who greeted her coldly in the department stores who on television questioned her right to live fully who used her for political power was it the deeply protective feeling she had for the child inside her she wondered that had intensified and personalized this anger so that now when she most needed to be warm and loving she had become almost inhuman she thought back to her own mother love is all thats needed karen she had said love and forgiveness karen picked up the terry cloth towel and began to dry the dishes i hope its a girl she thought its the men who have it the hardest karen larry called from the living room the firmness of his voice sent a nervous ripple through her stomach and the baby kicked once as if in protest ill be through in a minute she answered she dried the last plate and slowly closed the door of the paneled cabinet okay now larry said taking her hand as she sat down beside him what is it what is what karen asked brightly youve been upset for weeks i havent bothered you before because i knew youd tell me but you havent larry theres nothing wrong with me she insisted and saw the hurt start around his mouth rise to his eyes and change suddenly to anger you dont eat he said in a hard voice you constantly hum those same three notes you havent been to see phyllis   all right karen interrupted ill visit phyllis if itll make you happy she slammed out of the apartment to escape his hurt and the questions    across the hall she paused at phyllis door before knocking wondering how she should explain her prolonged absence hi karen come on in phyllis said dully and karen could see that she had been crying karen looked toward the bedroom as she took the chair by the window is bob home she asked not yet phyllis answered hes working late tonight she lowered herself carefully onto the sofa howve you been karen asked she realized with a shock that during the time she had been avoiding phyllis phyllis hadnt visited her either just fine except ive been in an awful mood i didnt want to inflict on you she gasped suddenly and gripped the arm of the sofa youre in labor karen said rushing to her no no im not phyllis said bursting into tears but you are phyllis whats the matter with you have you phoned bob no i cant i dont want the baby phyllis said hysterically releasing her grip on the sofa karen stared at her you dont dont you see karen its cruel to bring a baby into a world like this to grow up in a world of wars and murders and hate and    maybe itll be better for our children karen said realizing the inadequacy of her words but desperate to convince phyllis before the baby arrived that she really did want him it was suddenly very important to her that his birth be an experience of joy and wonder and not of resignation how can it be phyllis asked calmer now but with hopelessness whos going to make it better we will karen said as much to herself as to phyllis well make it a better world well write letters see our congressmen well join other people who are doing things she got phyllis bag from the bedroom and set it down near the door you and i have wasted nine whole months dreaming and drooling karen continued preparing a room a layette a crib but not a wrorld in which our children can live love is not enough we have to work too now call bob and tell him to meet you at the hospital ill get larry to take you karen phyllis called as karen started back to her own apartment thanks thank you karen said silently thank you phyllis  
judahs a twoway street running out
by jack burris
lay looked up from the newspaper when the figure passed recognized it as a woman from his neighborhood and started to smile but then he saw the ice in her eyes remembered he was a cityboy now and reraised the newspaper thats the trouble with them niggers he thought addressing to himself the words he had so often heard spoken about himself and others they dont stick together aint got no gumption less you wave a relief check at em who me boss he answered his own charges amused by the game now that he no longer had to play it heck boss not me all  wants to do is sit here in the back of the bus and ride out to judah street so i can get me a job thats all  want honest boss then ill go home and eat my watermelon and dance in the mud and sing my happy songs for you and then maybe tonight ill poke a pickaninny up the old lady if she aint too tired from scrubbin yore floors an  stealin yore food honest boss thats all i want except that wasnt all he wanted and they would spot the lie quickly enough and bring him to account or maybe not maybe this time they wouldnt or maybe they wouldnt even care that card was due to come up too claire mae had promised the least he could do for her was sit there in the back of the bus and ride it out even to the last stop if he had to go that far only he wasnt really on the back of the bus of course he was sitting in the front seat of a streetcar where he always sat or at least as often as he reasonably could claire mae had teased him about it had asked him if he thought he was proving something to somebody and he had answered that the only thing it proved was they were living in san francisco now and he supposed any blackass fool could tell that quickly enough just by looking out the window he still sat at the front of buses though knowing that there would be time enough later for indifference looking through the hairoil smeared window he carefully checked the address given in the newspaper against those painted on the windows of the stores they were passing two more blocks he decided and lifted his arm preparing to pull the cord that would signal his desire to stop he hesitated though not knowing exactly where the streetcars next stop was and not wanting in his eagerness to be forced to walk those last two blocks just because hed signalled too early while he waited undecided he felt the cord sliding through his slippery fingers and heard the bell tinkle in front of him surprised and even mildly disappointed he stood up immediately and walked toward the doors at the back even though he had to fight against several people who were forcing their way to the front theres time enough for me to do that later too he thought pausing to let an old woman step before him today im going to obey all them dumb ofays rules stepping down he quickly spotted the building in the next block that was his destination claire mae had described it well that morning just as she had carefully described the whole neighborhood for him she had done so partially to avoid his getting lost again as he had done when he first went downtown to look for work but he knew her detailed description had also come from her nervousness her unspoken desperation hed spotted that quickly right at the start when shed looked up from ironing his shirt and said in all seriousness youll recognize judah easily enough its a twoway street running out to the ocean hed wanted to stop her then to ask her mockingly how many ways the street ran when it came back from the ocean but she was too painfully intent to interrupt still too aware of the fact that it had been at her suggestion that they had moved to san francisco back to the city of her childhood anyway it was because san francisco was her city that he had been willing to listen too grateful for any information she might offer however humorously expressed to risk losing it and the security it might later give him one thing you can say about me i never tease the hand thats feeding me no sir not me boss thinking about hands he took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his own hands while he was walking look ma look how good you taught me he thought remembering now without any real resentment how his mother had told him to always wipe his hand on the inside of his pocket before shaking hands with a white man she hadnt said it in words but she made him understand that even a simple thing like sweat which on another white man would be ignored on him would be magnified once after shed died and before claire mae had found him hed worn pocketless pants carefully cutting the right front pocket out of each new pair that he bought willingly sacrificing the convenience for the sake of the joke but that was before claire mae she wouldnt see anything funny in it at least not as long as she was working in a white mans house every day to pay for those pants so now he left the pockets in and carefully wiped his hands  on a handkerchief lo how the mighty has fallen the door was locked when he tried it he gave it a second try to make sure then checked his watch the ad had said ten oclock so he had almost twenty minutes to wait he considered going to search for a coffee shop but then balanced that against the impression he might give if he were standing there when the owner arrived yes suh boss ahs always early yes suh and no cavities either he decided instead to have a cigarette even though there were only five left in the pack and they had to last the day he was still standing there in the doorway enjoying the smoke and the warmth of the early sun when he saw the other man approaching he recognized the man as a neighbor of sorts in that he lived somewhere in the same overfilled apartment building clay had seen him sometimes when he was climbing the stairs or emptying the garbage and the man usually dressed up as though for saturday night would pass silently by their eyes always failing to make contact it wasnt that the man was unfriendly he knew but simply that in that house the only privacy to be had was in refusing to recognize people maybe you had to listen to your neighbors television and kids and fights and screwings but you didnt have to recognize those neighbors when you saw them not even in broad daylight on the stairs the man had stopped looked first at the address on the door then at clay and finally nodded hi man hi clay answered smiling and offered his hand im clay carter live on the third floor back apartment the man nodded again and gave him a smile in return clay noticed the mishapen goldcapped teeth thought i recognized you im william potter only call me billy like in goat im staying with my sister and her old man up on the top floor he smiled again this time without the show of teeth only i wont be tomorrow less something turns up clay nodded this time then watched as the man lit a cigarette hed already noticed the mans frayed shirt dirty at the neck and the lack of a crease in the trousers of his black suit been looking long four months billy said before that i had unemployment so i took it easy man i didnt know when i was well off i had this job deliverin diapers see only i didnt think it was good enough not for a college man so i quit hell i had to learn now man id pick up them dirty diapers with my teeth theyd let me this is only my second month clay said but i know what you mean i got a wife working so i guess it aint as bad but were just  gettin started out here so far it aint been much of a start man dont you worry none aint you heard about the presedents new bill he gets that passed man were gonna have rights up the ass wont even have to work just go pick us some money off that moneytree marked niggers only sure only watch out for the man hes behind that tree somewhere and hes got him a shaft marked niggers only too dont you believe that man why i heard govnor wallace just last night said them dirty coonsll be pickin the money and the white folksll have to pick the cotton aint that a shame man i cried all night clay laughed enjoying his new friends gestures as much as the words wonder who theyll burn their crosses for then why them dirty commies of course theyre the ones startin all this fuss anyway them cottonpickin niggers wasnt causin no trouble until them yankee commies started in i thought the niggers and the commies were one and the same no billy said theyre different them commies are sort of bleachedout niggers see didnt you hear about dr dejone hes the head of the science department down there at good old georgia u or someplace like that and he wrote this book provin that all commies are just washedout niggers something about the curse of god and ham and small heads i didnt read all of it but it was something like that clay flicked the butt of his cigarette out over a parked car and into the street he checked his watch saw that they still had almost five minutes to wait and leaned back against the wall of the building billy was trying to look through the window cupping his hands around his eyes to shut out the outside light i think theres somebody in there must of come in the back door clay said you think we have much of a chance yeah man the best aint we niggers man and aint this old niggerlovin san francisco hell soon as that old white boss looks at us hes gonna say coons youre both hired  clay laughed trying to hide his nervousness i guess we can always threaten to picket them picket hell im gonna tell them if i dont get this job ill have old buddy marty come in and pray for them hey watch out man here comes that little old white chick to let us in um um wouldnt my brother like a piece of that the secretary who had let them into the office also explained to them that mr robertson would be a little late and then helped them fill out the application forms then when these were completed she showed them two chairs where they could wait at first clay had found  her attractive but the more she talked in her phony dead voice the more he lost interest he was grateful to her for her kindness but he wondered how soon he would hate her if he had to work in the same office dont worry about that man you aint got the job yet although she had given them some magazines to look at while they waited clay couldnt get interested in them instead he watched the men moving back and forth in the back part of the office he noticed that there were no negroes but he couldnt decide if that were a blessing or a curse maybe they would hire him just to prove their tolerance but on the other hand maybe they were planning to wait until they absolutely had to before they gave in three other men all of them white had come in since he had been sitting and the secretary was helping them through the problems of the application forms clay watched them closely trying to balance his own qualifications against theirs they were obviously in less dire needotherwise they couldnt have afforded such clothingbut he refused to think about that for long having given up the idea of poeticjustice along with his diapers he overheard them listing some of their qualifications but not enough to influence him one way or the other he finally gave up the game concluding only that two of them might give him some serious competition the third man who was still a pimplescarred youth he threw into the reject file in his mind where he had much earlier placed billy potter mr carter clay tried to locate the source of the voice turning his head slightly he saw a large middleaged man in a grey doublebreasted business suit he was holding an application form and clay recognized it as his own yes sir clay answered quickly standing up and moving toward the man im mr robertson the man said offering his hand oh sorry mama but this cat aint goin to give me no time for wipin okay ofay have some sweet sweat how do you do sir would you come this way please clay followed him the office door had the name mr abraham robertson printed on it in gold lettering abraham huh like from the bible well abraham i aint your isaac so dont go gettin no ideas i done played that game abe all my life honest abe l just want a job honest abe clay sat down on the edge of the politelyoffered chair refused the cigarette that he needed so badly his mouth watered at its sight and smiled thanking god that there werent any gold caps on his teeth mr robertson pretended a fascination with the application form letting him cool his heels clay supposed hey you dumb ass im over here not on that piece of paper the message must have been received for mr robertson looked up startled i see you have an ma yes sir you realize of course that the job which is open doesnt require that kind of ability its only an accounting position yes sir i know that but i thought that perhaps it would be a good place for me to start the ofay smiled youre not too humble to start at the bottom dont give me that jazz man you want me to clean your toilets for openers show me the brush no sir to be quite frank i need a job ive only recently moved to san francisco from the south and im finding it a little difficult to get started is that begging mama okay so now im a beggar next week  start peddlin the dope yes i see that on your application form i dont recognize your college mr carter its a negro college in alabama sir oh clay felt the irritation rising in him like an erection hard against his gut  oh is that all its going to be white man just oh one little word not even of sympathy but merely indifference and then the door you think  wanted to go to that friggin little school you think i couldnt have made it at harvard if vd had the chance his fingernails cutting into his palms brought him back in time to realize he had missed a question i beg your pardon sir i asked if what youve listed here is your total work experience yes sir it is you see i only finished college last year and then we moved out here oh yes i see four words this time but they amounted to the same clay couldnt even feel the irritation now it had dissolved blending with a thousand past irritations leaving him with only a sour taste in his mouth the interview was over he knew and he was out as usual now all that was left was the long ride to the end of the line that long ride he had to take for claire mae not for himself because he already knew yes sir he said quickly answering another useless question yes sir mr robertson yes sir you are absolutely right capn only come on daddy dont drag it out kill me quick abe aint no sense messin around aint gonna be no savin message from god this time when he phoned claire mae from the bar later she took the news pretty hard she didnt agree with him as she usually didbut you dont know yet clay not reallynor did she bother asking him what he was doing in a bar  when he could be looking for work in other places she just said all right as though it was a kind of vocal shrug and then said shed see him that night when she finally came home though she was feeling better evidently her work that afternoon had smoothed away the edge of her disappointment just as the liquor had smoothed away his because she listened patiently to the details of his explanation then embraced him and said it doesnt matter hon somethingll turn up tomorrow maybe right here in fillmore cant every boss in this city be a white twofaced bastard she fixed him a steak for dinner singing all the time she was cooking to show him she still had faith and while they ate they talked confidently of the future of the house they would someday buy and the children they would raise and the trips they would take and if anybody can make it all happen  guess claire mae can he thought smiling inwardly at the strength of her determination when they were watching television the newscaster mentioned that the presidents civil_rights bill was having trouble in the house but that it still seemed a sure thing to pass he felt claire mae touch his arm while the man was talking but whether it was to give him confidence or to seek some from him he couldnt determine they sat  there huddled together as though for protection while the little white men danced in blackandwhite before them laughing together when the occasional lone negro passed by in the background they can hire me for show too if they want if  aint black enough for them ill even put on a little mantan claire mae as though sensing his thoughts leaned against him he unbuttoned her blouse and rested his hand beneath it when she didnt pull away he started working on the bra as well clay there was no warning note in her voice only a kind of questioning yeah i thought you wanted to watch this show screw that show lets go to bed she sat upright then forcing his hand away but she was smiling i aint done the dishes yet screw them too she laughed man you do all that screwing you aint going to be much use to me you try me he said reaching again for her she caught his hand and kissed it i got to get that kitchen cleared up first them cockroachesll carry the whole house off if i dont and i need me a bath too you hintin at something me course not makes sense though that if you took care of the kitchen while i was taking me a bath wed both get to that bed faster dont it he lunged for her laughing but she beat him again jumping up and heading for the bathroom you aint out of that tub time i get ready im climbin in with you he yelled after her she paused long enough to give him a smile then disappeared behind the bathroom door clay turned the television off finding some consolation in shutting up some stupid ofay right in the middle of a sentence the kitchen really wasnt too bad there were only a few dishes on the table to clear away he knew there wouldnt be enough hot water to wash them since claire mae was running it for a bath and so he only wiped at them the best he could he heard her singing in the tub and he tried to hum the tune along with her as he worked but he heard himself go offkey and quit heres one nigger that cant carry a tune boss cant do much of anything else either seems like he was looking out the kitchen window and down onto the halflit street while he rinsed and stacked the dishes he saw the figure of a man get off the bus at the corner he thought it was billy porter but it wasnt until the man started to cross the street that he was sure hed forgotten about his neighbor just as hed forgotten the interview during the long drinking afternoon but now that he saw him again he wanted to talk with him if for no other reason than to compare notes on the mornings embarrassment he searched for some excuse saw the sack of garbage heaped to the level of spilling and grabbing it rushed out into the hall he was too quick he heard billy just starting to climb the stairs as he dropped the bag down the chute and so he had to wait emptyhanded so maybe hell think im waiting for him i dont give a damn i am hell want to see me too only natural hes probably just as disappointed as i am and he doesnt have a wife fixing herself up just for his pleasure clay heard the song then the tune climbing up the stairway like an echo of the footsteps and it bothered him he heard in it not sadness not disappointment but a quiet joy of contentment what if he got the job the question rattled inside his head knocking aside all the old defenses spawning other questions in its flight what if billy the rejected of clay had been the accepted what would claire mae find to say in consolation then how could an ofay be a bastard if    clay clutched the end of the handrail and watched the figure of the man climbing like a black christ rising from a tomb to announcewhat what will he announce what new joyous disaster    the tune danced in the still air to the rhythm the footsteps beat out in warning no oh my god not that too the black face was first to reach the level of the hallway looking  like a dark moon against a pale horizon and as clay watched in fear the tiny internal smile spread broadly in recognition hi man hi clay answered forcing his voice to sound casual hey you sure sound happy enough hell why not i got me a job man so the drum warnings had been of doom and he hadnt prepared in time what did it matter though he had built the only defense he had the only kind he knew and if it wasnt enough    yeah hey thats great man i didnt think that dumb ofay could even see us niggers there in that dark office him mr robertson hell man he couldnt that aint where  got my job i got back on at the diaper factory clay laughed chasing the terrors away again by his sheer volume yeah hell i thought for a minute youd gotten the other job nah billie answered smiling he seemed puzzled by clays outburst hell i called them this afternoon pretended i was somebody new you know like i hadnt been there this morning they told me it was already filled they must have taken one of them dumb ofays that was standin there when we was there clay smiled finished with the topic now that he had found his fears to be groundless well im glad you got you a job anyway thanks it aint much but itll pay the rent they stood there quietly as though neither of them was sure how to break away clay looked past billy down the stairs looking intently at the door as though the outside world were waiting there like a puppy whimpering to be let in fog must be coming in he said i felt it a minute ago nah its clear out billy answered clear as a virgins conscience they shared a laugh and then clay shrugged must be me then i sure thought i felt it coming in billy didnt answer he stood quietly another moment still a few stairs from the top then started climbing again moving past clay well guess i better get on up that sister of mine may even feed me tonight she hears the news fore she starts thro win things okay man see you clay watched the back of his friend as he climbed the stairs on up to the next floor sharing with him for a moment a genuine pleasure for his new job tomorrow may be my turn he thought promising himself and claire mae or at least the next day its got to come sooner or later if we can only wait long enough the footsteps if they were an omen were fading fast now so they no longer seemed threatening they stopped a door opened and then closed quickly again clay smiled wiped his sweating hands down across his trousers and started back to his own apartment back to claire mae who he knew was still waiting in the dark and wide bed to give him comfort

rofessor roberts squinted at the top of his dresser finding he put made a tie his glasses on and  to j his y his pipe and stuflfed them in this pocket and  walked down the hall toward the stairs at the first landing the professor wiped the steam from the window with his hand and peered out it was a dark windy morning and the rain was beating heavily against the window usually on mornings such as this he savored the warmth the glowing lights and the breakfast aromas that permeated the house but this morning the weather vaguely registered in the professors mind for he was preoccupied with matters concerning the hatcher theory the professor entered the dining room and was disappointed to find it empty sitting down he brushed aside the morning paper and sipped his orange juice it was strange he thought for years he and his colleagues had laughed whenever anyone mentioned professor hatcher he remembered that when he first started teaching zoology one of the standard jokes in his lecture on genetics concerned hatchers theory it seems the professor mused that ol hatcher has had the last laugh he picked up the paper glanced at the headlines and put it down again say he called isnt there anyone in the house breakfast will be ready in a minute dear his wife called from the kitchen where are the kids theyve already gone to school the professor looked at his pocketwatch how do you like that he said to himself my great hour of triumph and theres no one around to help me celebrate again he picked up the paper and glanced at the front page his wife entered from the kitchen carrying a plate of eggs and a pot of steaming coffee good morning dear she said the professor looked up and smiled the kids left earlier than usual didnt they yes its quite bad out this morning and they had a chance to ride to school im sorry i missed them i wanted to talk to them this morning well thats a new one said his wife generally you just growl at them in the morning oh come now have i really been that bad the professors wife poured him a cup of coffee youve been a real grouch lately do you realize how long youve been working on this project its been quite a while now its been thirteen months the project was going along quite smoothly until you got the invitation to speak before the world congress ive hardly seen you at all since then i know emily its been hard on you and    im not thinking of myself jason youre going to ruin your health with this ridiculous pace youve set for yourself the nuclear destruction of the lost civilization has been a mystery for thousands of years surely the world can wait a few more years for the answer yes said the professor its just that i felt that some discovery would justify my being chosen over so many others to speak before the congress but you dont have to find anything new you were chosen for your past accomplishments well anyway said the professor it was worth the effort i have some astonishing news to announce the professors wife looked at him at amazement you mean youve discovered something the professor smiled yes he said we broke the code to their alphabet and finished the project about three oclock this morning most of the vestiges that we have so far are of little use to us but curiously enough that little plaque that we found in the southern part of the continent a couple of years ago has proved to be extremely valuable the one we found on our vacation said his wife excitedly tv right said the professor the paint on the plaque had contained leadpigment with the aid of chemicals we brought out the figures quite clearly last night we translated it and it read this entrance for white people only the professors wife drew a sharp breath the hatcher theory she said right again said the professor with this plaque and in view of previous findings we have conclusive proof of the theory presented by the late professor wilber hatcher a couple of thousand years ago probably around the twentieth century there was indeed a race of whiteskinned people on the earth professor roberts paused and continued this seems also to substantiate our theory that their cultural development did not keep pace with their scientific progress i would guess that our ancestors discriminated against these people simply because their skin was white  
pigmentation
by dr carl a larson
rouse life light must meet color in the sterile vastness of space where light meets light stars and planets roll empty and dead plants of our earthen soil and seas use pigments green and yellow and red to capture light and ¦ ¦ turn its energy to build sugars and compound foods for vegetable and animal life the minutest freeliving cell with a simple eyespot has pigment to receive light and elicit small voltages necessary for goaloriented motion without coloring matter or pigment life as we know it would be extremely poor or extinct then an intense and widespread interest in pigment is natural and selfexplaining an enlightened public thirsts for knowledge about the wonders and the hidden meaning of color in the course of human affairs facts from laboratories and the fields of observational research are grasped by the eager hands of men and women striving to bridge the gaps of fatal ignorance and group rancor well yes but a yes with a few shamefaced qualifications when it comes to human pigmentation interest grows worldwide indeed but the source of that interest is not always respectable or even presentable some people think they know a mans dreams his thoughts and his skills when they know his color we need not respect such delusive reasoning nevertheless whatever its source factual knowledge about the meaning of human diversity would help us see wherefrom we come and whereto we go we know much about blood pigments and gall pigments we understand a little about the part played by light absorption in the immense drama of life and so we could expect the widespread interest in skin pigmentation to have crystallized into some knowledge of gemlike clarity this is not the case we have a series of facts that is true but they admit of very limited conclusions when the origin and advantage of diversity in skin color are concerned the deviations from normal pigmentation have however long challenged the medical profession partial changes of hue especially in the face on the neck and arms meet little love today and in times past white spots in tan faces caused much alarm because they were frequently taken as signs of the dreaded and poorly understood lepra or leprosy now better called hansens disease to avoid derogatory associations the pigmented bearers of ancient civilizations indians and egyptians knew remedies against such depigmented spots thus atharva veda the sacred book of india from about  b c prescribed certain black seeds against white spots this sounds like magic likeness in color would transfer a property from the remedium to the patient but hints of early and accurate experience of successful treatment are provided by folklore and late observations to the former type of evidence belongs the ageold use in india and egypt of a plant ammi majus for the cure of white spots the roots of this plant were chewn and the effect in the form of pigmentation came forth after the exposure of the skin to sunlight now the active substance of the plant are known and used in treatment of the annoying spots the effect is often slow and irregular it is not free from dangers and should never be undertaken without medical advise and supervision the second pointer to experience behind the idea of swallowing something to cure a skin condition might be found in the observation of nutritional disturbances with loss of pigment now and then an observant medicine man might have come upon a drug that either ameliorated a malnutrition or seemed to have an effect because it happened to be taken together with the adequate food to illustrate in africa nutritional diseases with the local names buaki mbuaki and diboba go with loss of color here as well as in the more widelyknown kwashiorkor an unbalanced proteindefective diet lies at the root of the disease when the deficiency in the diet is corrected normal pigmentation returns this also applies to the sometimes observed pigmentary changes in vitamin a deficiency uneven pigmentation and loss of pigment are mere signs of unbalanced diet in such disorders today protein starvation sometimes masked by a relative abundance of carbohydrates is a great killer of infants and children and stealer of strength in adults in many young countries protein starvation results from a lopsided agriculture an analogous situation obtained in the southern part of the united states where pellagra was widespread until the late thirties and early forties when it virtually disappeared helped by an increased understanding of this niacinamid malnutrition the improved food supply eradicated the disease the depression made cotton unsaleable and acreage for diversified food production was freed a late result of pellagra in many darkhued people was a patchy blanching of the skin in pellagra in other nutritional deficiencies and in disorders of the skin with other origin more or less striking pigmentary changes in the opposite direction occur endocrine disorders such as addisons disease resulting from reduced function of the adrenal glands and the normal change of hormonal balance in pregnancy cause more or less visible more or less localized increase of pigmentation when a cured skin disease leaves a face permanently speckled it sometimes becomes a matter of preference whether the white spots shall be tanned or the brown spots blanched for the lastmentioned purpose specialists have begun using an industrial compound monobensylether of hydroquinone valued as an antioxidant prolonging the life and reducing the color of rubber with time patience and skilled supervision some good results have been obtained as for causes a series of inheritable disorders are associated with lack of pigment widely known among them is albinism its generalized form is marked by milkwhite skin and whitishyellow or white hair lifelong and painful sensitivity to light and decreased visual acuity resuit from lacking eye pigments when exposed to sunshine over long periods albinos get the sunproduced skin cancers which are extremely rare in pigmented people generalized albinism is caused by a mutant gene a changed piece of dna deoxyribonucleic acid that occurs in both chromosomes of a specific pair another mutant gene causes localized albinism when present in one chromosome only dominant inheritance as distinct from the recessive inheritance of generalized albinism localized forms show as piebaldness or white spotting and white forelock terms used to describe irregular or symmetrical narrow or wide spots of white skin in the face or limited to trunk arms and legs in some instances a circumscribed depigmentation takes only a tuft of hair a third gene situated in the x chromosome deprives the retina of pigment in men carrying this mutant gene half the number of their daughters will carry the gene being themselves normal but for dotting and stippling of the eye fundus with pigment  all human beings possess pigment cells called melanocytes distributed in the membranes of the brain in the eyes in the skin and mucous membranes and in the hair bulbs albinos are no exceptions but their melanocytes have lost their ability to produce pigment because they lack the enzyme tyrosinase the enzyme defect is not complete even in the generalized form of albinism it is limited to the white spots in partial albinism this partial or localized albinism can be more or less simulated by vitiligo or white spots with a mostly irregular distribution on trunk face and extremities though vitiligo often enough runs in families the mode of inheritance is obscured by similar conditions caused by environmental influences in another sense heredity may be at work when a cell and its descendants loose their enzyme production the forerunner of the melanocyte takes its origin in the primitive nervous system of the embryo from there nonpigmented cells migrate to the skin as observed with the electron microscope they contain minute grains loaded with the forerunner of the active enzyme these grains then mature to enveloped particles containing tyrosinase which converts the amino acid tyrosine to melanine the pigment of sun tanning and of ordinary hue in pigmented people normally all melanoblasts of an embryo carry the same genetic information if one of them undergoes mutation its descendant cells will carry the changed information and may give rise to pigmentpoor spots so much for abnormalities now to normal skin color and its fascinating quality of being divers it has become possible to study skin color objectively by use of the reflectance spectrophotometer an instrument that measures the percentage of light reflected from the skin at different wavelengths thus the degree of pigmentation is told in figures or in the form of a reflectance curve a skin of european type reflects  per cent of the light if this has a wavelength of  millimicrons and  per cent at  millimicrons for west africans the reflectance values at these two wavelengths are  and  these figures come from a recent work by harrison and owen in oxford england they studied the children and grandchildren of west africans with europeans and also the original population groups three or four chromosomes seemed to carry the chemical signals necessary to establish the observed pigmentary differences between west africans and europeans for our purpose this refined study mainly confirms the net results of earlier investigations the conclusions we can draw from these observations are two first pigmentation differences of the afroeuropean grade are inherited in a somewhat more complicated way than albinism and piebaldness the second conclusion leaves us  perhaps  chromosome pairsof the  not directly concerned with sexfree from perceptible engagement in pigment manufacture further we must not think that the three or four chromosome pairs that carry dna information for pigmentation carry nothing else for all we know each of them has safely hundreds and very likely thousands of bits of dna information regulating other characters because we do not know for certain that the essential primary information for pigmentation is limited to just three or four gene pairs which may well be the case some caution is necessary in drawing the conclusion but for all we know and can reasonably assume a very small proportion of the genetic material takes care of color then color is unimportant to the forces of survival that make us keep or loose genetic material possibly but we cannot draw that conclusion from the relative scarcity of genes for normal skin pigmentation blood pigment hemoglobin takes little primary genetic information we cannot do without it color as so many other traits takes its directives from a limited number of molecules with many jobs to do and much information to store but the sum of these other bits of genetic information which regulate our body build and our life processes overshadows pigment genes in general importance turning now to groups of people we know that the genes for the common blood groups a b and o can be differently distributed we do not expect the place where a man worships to influence his genes but we are not overly astonished to hear that as a group muslims in southeastern india carry the b gene in  per cent while their hindu neighbors have this gene in  per cent religion has kept the muslims together as a group for a very long time they have founded families with their neighbors too rarely to mingle with them into one population with a common gene pool in precisely the same way a group of heavily pigmented group in kongo will because each constitutes a group of people mostly marrying within this group conserve its own proportions of genes for blood groups and other universal traits thus pigment like religion can affect the genetic endowment of a group indirectly by isolation this isolation is relative only let us also remember that it makes no difference if a person gets his a blood group gene from his african or from his european parent in either case it fits the corresponding bit of dna he gets from his other parent with the matching chromosome this other bit may determine blood group a b or o though the fact of common blood groups seems trivial at least to blood doners it serves to remind us of our common ancestry we differ a little but not much in genetic setup from our forebearsthe early toolmakers and now to a nice piece of logic that some of us recognize as an evergreen we are civilized our manlike forebears were primitive they were darkhued therefore people who are still heavily pigmented are more primitive than lightly pigmented people isnt that logic yes it is logic of a sort scotsmen are stingy so is joe smith therefore joe smith is a scotsman thats the same sort of logic and it is false our early forebears were very likely pigmented if we go back far enough we meet other traits that are kept in some ethnic groups and have been lost in others when evolution became a fertilizer of scientific thought a hundred years ago it established a ladder of life higher forms evolved from lower and highest of all rose man the conclusion that all men share the same humble origin and all belong to the same advanced species which is true was not enough for some deep thinkers they went a few steps further and discovered a ladder of lower and higher races being men of wealth and comfort they also found that the wealthy and comfortably established were the fittest though these pseudoscientific ideas met some notable setbacks when applied to human affairs they have for three generations permeated the notions of wielders of power with their foggy plausibility while superior and inferior carry no real meaning in our context it could be worth while asking if pigmentation or a notable lack of skin pigmentation could be favorable in a specific surrounding in other words what adaptive advantage is connected with pigment on the surface the question seems easy enough we either are or become pigmented when exposed to strong sunlight pigment absorbs light and thus the deeper layers of the skin are protected from inflammation and blistering in central africa in australia and southern india people are heavily pigmented and thus protected against the sun the advantage of being pigmented would show in an increased chance of having a normalsized family when living in these regions this seems to make sense even if it tells far less than the whole story if we turn the question and ask for the relative advantage of europeantype pigmentation we could accept the idea of a pigmentpoor skin letting through more ultraviolet light to its deeper layers thereby facilitating the production of vitamin d when sunlight is sparse so various grades of pigmentation could have advantages in different geographic regions and during tens of thousands of years humanity would become dispersed over the earth according to sunlight and color this does not explain the emergence of pigmentpoor people from heavily pigmented ancestral tribes we shall take a look at this problem before returning to the so far sketchy discussion of geographic distribution of skin pigmentation one thing we know about the genes that form us and regulate our life processes is that soonor or later they change one type of such changes or mutations was exemplified by the gene for generalized albinism one fourth of the children of this mutant gene become albinos when albinos marry one another a rare event all their children are albinos were it not for the decreased chance of survival of albinos under all known natural conditions extremely pigmentpoor groups of people could arise in this way when african and european populations are concerned each of a few genes contributes in a way not yet known in details a minor amount of pigment let us assume that long ago somewhere in africa one of these genes changed to produce a just discernible lighter nuance a carrier of this new gene would leave it to half his children if their just perceptibly lighterhued children in turn founded families one fourth of their offspring would be still poorer in pigment to these carriers of one mutant gene in duplicate very strong sunlight might have been hurtful if they sought the shadow of the rain forest they might have come upon abundant food resources helping their kind to survive and multiply but at least two other genes had to change in order to produce a really light skin if one or two genes of a hundred thousand mutates it could take thousands of years before small flocks and scattered tribes produced these additional mutations in effective quantities once relatively lighthued men and women with different mutant genes for pigment loss met and founded families still lighter offspring would result and a white tribe could finally emerge this is how a group of pigmentpoor human beings could be formed over a long period of time through forces we are well acquainted with but how could such groups survive grow in number and spread over wide geographical regions in view of the intense popular interest in pigment we know remarkably little about the advantage and disadvantage of color gradations in the need for protection against strong sunlight would seem to fit the distribution of very lightly pigmented people in northern europe perceptibly darker but still lightly pigmented people in southern europe and northern africa and heavily pigmented people in equatorial africa but what about the americas on both subcontinents the original inhabitants are pigmented but relatively lightly so and without any decided tendency for equatorial tribes to be more heavily pigmented the northern regions of america and asia are inhabited by pigmented people we have to question even the simple and plausible exploration of pigment variation as adaptive to sunlight true enough everything can be explained the arctic sunglare gives the darkeyed hunter an advantage without his rich eye pigmentation his sight would be blurred and he could not easily detect his quarry if sun does not suffice to account for the heavy pigmentation in africa another explanation comes handy the deep shadows of the tropical rain forest would allow the dark hunter to come close to his prey while a milkwhite apparition would attract a ghastly interest from the leopard this seems reasonable but then we ask why the pygmy tribes babinga ako mawambi and other forest dwellers are in fact yellowishbrown not black in africa we meet the darkest people on the savannas where pigment no doubt protects against the scathing sunlight again the bushmen living in the kalahari desert are not much darker than many southeuropeans without denying the adaptive value of pigmentation we keep asking if relative advantages such as those mentioned could thousands of years ago have sufficed to split mankind into differently colored tribes and peoples we could add to the list of disadvantages of being too lightly pigmented under the tropical sun the sunprovoked skin cancer of the elderly though by far not preventing white people from settling in tropical regions could cause some disadvantage to the flock we have evidence that humanlike forerunners of our species kept some elderly members of their families presumably for some useful purpose a disease shortening the lives of the elderly more often in white than in pigmented flocks could increase the risk of succumbing to catastrophs where the experience of old people could have opened a trail to survival this is possible but as evidence such speculations look rather thin from the study of blood pigments in african populations we know that one and the same gene can cause both advantages and disadvantages balancing each other such forces keep a population heterogenous a minor additional advantage for a mutant gene will in a limited number of generations virtually eliminate its originally normal partner gene allele we cannot deny the possibility that shades of pigmentation have in different environments long ago caused distinct advantages we also have good reason to question the largescale effect of such advantages all the time we must take into account the additional facts of clothing and protective paint before the human race went manlike toolmakers used scrapestones and mussel shells to prepare hides for clothing we must not assume that our forebears just waited to be bleached or tanned by chance mutations before going where they wanted to go then let us face the fact that we do not know of any clear and decisive disadvantage shutting off a land to people with sparse pigment or advantage opening it to heavily pigmented people pigmentation may never have played a major part in adjustment to any environment another fact remains that of a few billion people roughly assortable in pigmented and white so what other forces than those of natural selection could produce very dark and very lightcolored peoples a major catastrophe such as flood plague or famine could by mere chance leave a handful of black men and women to repopulate one region they would leave no brown descendants under similar circumstances in other regions white survivors could happen to become the founders of a tribe similarly if a desert prevents a lightly colored flock from intercourse with its heavily pigmented neighbors it may grow to a tribe or a people with its own light color such forces of chance very likely have been at play in the past they are still at work through skeletal remains and implements found in the earth we know that human flocks were scattered over the earth tens of thousands of years ago the first europeans to leave remnants lived  years ago the first north americans  years ago thus flocks of a few families have had time to grow large and diverse before we met them in history mother africa had space and warmth enough for all her manycolored children but we may surmise that heavily colored girls preferred men of their own hue when it came to founding a family when migrant flocks met lightcolored young people found each other and the combinations of genes necessary for white hue were secured such mating selection helps establish groups with distinct color or relative lack of color in a limited number of generations it was probably the strongest single force in the emergence of pigmentation differences if in addition slight adaptive advantages long ago helped establish black tan and white in their diverse regions they gave mankind an increased chance to survive should white succumb in the frosty outskirts of the world tan might survive but thanks to human sagacity and mutual assistance all shades of color survived today pigment or lack of pigment has only one adaptive advantage that of group acceptance like it or not mankind is changing its shell like a lobster with the propagation of universal techniques and ideas goes a desire to identify the own group to shelter its traditions and characteristics we know nothing about future groups units in a harmonious global society or flocks of cave dwellers in a world gone to wrack but we have had the color variant and may have matured to new standards for group identification if we are bent to take the idea of changing shell more literally we can contemplate the fact that mankind grows a little richer in pigment every day more than two thirds of the increase in the world population is contributed by pigmented people our view into the past is veiled and our vision of the future is dim but we can feel confident that color never meant and never will mean so much to human kind as we make of it in our own moment of anguish and struggle ours is only a glimpse of the long drama of life if we are to catch a little of its hidden meaning we must try not to be blinded by the trivial and the apparent dr carl a larson author of pigmentation is a graduate of the university school of medicine of lund university in sweden since  dr larson has been a member of the staff of the institute of genetics at his alma mater heading the department of genetics dr larson has done research work in the fields of mental retardation and human genetics and lectured before international congresses he tells us that this article grew out of his concern over the discrepancy between the widespread interest in pigmentation and true knowledge about the functions of the pigment cell the december  issue of negro digest featured dr larsons article the supreme race in which he concluded that such a label could only be applied to the race of man
