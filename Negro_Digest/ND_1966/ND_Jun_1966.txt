memo to a nation
by ronald williams
nfortunately it u appears that little has been learned from the race riots of the summer of  the usual observations and comments have been made racial discrimination unemployment poor housing ignorance police brutality and poverty have all been cited as causes all of these deplorable conditions have created abject despair in the black ghettos as far as this reasoning goes it manifests a partial truth and isolates obvious symptoms what is most lamentable is that no one commenting on the plight of the northern negro has bothered to carry his diagnosis to its logical conclusion the rioters vented a despair with our democratic process as they have come to know it for them it is a way of life that has frustrated and aborted their dreams of a better life it would be facetious to think of their despair as being general and aimless the los angeles rioters words and targets for destruction were all too pointed if not confused and ill directed further a people suffering from diffused hopelessness seldom riot riots are born of hope how meaningless to the rioters are all the federal laws attempting to enfranchise the southern negro in the north and west the     negro has enjoyed the right to vote to patronize most restaurants air terminals and hotels recently these have not been the goals of the northern negro he has voted and moreover he has elected negro politicians to office in the past and even the present the white northern politicians have used whatever means suitable to placate their ethnically diverse electorate they have been all things to all people when among the italians they have been lovers of spaghetti and the glory of rome at the same time they have attempted to calm these white citizens about the negroes encroaching on their neighborhoods when among the slavic people the irish and the polish the same approach has been used these politicians have failed to give leadership to either the white or negro electorate when addressing their white voters they have appealed to their fears and prejudices and at the same time have venerated if not sanctified the status quo regarding housing and the schools when among negroes these same politicians have mouthed platitudes vacuous promises and humiliating pleas for patience for practical purposes and political expediency few have appealed to their citizens sense of justice democratic idealism and a dream of a better life for all this lack of political imagination and faith in our democratic system has invaded and permeated all phases of citygovernment the slums and corruption in most northern cities are the end products of governing cynics who would rather serve consecutive years in office with a hope for a higher position in government than lead courageously confronted with explosive antagonisms hatreds and fears in their cities many of these men are still searching for the expedient way as though what confronts them will go away freeing them to return to their jobs of misgoverning in addition the white northern politicians have given patronage and favors to a few negroes usually precinct and ward bosses it is the same pattern used all over the world whether on the plantations in the colonies among the peasants of europe or wherever in order to keep the masses in line a few men are selected for this purpose and given the trappings of prestige  and power plus a few favors and it works until the people are awakened during the last twentyfive years most urban centers have been governed by men of mediocre talents men who have lacked vision men who have placed personal ambition above the duties of office and men who have been too susceptible to influences of all kinds most large cities have monuments dedicated to these mens disservice if not criminal conduct the sprawling slums vice ridden streets overcrowded schools and other decaying conditions are their legacy to the future these pitiable politicians had plenty of assistance the realestate blocks fought to keep taxes down they fought to preserve the black ghetto by opposing fair housing the industrialist and business man wanted peace and low taxes the pressure groups among the white power structure wanted social and economic conditions to improve without changing the comfortable and profitable structure although the negro in watts harlem hough and other ghettos sees his enemy as white his enemy wears all the colors of men he is fighting corruption and penuriously ambitious men who desire wealth and position and assume few social or democratic responsibilities in the black ghetto there is a constant cry of police brutality in one northern city there are at least seven negro councilmen serving the city these negro councilmen have made few if any attempts to investigate these allegations of police brutality to meet with the citizenry and police representatives to promote understanding and reciprocal responsibility while doing nothing officially to eliminate police brutality or to exonerate the police force the negro politicians decry police brutality in their wards the police departments are placed in the precarious and untenable position of attempting to preserve law and order where respect for law and order no longer exists in watts the police were referred to as the occupying force to the negro in the slums the police are protecting the mans system which is by definition the enemy what the negro has not learned is that the man is not always white the police also have their burden to bear they cannot demand respect from a citizenry that pays them off to operate numbers rackets speakeasies and to pander the dialectics of this kind of situation are unavoidable contemptuous disdain for police and law results only a fool would expect other consequences and further it should be apparent to all that the police enforce the law only with the consent of the vast majority of a population without this consent occupation best describes their function it would be foolhardy and an invitation to all kinds of extremists to encourage more stringent law enforcement without attempting to solve the basic source of hatred for law and order and as long as the people of the black ghetto believe that the police represent a white monolithic power whose only aim is to contain suppress exploit and brutalize them the basic attitudes and problems have not been touched again we see one more symptom of despair with a democratic system which has shown its weaknesses and contempt for a people forcing them to embrace a value system and attitudes which are antithetical to the highest ideals of democracy if the negro of the ghetto were to embrace the expressed values of white society it would be tantamount to selfnegation and insanity one would think that the negroes in the black ghetto would be able to discuss their grievances with school administrators and reach settlements acceptable to both groups for years the schools have cried for parental interest and involvement with the educational process their pronounced goal has been the whole child when a levy was needed community schools has been the pass word street clubs community councils and civil_rights groups have found boards of education and school administrators unreceptive and resentful of their concerns and complaints perhaps what is most frightening about all of these people responsible for public education is the impression they convey that they and only they are qualified to have opinions about the education of children parents who resent halfday sessions for their children who complain of overcrowded classrooms who challenge a curriculum that frustrates and retards their children and who want a modern technical training program for their high schools are treated as subversives these parents are called trouble makers usually aroused by a hard core of trouble makers yet the problems persist educators and boards of education spend more time and energy attacking their critics and address too little effort to eliminating the problems which cause the criticism there are many whites in the urban centers who judge a school excellent if it is all white as one teacher in a large northern city stated all children regardless of social status race or religion receive the same education in this townan inferior one theres no prejudice here it is not accidental that a small number of merit scholarships if any are awarded to children from the urban center last year in one large city the only student awarded a merit scholarship was a negro girl whites also have every reason to be alarmed about their educational system unfortunately the white middle class has fled to the suburbs leaving the lower class whites who as yet have not thoroughly examined their educational system whites within the central city have become staunch defenders of the neighborhood school concept it has become more than a concept it is discussed as though it were an  inviolate right frankly i fail to see the advantage of a white child sitting next to a negro child and both receiving the same miseducation in the same overcrowded classroom and if sitting next to a white child will prevent sociopsychological mutilation then there are thousands of negroes in cleveland chicago los angeles and other large cities who have escaped this malady during the thirties and forties many of these negroes sat next to white children it is questionable whether this limited school contact changed either the negro or white child that much certainly during high school white and negro contacts were confined to school affairs and nonschool social contacts were limited if at all many civil_rights leaders psychologists and sociologists are of the opinion that if a school is integrated that the negro child will receive a better education because the schools have higher standards for whites this is a partial truth if the white children are from poor families and if their parents are not vocal and do not insist on equality education they will receive the same education as the negro child most of the white parents who are concerned about their childrens education have moved to the suburbs or enrolled their children in private schools the majority of whites remaining in the central city are in the same boat as the negro the only difference is they just are not aware of their plight yet or the dire consequences of miseducation their children must bear in the future the public school problem in the black ghetto reveals another area where those who persist in attempting to use all legal and democratic procedures to effect change have been forced into the streets and demonstrations those negroes attempting to use normal channels such as through meetings discussions with school authorities and community leaders to effect changes in their schools have usually met frustration patronizing indulgence and the contumely of the school administrators and boards of education where words have failed sitins and demonstrations have succeeded in some instances consequently those who have opposed and closed the door on discussion have taught the negro that demonstrations picketing and sitins are their most effective bargaining tools admittedly this is a pathetic commentary on the nation that is attempting to instruct the world in democratic procedure in the north the black ghetto has been without leadership in the past the naacp has attracted the support of the negro middle class recently core chapters have been established in the ghetto but have not as yet captured the imagination and following of the people for the most part negro ministers have concerned themselves with the hereafter today these ministers are treated with derision and contempt too many of these men of the cloth have pointed their congregations heart toward the heavens while they have cruised the ghetto in cadillacs expensive clothing and lived in garish homes to fill this leadership vacuum many groups have arisen in the ghetto boards of education city administrators and politicians have called these groups extremist this produces a perplexing paradox during the initial stage of civil discontent with the schools police housing inspectors community councils and other less militant groups were brushed aside rendering them ineffectual in the eyes of the ghetto now that more militant organizations have arisen and are unwilling to be pushed aside these groups are called radical and irresponsible there is one lesson that all negro and whites had better learn today no one will lead in the ghetto unless he voices in unequivocable words the discontents of the ghetto the respected negro professional business man or politician does not lead in the ghetto their absence during the riots in los angeles was by design and not by accident the negro middle class fled the black ghetto for the same reasons the white middle class abandoned the central city these black professionals clerks and small business men have contributed little leadership financial investment or spiritual encouragement to their less fortunate brothers they have concerned themselves with homes in the suburbs cars swimming pools cotillions and all the frills and leisurely decadence of their class tragically this middle class is an imitation of the white middle class it has all the pretensions and decadence but for the most part have no capital working for them most of these middle class negroes are running scared to maintain their recently acquired standard of living and all important appearance the negro middle class does not have a history of frugality civic responsibility and financial investment in our economy the black suburbanite was born in imitation and decadence its creative period belongs to the future for the most part they would rather have the negroes in the ghetto become more moderate after all things are much better today for the negro obviously there is no easy answer to the problems of the black ghetto the answers that will emerge and are tried will deeply change our entire american way of life of this most people are assured the primary need in the ghetto is to rekindle faith in our democratic procedure i do not minimize the need for jobs training education and food but if the lower class negro is to enter our society as a productive and creative person he must have faith in the dem ocratic system he also must make a contribution toward his habilitation not only a contribution but assume leadership and give direction to his own destiny there are those who for a number of reasons do not want the poor represented in the policy making level in these habilitative programs if the people of watts harlem and hough cannot produce their own responsible leadership and assist in their own economical and educational habilitation we had better withdraw from viet nam and all the other backward nations of the world surely if we cannot effect self determination in our own country we must fail abroad where disparate cultures languages and histories compound our problems regardless of how many demonstrations riots and sitins follow eventually someone must sit down and discuss the issues if local groups neighborhood clubs and community councils were to take an active part in planning and executing these programs it would give them the dignity and the responsibility for their own futures that charity and patronage have eroded naturally there are going to be problems there are class and racial antagonisms to be dealt with professionals are going to think that they are in a better position to understand diagnose and plan perhaps so if so they should be able to persuade by revealing information and reasoning these professionals have a responsibility to educate these negro leaders these professionals also have a responsibility to learn often what separates them from the untutored negro leaders is vocabulary hardly meriting the weight usually given it dialogues must be established with boards of education police departments and other agencies problems must be discussed openly and honestly above all positive results must emerge on both sides if not there are always those waiting to denounce these procedures and take to the ctreets the people will take to the streets rightly so if we fail to provide them with an effective means of settling their grievances opening discussions and meetings on the street level appear to be the only solution today there is no organization which can command a sizeable following and control over the ghetto for that the authorities should be thankful but unless action is taken to enlist the participation of the black ghetto to improve conditions and establish confidence in democratic procedures we had better be prepared to face the consequences of this inaction if that sad day should come we will have forsaken the dream that we now offer the world and without this hope and this dream does america have anything to offer that is not now in abundance  
up from paternalism 
by the rev c eugene askew
»he p ost civil war era that could with some justification be identi fied by the title of booker t washingtons autobiography up from slavery has at long last given way to a time of increasing civil_rights for minority groups there are abundant indications that in the near future assured civil_rights for every american citizen will be a reality now there lies ahead an era which can perhaps be characterized as up from paternalism an age much more subtle since it is in the realm of intangible attitudes civil_rights can be gained through political power respect other than for power alone cannot on the whole nonviolent negro demonstrations boycotts sitins and the like have gained not only civil_rights but also a growing respect for negroes from the white community moreover with rapidly expanding cultural educational and employment opportunities for negroes the gap inevitably will be narrowed between the negro and white worlds with both an increased sense of dignity within negroes and a belated recognition of the negros capabilities by the hitherto considerably more privileged white citizens it also is inevitable that attitudes will change as negro and white people work play and study together on a free and equal basis while i am willing to sacrifice my convenience for genuine integration i must confess that i am enjoying this interim period while the white people in houston get used to integration of our public facilities my wife and i sit in the unreserved section to watch the houston astros home baseball games we have found both to our regret for the still prevailing racial prejudice and to our secret delight at our personal good fortune that even at wellattended games we can arrive at game time and still find excellent seats on the first or second row next to negroes we shall either have to go earlier or miss our choice seats when this particular kind of prejudice disappears the same situation is found at motion picture theatres but to a lesser degree perhaps when some white people get used to the dark and realize that they are sitting next to negroes they do not want to make a fetish of moving if so this in itself is an improvement over past attitudes or it may be that white people feel that in a darkened theatre other white people will not know they are sitting next to negroes having been reared in georgia i know that most southern people do not feel any strangeness or repugnance in associating intimately with negro people so long as either no other white person is watching or the association is on an obviously paternalistic level or perhaps racial prejudice is simply less strong among the moviegoing public than among baseball fans racial attitudes are certainly changing rapidly in america so much so that within a few generations no one will speak of the future of the american negro for the simple reason that there will be no such thing as an american negro miscegenation legal and illegal and past present and future will take care of color lines although not of class and economic prejudices it is only a matter of time until underprivileged segregationists and lower class negroes join forces for their mutual interests  in the meanwhile however all american people have to live together in a present which is shaping the future sometimes i get impatient with endless and aimless liberal talk that is often irresponsible and appears to do as much harm as good this talk nevertheless does indicate a degree of interest and concern out of such talk there will eventually evolve attitudes and actions which will permanently alter our american society it has been my observation through years as a minister in particular and an observer of the american scene in general that church people are very much like the rest of the populace in the churches i have served as in the political arena it is always the liberals who dream the dreams and force the conservatives out of their complacency but when the dreams have to be translated into reality the liberals seldom have the stability and knowhow to get the job done    i have learned from experience that almost always it is the dissatisfied or even neurotic element which stirs things up and then depends on the conservative and usually more stable group to sift the good ideas from the bad and make them work without the liberals the status quo almost always gets more and more smug and lifeless but without the conservatives worthwhile dreams often turn into nightmares of inefficiency and rebellion serving merely as a vent for frustration since church people on the whole are politically and socially at least as conservative as the  general population the present church support of the civil_rights movement indicates that the battle for civil_rights for negroes has been won only the translation of this new mood into effective political and social action remains to be fully implemented now a new and much more complicated battle has to be fought to eliminate or to reduce paternalism there are few white americans who are not guilty of paternalistic attitudes toward negroes even if these attitudes are not selfrecognizable or apparent to casual observers i have long prided myself on having liberal racial attitudes articles i have written speeches i have made sermons i have preached and actions i have taken in behalf of negro people have at times brought distress to my family but it is only during the past few months that i have begun to see within myself racial prejudices which i thought had disappeared  years ago perhaps a better title for this present article might well be confessions of a white paternalist i remember vividly back in the middle s when as a teenager i was the only pupil in a large church school class to vote in favor of a proposed interracial meeting to be held at our church but standing up for the dignity and rights of others does not necessarily guarantee that one does not carry within himself subtle paternalistic attitudes which are all tooapparent to sensitive negro people subtle racial paternalism is a necessary phase in social change which america must now endure as it earlier endured slavery near slavery and open paternalism but the phase can be considerably shortened and less damaging if white americans will take a good look at themselves in the attempt to ferret out both their conscious and subconscious paternalistic attitudes i see no logical reason why white americans consciously seeking better racial attitudes should feel guilty because our fathers have eaten sour grapes and have set our teeth on edge we are not responsible for the sins of our fathers although we may be responsible for the prejudices of our children one simply cannot be brought up in a society where a minority group has consistently been exploited ridiculed and degraded without coming to feel emotionally if not rationally that such people have to be treated differently from other peoplethe worst of us employing harshness and force and the best of us thinking of negroes as somewhat like children even if our actions to them are kind and just much of white criticism for some present negro actions and i include myself among these white critics may well include the attitude of a father to a rebellious teenager whom the father knows has to rebel in order to grow nevertheless the father also resents his loss of control over the son in time a rebellious son grows up and has a mature meaningful relationship to the father if the latter has been loving wise and emotionally mature enough himself to let his son be his own man even while giving the support every boy needs from his father the above analogy is very common indeed among white people the racial attitude of the late dr albert schweitzer furnishing a conspicuous examplebut the analogy is not justified because negro adults are not children and they rightly resent being treated as such even if one excludes such ridiculous fantasies as an ignorant white backwoodsman thinking that he is a better man than a ralph bunche although the chances are that the former has never even heard of the latter there is still within most white people an emotional feeling that negroes are not really equal to white peoplea feeling inevitably imposed by past american political social cultural educational and economic conditions negro people to some degree have accepted subconsciously if not consciously the white mans judgment concerning their alleged inferiority even among negroes a lighter skin has been generally judged to be superior white values have been prized and sought paternalism reveals itself in many ways for example only in recent years have i learned not to speak with individual negroes concerning race if they themselves initiate such discussion i of course participate openly but otherwise i do not even at the risk of some negro and white people assuming especially since i am a native southerner that i am racially prejudiced in the long run such simple acceptance of people as they are without mention of race will do more to eliminate paternalism than unlimited and embarrassing protestations of racial brotherhood by white people to negroes i have often sung for civic and church groups the most popular selection and the one i did best was a version of shortnin bread complete with a negro dialect borrowed from versions by lawrence tibbitt and lansing hatfield with additions of my own another favorite was water boy a song made vivid to me by my boyhood recollections of watching negro convicts work and sing but both songs present certain negro stereotypes in an affectionate but nevertheless paternalistic way to be sure i never sang either of these songs without following with op man river some years ago however my conscience began to bother me about singing these songs as i became more sensitive to negro feelings with great reluctance i decided never to sing these songs again until such time as these stereotypes no longer exist or negro and white people can accept these songs as folk music and folklore without traumaan evolvement not likely to take place in this generation paternalism exists in many forms both recognized and unrecognized within almost all american white people all of these forms must diligently be searched for and eliminated from the lives of all white men if the era of subtle paternalism is to be transcended as the last great barrier separating human beings and degrading all whom it touches 
west indian partisans in the fight for
by john henrik clarke
est indians have been coming to the united states for over a century the part they have played in the progress of the afroamericans in  their long march from slavery to freedom has always been an important factor more important is the fact that the most outstanding of these caribbeanamericans saw their plight and the plight of the afroamerican as being one and the same as early as  a jamaican john b russwurm one of the founders of liberia was the first colored man to be graduated from an american college and to publish a newspaper in this country sixteen years later his fellow countryman peter ogden organized in new york city the first oddfellows lodge for negroes prior to the civil war west indian contribution to the progress of the afroamerican life was one of the main contributing factors in the fight for freedom and full citizenship in the northern part of the united states in his book souls of black folk dr w e b du bois says that the west indians were mainly responsible for the manhood program presented by the race in the early decades of the last century indicative of their tendency to blaze new paths is the achievement of john w a shaw of antigua who in the early s of the last century passed the civil service tests and became deputy commissioner of taxes for the county of queens in new york state in th century america two of the most outstanding fighters for liberty and justice were the west indiansprince hall and john b russwurm when prince hall came to the united states the nation was in turmoil the colonies were ablaze with indignation britain with a series of revenue acts had stoked the fires of colonial discontent in virginia patrick henry was speaking of liberty or death the cry no taxation without representation played on the nerve strings of the nation prince hall then a delicatelooking teenager often walked through the turbulent streets of boston an observer unobserved a few months before these hectic scenes he had arrived in the united states from his home in barbados where he had been born about  the son of an englishman and a free african woman he was in theory a free man but he knew that neither in boston nor in barbados were persons of african descent free in fact at once he questioned the sincerity of the vocal white patriots of boston it never seemed to have occurred to them that the announced principles motivating their action was stronger argument in favor of destroying the system of slavery the colonists held in servitude more than a half million human beings some of them white yet they engaged in the contradiction of going to war to support the theory that all men were created equal when prince hall arrived in boston that city was the center of the american slave trade most of the major leaders of revolutionary movement in fact were slaveholders or investors in slavesupported businesses hall like many other americans wondered what did these men mean by freedom the condition of the free black men as prince hall found them was not an enviable one emancipation brought neither freedom nor relief from the stigma of color they were free in name only they were still included with slaves indentured servants and indians in the slave codes discriminatory laws severely circumscribed their freedom of movement by  prince hall saw little change in the condition of the blacks and though a freeman at least in theory he saw his people debased as though they were slaves still in bondage these things drove him to prepare himself for leader ship among his people so through diligence and frugality he became a property owner thus establishing himself in the eyes of white people as well as the blacks but the ownership of property was not enough he still had to endure sneers and insults he decided then to prepare himself for a role of leadership among his people to this end he went to school at night and later became a methodist preacher his church became the forum for his peoples grievances ten years after his arrival in boston massachusetts he was the accepted leader of the black community in  hall petitioned the massachusetts legislature protesting the kidnapping of free negroes this was a time when american patriots were engaged in a constitutional struggle for freedom they had proclaimed the inherent rights of all mankind to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hall dared to remind them that the black men in the united states were human beings and as such were entitled to freedom and respect for their human personality prejudice made hall the father of african secret societies in the united states he is the father of what is now known as negro mas  onry hall first sought initiation into the white masonic lodge in boston but was turned down because of his color he then applied to the army lodge of an irish regiment his petition was favorably received on march   hall and fourteen other black americans were initiated in lodge number  when on march  the british were forced to evacuate boston the army lodge gave prince hall and his colleagues a license to meet and function as a lodge thus on july   african lodge no  came into being this was the first lodge in masonry established in america for men of african descent the founding of the african lodge was one of prince halls greatest achievements it afforded the africans in the new england area of the united states a greater sense of security and contributed to a new spirit of unity among them halls interest did not end with the lodge he was deeply concerned with improving the lot of his people in other ways he sought to have schools established for the children of the free africans in massachusetts of prime importance is the fact that prince hall worked to secure respect for the personality of his people and also played a significant role in the downfall of the massachusetts slave trade he helped to prepare the groundwork for the freedom fighters of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose continuing efforts have brought the black american closer to the goal of full citizenship in his series of articles entitled pioneers in protest lerone bennett senior editor of ebony magazine has written a capsule biography of john b russworm the distinguished west indian who was a pioneer in afroamerican journalism the following information has been extracted from his article founders of the negro press ebony magazine july  day in and day out the negroes of new york city were mercilessly lampooned in the white press in the dying days of  the campaign of vilification and slander reached nauseous heights the integrity and courage of negro men were openly questioned worse editors invaded negro homes and impugned the chastity of negro women    this was a time of acute crisis for all negro americans and the new york leaders were agonizingly conscious of the forces arrayed against them    more ominous was the creeping power of the american colonization society which wanted to send free negroes back to africa john b russwurm and samuel e cornish two of the youngest and most promising of the new york leaders were assigned the task of inventing a journal that could speak forcibly to both the enemy and joint friend without and the brethren within the veil samuel e cornish who is virtually unknown today was born about  in delaware and raised in relatively free environments of philadelphia and new york he organized the first negro presbyterian church in new york city russworm who is generally credited with being the first negrograduate of an american college was a jamaican the son of an englishman and an african woman his father neglected to inform his white wife of the sins of his youth but after his death the widow learned of his existence and financed his education at bowdoin college where he was graduated in  russwurm and cornish made an excellent team despite the difference in their backgrounds in the prospectus for the proposed paper they idealistically stated we shall ever regard the constitution of the united states as our polar star pledged to no party we shall endeavor to urge our brethren to use their rights to the elective franchise as free citizens it shall never be our objective to court controversy though we must at all times consider ourselves as champions in defense of oppressed humanity daily slandered we think that there ought to be some channel of communication between us and the public through which a single voice may be heard in defense of five hundred thousand free people of color    on friday march   the first issue of freedoms journal the first negro newspaper in the western world appeared on the streets of new york city in their ambitious first editorial russwurm and cornish struck a high note of positiveness that still has something to say to the afroamericans in their present plight it read in part we wish to plead our own  cause too long have others spoke for us too long has the republic been deceived by misrepresentations in things which concern us dearly though in the estimation of some mere trifles for though there are many in society who exercise toward us benevolent feelings still with sorrow we confess it there are others who make it their business to enlarge upon the least trifle which tends to discredit any person of color and pronounce anathema and denounce our whole body for the misconduct of this guilty one    our vices and our degradation are ever arrayed against us but our virtues are passed unnoticed    it is our earnest wish the first editorial of the first negro newspaper said to make our journal a medium of intercourse between our brethren in different states of this great confederacy the timeliness of this editorial written over a hundred years ago and the dynamics of its intellectual content is far ahead of most editorials that appear in presentday afroamerican newspapers during the later years of his life john b russwurm moved to a position that today would be called black nationalism after receiving his masters degree from bowdoin college in  russwurm went to liberia in west africa where he established another newspaper the liberia herald and served as superintendent of schools after further distinguishing himself as the governor of the maryland colony of cape palmas this pioneer editor and freedom fighter died in liberia in  the same year john b russwurm died another west indian edward w blyden went to africa and established himself in liberia he was destined to become the greatest black intellectual of the th century he concerned himself with the plight of african people the world over and eventually built a bridge of understanding between the people of african origin in the west indies the united states and in africa more than anyone else in the th and during the early part of the th century edward w blyden called upon the black man to reclaim himself and his ancient african glory the concept now being called negritude started with blyden blyden was born in the then danish west indian island of st thomas in  but reacted against treatment of his people in the new world by emigrating to liberia in  he was convinced that the only way to bring respect and dignity to the people of african descent was by building progressive new empires in africa whose civilization while remaining basically african would incorporate useful elements of western culture it was the great edward w blyden who with the immortal frederick douglass placed before the bar of public opinion in england and other countries in europe the case of the black man in america as far back as  the renowned scholar and benefactor of west africa dr edward wilmot blyden speaking on the occasion of his inauguration as president of liberia college sounded the note for the organized teaching of the culture and civilization of africa and decried the fact that the worlds image of africa was not in keeping with africas true status in world history i quote from his address on this occasion the people generally are not yet prepared to understand their own interests in the great work to be done for themselves and their children we shall be obliged to work for some time to come not only without the popular sympathy we ought to have but with utterly inadequate resources in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary books geographies travels histories    having embraced or at least assented to these falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes and whatever his literary attainments or acquired ability he fancies that he must grind at the mill which is provided for him putting in material furnished to his hands bringing no contribution from his own field and of course nothing comes out but what is put in blyden made several trips to the united states and to his former home in the west indies with the gold coast nationalist j e casely hayford blyden developed the idea of a federation of west african states he died in  of all the west indians who influenced the afroamerican freedom struggle the most colorful and the most controversial was marcus aurelius garvey among the numerous black manassehs who presented themselves and their grandiose programs to the people of harlem marcus garvey was singularly unique he was born in jamaica in  the grandson of an african slavea fact that was his proudest boast he had grown up under a threeway color system white mulatto and black garveys reaction to color prejudice and his search for a way to rise above it and lead his people back to africa spiritually if not physically was the allconsuming passion of his existence marcus garveys glorious romantic and riotous movement exhorted the black race and fixed their eyes on the bright star of a future in which they would reclaim and rebuild their african homeland and heritage garvey came to the united states as a disciple of booker t washington founder of tuskegee institute unfortunately booker t washington died before marcus garvey reached this coun try garvey had planned to raise funds and return to jamaica to establish an institution similar to tuskegee in  he had organized the universal negro improvement association in jamaica after the failure of this organization he looked to the united states where he found a loyal group of followers willing to listen to his message garvey succeeded in building a mass movement among american negroes while other leaders were attempting it and doubting that it could be done he advocated the return of africa to the africans and people of african descent he organized very rashly and incompetently the black star line a steamship company for transporting people of african descent from the united states to africa garvey and his movement had a short and spectacular life span in the united states his movement took really effective form in about  and by  he was in a federal prison charged with misusing the mails from prison he was deported home to jamaica this is briefly the essence of the garvey saga the selfproclaimed provisional president of africa never set foot on african soil he spoke no african language but garvey managed to convey to members of the black race everywhere and to the rest of the world his passionate belief that africa was the home of a civilization which had once been great and would be great again when one takes into consideration the slenderness of garveys resources and the vast material forces social conceptions and imperial interests which automatically sought to destroy him his achievement remains one of the great propaganda miracles of this country the deportation of marcus garvey and the decline of his movement marked the end of an era an era when west indians and afroamericans worked together and saw their plight as one and the same in spite of the contributions that west indians continued to make to the afroamerican freedom struggle the relations between these two basically african people deteriorated there are indications that the present freedom struggle in africa the caribbean area and in the united states will become the basis for a new era of understanding and cooperation 
foreign investments a boon to africa
by a okonkwo nwani
any writers on economic development have asserted that one of the causes for the low level of industrial output or absence of industrialism in african countries is the lack of capital and little or no investment domestically or internally to industrialize therefore foreign investments become very necessary and act as the agent or conveyor of progress this article is intended to dispel this timehonored notion and affirm that african countries should not depend upon foreign investment for industrialization since the investments from abroad have negative and destabilizing effects on the social stability of african countries foreign investments have their political economic and religious or ideological riders attached i will not be concerned with statistics in this paper to avoid unnecessary details but will only consider the question if african countries should industrialize without foreign investments from where will the funds for industrialization come to answer such a question a distinction should be made in the term economic surplus which is used for investment actual economic surplus is the difference between the societys actual current output and its actual current consumption it is identical with current saving or accumulation and finds its embodiment in assets of various kinds added to societys wealth during the period in question ie productive facilities and equipment inventories foreign balances and gold hoards actual economic surplus has been generated in all socioeconomic formations and while its size and structure have markedly differed from one phase of development to another its existence has characterized nearly all of mans history in africa this is equally true the magnitude of the actual economic surplus which is savings or capital formation is at least conceptually readily established and today is regularly estimated by statistical agencies in most countries the difficulties that are encountered in its measurement are merely technical which in the case of african countries is a case for organization lack of adequate statistical agencies is neither identical with nor synonymous with the lack of savings of a high magnitude another aspect that one has to consider is potential economic surplus ie the difference between the output that could be produced in a given natural technological environment with the help of employable productive resources and what might be regarded as essential consumption its realization presupposes a more or less drastic reorganization of the production and distribution of social output and implies farreaching changes in the structure of the society the potential economic surplus can be classified under four headings  the societys excess consumption on the part of the upper income groups  the output lost to society through the existence of unproductive workers  the output lost due to irrational and wasteful organization of the existing productive apparatus  the output foregone due to the existence of unemployment caused primarily by the anarchy of foreign production systems and ideology and the deficiency of effective demand correcting these shortcomings generated by the colonial system as they are in african countries the potential economic surplus would be undoubtedly realized as actual economic surplus which could be channelled into investment uses in most if not all african countries the shortage of capital does not exist as it seems to appear in most writings on industrially developing african countries the potential economic surplus that could be made available for such investment is large in all of them it is not large in absolute magnitudes as we deal with in highly industrialized countries such as the united states and great britain leaving the idea of the presence of sufficient internal capital for industrialization i will examine the types of foreign investments made in african countries a survey of the major private investments in africa shows that they were concentrated in the agricultural and extractive industries little or no investment was made in manufacture in all areas of africa where foreign investment has been made one fact stands out clearly the suppression of the inalienable rights of africans foreign investments foreign investments in africa have been praised as having been made with the primary reason of supplying the necessary capital for africas industrialization about  per cent of such investments were concentrated in mining the principal areas are as follows mining south africa diamonds manganese gold and uranium libya petroleum zambia copper algeria petroleum congo republic copper cobalt diamonds and uranium angola copper cadmium zinc and diamonds ghana bauxite gold manganese nigeria tin petroleum gold sierra leone diamonds manganese southern rhodesia copper egypt uar phosphate iron ore liberia bauxite diamonds ethiopia petroleum s w africa copper diamonds uranium agriculture south africa wool liberia rubber ghana cocoa nigeria palm products rubber ethiopia coffee tanzannia sisal kenya coffee uganda coffee algeria citrus sudan cotton cameroon bananas mozambique tobacco southern rhodesia tobacco what are the social consequences of these foreign investments in these areas how do these investments as development schemes look to african eyes who benefits from them who pays for them what are the already apparent and probable future consequences of these schemes the answers to these questions will to some degree bring out the social impact of foreign investments in africa let us start with the mining interests in the preforeign investment period the peoples of africa owned their mines beneath the surface of their lands centuries before the advent of europeans in africa they mined such minerals as iron copper and tin they utilized these minerals in the local manufacture of their weapons for battle their agricultural implements their household wares and used bronze in works of art an outstanding example is the bronze work of benin which attracted the portuguese merchants to west africa the rich copper deposits of central africa now the property of belgian british and american corporations were originally owned and worked by africans in the present messina district of the northern transvaal south africa the bavenda carried on extensive shaftmining and smelting of copper ore in southwest africa copper ore was mined by the herero and was carried northward from tsumeb to ondangua to be smelted and worked by the ovambo coppersmiths today the tsumeb mines are owned by new york corporations and the herero and ovambo are brought to the mines to work as unskilled labourers the investments in mining by europeans and americans was the first step of conquest then followed the building of roads railroads capital importation and the promotion of european migration to the main areas of investment the final step in this process in the aftermath of world war ii has been aimed at carrying on the economic conquest in the form of foreign aid to complete systemize and accelerate the extraction of the continents resources the various governments added to the investments while the united states assumed the role of general overseer the investments made by foreign corporations and even governments were made for a definite goalprofits from and subjugation of the africans in africa ments in the whole of africa foreign investment was the principal cause for the concentration of european settlements in african countries there was the lure of diamonds and gold in south africa leading from there into rhodesia and southwest africa there were the attractions of the beautiful high plateau country in kenya and southern angola there were governmentsponsored settlement schemes for strategic or economic objectives to tackle the main questions asked earlier a few specific areas will be discussed now in almost all african countries the land was regarded as common property of the group the family clan tribe or nation land tenure is based on three cardinal principles that the land ultimately belongs to the community and cannot be alienated from it without its consent that within the community the individual shall have security of tenure for the land he requires for grazing his cattle his gardens his farms and that no member of the community shall be without land the land still remains the basis of life for the great majority of the people of africa including the most industrialized sections of the continent the old security of land tenure met its doom with the influx of foreign investment and european settlement in algeria south africa kenya rhodesia and mozambique it was the same story over and over again the original inhabitants were pushed back by the forces of foreign investment and by the newcomers who took the choicest areas for themselves and marked off what they did not require of what land was left for the exclusive habitation of the africans large areas were sequestered against future contingencies or out of sheer greedy speculation in kenya for example in   europeans were in possession of  acres of land of which only  acres were under cultivation while some  or more kikuyus were crowded into a reserve measuring  acres the belgians in the congo and the french in equatorial and west africa usurped and allocated land for settlement or concession without regard to the legal rights of the original owners in south africa the story was much more gloomy in the interest of development with foreign investments people were driven off the land into restricted areas with the primary objective of forcing them to work outside the land available to them land alienation transformed selfsupporting farmers into squatter tenant farmers or migrant labourers on the settlers farms or drove them to the mines and cities in search of work furthermore where the land was taken or where it was not a tax was levied on every male african who appeared to have reached his sixteenth or eighteenth birthday settlers became liable for taxation when twentyone such taxation reinforced by automatic fines or imprisonment per cent of the tax or two  months in jail in malawi nyasaland as an exampleserved effectively in increasing the labour supply to conclude the social evil of foreign investment in agriculture a comparison between the africancontrolled and settlercontrolled agriculturalsystem follows the wealth of west african colonies is largely due to the fact that they are cultivated by the people of the soil working in their own interests    it is not an accident that colonies where the land remains in african hands pay their way where the land is given to settlers agriculture has to be subsidized in one way or another even in south africa the white farmer will not do a mans job and farming there survives by the crushing exploitation of the african and by differential taxation and special concessions on the railway which have to be paid by other users a careful examination of this will clearly show the problems of surplus raised earlier investment in mining in the bible we read god so loved the world that he gave his only son to redeem man on earth can we say that foreign investors so loved africans and the african quest for industrialization as to pour large sums of investible funds into the african continent directly i will say that was not the case profits by exploitation was the motivating force which pushed the bloated silkhatted couponclipping financiers to invest in africa a few remarks about mining in some african countries will be appropriate at this point european mining in south africa began about  the total amount of recorded sales of diamonds and gold in the union of south africa through  is  billion this amount of monetary value was derived from  tons of gold and over  tons of diamonds the various minerals are itemized as follows value realized from minerals recorded sales through ®  million gold  diamonds  coal  asbestos  copper  uranium  manganese  chrome  iron ore  the amount calculated in the table was the value at the time they were sold if we were to use current prices it would come to over  billion  in zambia northern rhodesia the value of copper sold was  billion in southern rhodesia the gold asbestos coal chrome and tungsten marketed brought a revenue of  million between  and  and in   million in the belgian congo now congo leopoldville the european mining of gold began in  copper in  diamonds and tin in  later cobalt and manganese started to play a vital role in mineral exports if we neglect the value of undisclosed and substantial amounts of uranium and other fissionable materials exported the value comes to  million annually between  and  the northeastern corner of angola has been aptly called a diamond country there the diamond company of angola has been called portugals most notable private enterprise in terms of its revenues perhaps yes but the social policies directed against the africans are atrociously criminal more than  carats of diamonds were exported in  alone this very company claims the distinction of having the lowest paid mine workers to be found anywhere in africa in  over  of its  african employees were forced workers supplied by intervention of the authorities backed by the international bandits and conspirators these mine workers in angola were paid  a month  the net profits of the company for  alone was  and combined profits for  and  were  per cent over the total of invested capital in  the director of geological survey in ghana then gold coast reported that the value of the minerals extracted by the british from the colony since  was  million early in the th century the british dutch and danes were sending home gold to the value of  annually today the ashanti goldfield corporation makes a profit of  million from gold alone annually diamonds manganese and even agricultural produce are not accounted for in nigeria  tons of tin ore worth  million was exported between  and  in sierra leone between  and  more than  million tons of diamonds from the marampa plain were exported in  alone  tons were exported an account of all these mining ventures has one factor in common mining rights were illegally acquired through deceit and conspiracy thus highly diabolical and iniquitous the investments from abroad were mainly in equipment royalties paid if any were very little the apparent lack of capital for current industrialization is due in a large measure to the drain of the mineral wealth of africa by foreign investment it is a serious charge to makethat the wealth of africa is drained away minerals are one of africas precious assets yet the mines are almost always operated by european capitalist companies which pay dividends to their overseas shareholders heavy remuneration to their directors as likely as not the lions share of their taxes to the british exchequer royalties to venerable but functionless companies and enormous wages to local european employees what remains for the african workers and for the african exchequers are the crumbs from the rich mans table so writes dr rita hinden in the challenge of african poverty anybody who could put himself in the position of the african will definitely come to the same answer as an african would without my spelling it out foreign investment in my own appraisal has been a handicap an impediment and a liability to the industrialization of africa investments in agriculture and mining have not led to manufacturing of any kind by the very corporations operating there in all areas whether occupied by settlers or not only the negative aspects of foreign investments dominated the scene justice freedom and individualism have been grossly subverted and destroyed how many lives have been lost in africa how many are still dying today anyone vitally interested should check the events in all of africathe whole of africa and the slave trade algeria and the french kenya the rhodesias and the british union of south africa cum united states of america visavis africans belgium and the congo in all these places we can talk eloquently about liberty and freedom and about human rights and fundamental freedoms and about dignity and worth of the human personality but most of our vocabulary derives from a period when our society was individualistic consequently it has little meaning to those who live under conditions where individualism means premature deaths the africans point of view is that foreign investment is primarily interested in profits uranium and other minerals should never come before people people and their freedoms should always in all places and at all times come first unfortunately the credo of foreign investment is minerals loot and plunder profits and complete annihilation of the africans at this stage of the twentieth century foreign investment channelled through the subsidiaries of the corporations in the metropolitan centers of the world have not only affected the governments of african countries but also have affected the internal politics by sheer force of economic circumstances which appears to be unavoidable the corporate operations directly affect the amount of foreign exchange brought into or taken from an african country in the small countries foreign investments have materially affected the position of the domestic currency the expansion of corporate activities also have affected the level of employment its wage policies have had a direct effect on the wage level the adverse effect of this has been the weakening of the government in power and the strengthening of the opposition in some countries the corporations have espoused the strengthening of inhumane practices perpetrated against the africans typical examples are the union of south africa and apartheid southern rhodesia and the dictatorship of the minority over the majority not only have foreign investments increased instability in the past currently or in this decade all the military coups have been planned and executed with the cooperation of local agents without belaboring this issue the practices of oil companies in places like nigeria algeria and libya have had their social destabilizing effects one may ask why no mention was made of the positive contributions of foreign investments i am well aware of such but the negative effects far outstrip the positive effects what the future will be i do not know emphatically it seems to me that reliance on foreign investment for africas industrialization is a pure case of delusion and postponement of what should be done corrective steps should be taken new policies should be devised so that the

ne of the first and most significant collections of afroamerican poetry the poetry of the negro edited by arna bontemps and langston hughes was published in  for more than a decade this book was practically the onlyalthough a very richsource for the study and enjoyment of that vast body of poets whose race prevented them from taking welldeserved seats among their paler colleagues in the united states the poetry of the negro contains  poems written between  and  by  american poets of african descent eight of these poems are by one robert e hayden letter from the south a photograph of isadora duncan runagate runagate o daedalus fly away home homage to the empress of the blues eine kleine nachtmusik frederick douglass and  a ballad of remembrance it took until the year  when enterprising young dutchman paul breman a londoner by choice saw the quality and the importance  of haydens writing to put a representative collection of his work before the public the publisher gave this book the name of a  yearold poem and included five of the pieces from the anthology the poetry of the negro daedalus empress of the blues nachtmusik frederick douglass and that astonishingly contemporary poem a ballad of remembrance publishers or editors cannot just pick the poems they themselves like for a book they are about to publish there may and should be a dialogue between editor and poet but the creator of the work has of course the last word it is therefore remarkable that robert hayden who is one of his own works severest and most pitiless critics wanted these five poems of at least fifteen years ago to go into his london published volume that title poem is perhaps the most striking example of the total of robert haydens characteristics creativeness of image and language never obscure never out to baffle the reader always wanting to reach out to communicate are among the strongest and most valuable of these in his a ballad of remembrance quadroon mermaids afro angels black saints balanced upon the switchblades of that air and sang every time i read the ballad when i read it just with my eyes hearing the echo of the words singing inside me or when i read it aloud to make it communicate with people in an attempt to open their minds and ears to the voice of a true poet whenever or wherever i make contact with that ballad of remembrance i envy mark van doren to whom hayden addresses himself and therefore this is not only a ballad of remembrance    but also mark van doren a poem of remembrance a gift a souvenir for you in that way every poets poem is a gift a souvenir to everyone who approaches it and robert hayden is one of the afroamerican poets whose precious gifts have far too long lain unheeded hayden is certainly not a protest poet in the usual sense of the word he would refuse that label as he refuses to be pigeonholed as a negro poet or as one whose negritude or raceidentification features as a basic quality of his poetry and still  he is all that not primarily not deliberately not in prepense but naturally all that in him is truly instinct brainmatter diastole systole reflex action as he himself speaks of freedom and liberty as personified in the great frederick douglass at dakar as a member of the grand jury for the literature prizes and before the festival in the preselection jury in paris and london my colleagues and i tried to recognize the qualities of true poetry originality creativeness disciplined inspiration craftsmanship in the handling of the raw material namely the language    ability to communicate the ability to sing via the printed word into the heart and mind of a reader on the great prizegiving night our jurychairman langston hughes proudly announced that robert e hayden of the united states was our poet laureate and that honorary mentions were given to derek walcott of the west indian island of st lucia for his book in a green night and to christopher okigbo of nigeria for his collection of poetry limits it had been a difficult choice still the jury thought that haydens work deserved the ultimate honor which could be awarded to a book of poetry published between january  and september  which has not received any other prizes or distinctions in  during a visit at fisk i read robert haydens poem runagate at a meeting in which the poet was present runagate a dramatic poem about my private hero harriet tubman had been a favorite of mine for years in  i was preparing my book i am the new negro a book in which i attempt to show through poems songs and documents the  american negros own active  yearslong freedom fight i asked hayden for permission to include runagate and got  a completely new version and a letter from which i quote enclosed is the new version of runagate and i hope that it wont be too much of a trial you may not agree with me but i think its much better in places than the earlier one i should tell you this too it was your reading of runagate that night at the center which sent me back to the poem i hadnt looked at it for years had put it aside as another of my many failures hearing it i realized that it was not so bad as id thought  i am asking the editors of negro digest to print both versions of runagate compare them see how painstakingly a conscientious poet works how he succeeds after  years in stripping all sentimentality and extra dramatic effect from a piece and in giving it the ring of truth of clearer honesty give an hour of your time to a comparison of those two versions of the same poem and undergo the blessings of a true poets craftsmanship and of his sincere wish to impress and communicate through naked truth handled with an artists skill now that the dice have fallen  feel justified in revealing the essence of the report concerning a ballad of remembrance issued by the preselection jury for the anglophone literary prizes in order to facilitate the work of the grand jury at dakar a ballad of remembrance consists of four sections four acts of a drama or four symphonic movements or the four seasons hayden is a remarkable craftsman a striking singer of words his extraordinary talent makes itself known in almost every line from the first quadroon mermaids afroangels black saints of the title poem to the thunderous final bars of his poem to frederick douglass when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful and terrible thing    hayden writes about the land of his birth redbuds like momentary trees of an illusionist while in tour  he tells of static villages whose names are all thats left of choctaw chickasaw    children worldless and remote    one moment we are on a road in kentucky or the coast of maine then we are facing bessie smith who shone that smile on us and put the lights to shame and sang in witch doctor africa melts into america africa shines through an elks parade too when jack johnson in his limousine made all the arid ghetto bloom with fantasies of ethiopia    the third part of the book presents haydens remembrance of mexico  descriptive passionate detached involved alienated all the dark the light the joy the pain the fourth part of the ballad probes deepest in a newfound idiom sounds and images deeply linked with visual impressions apotheosis and coda are the ballad of nat turner    for the wheel in a turning wheel which is time  in eternity had ceased  its whirling and owl and moccassin  panther and nameless beast  and i were held like creatures fixed  in flaming in fiery amber    the last drumbeat then is for frederick douglass the preselection jury ranks robert haydens poetry with the best anglophone contemporary writing they recommend a ballad of remembrance most emphatically to the attention of the grand jury and to poet and friend robert hayden i want to say this at dakar the words negro and negritude negroness took on new meaning and new dignity negro means no more nor less than black african or of african descent without any emotional overtones negritude took on the meaning of unconditional acceptance of ones own individual self without any sense of inferiority or superiority it also refers to the awareness of certain aspects of group experiences in that respect i in my blanchitude can fully accept my negritude robert hayden belongs to the bahai world faith bahai is belief in the unity of all religions of all prophets in light half nightmare and half vision he speaks of the face of bahaullah prophet of the bahai faith in whose eyes hayden sees the suffering of the men and women who died at dachau and buchenwald for their specific negritude bahais believe in the unity of all mankind the universality of all of gods creation in haydens poem the prophet he speaks of the auroral darkness which is god and he sees energies like angels dance glorias of recognition they too sense their groupawareness and so the first world festival of negro arts has honoured an afroamericans artistic parity his natural negroness which is part of his natural humanness his americanness along with his universalness  the human integrity of an artist and the artistic integrity of a fellowman 
writers converge at fisk university
by david llorens
springs fragrance filled the air friday evening april  as writers civil_rights workers educators and students converged on the campus of fisk university in nashville to discuss the image of negro in american literature gathered in historical jubilee hall the nations oldest building of higher education for negroes reminded that the late w e b dubois passed this route while developing his genius an audience of about  persons eagerly anticipated the opening remarks and the promise of a stimulating weekend for too long weve looked into the eyes of the white master for an image of ourselves and with those words john oliver killens authorinresidence at fisk and director of the conference issued the challenge that would provide excitement anger joy and intense probing until the closing address two days later by ossie davis novelistessayist saunders redding keynoting the conference noted that the negro writers situation has never been good and earned the audiences favor as he spoke of the american negro having been imprisoned in the culture and social assumption of the western worldusually held in derision or contempt scholarly somewhat military in bearing redding observed that honest writers seek ultimately to discover the human condition he cited the value of negritude calling it a relatively inexplicable mystique and drew a loud burst of applause with his suggestion that the literary mainstream resembles a sewer redding quoted expatriate novelist julian mayfields admonition that it would be better for the black writer to remain silent than accept the shoddy literary values of white america but for those who entertained the idea of a writers conference without provocation or controversy the keynote address proved the contrary preoccupation with repossessing a heritage has led to distortion of values and reality in some cases said redding in a preface to accusing some negro writers of making heroes out of heels in their fiction on the receiving end of his charge were john a williams night song chester himes if he hollers let him go rosa guy bird in my window and james baldwin another country there were those who subscribed to the distinguished professors accusations but it was noteworthy that the lone applause was delivered by bert gilden coauthor with his wife katya of the novel hurry sundown a conference participant who would later provide insight into his enthusiasm over the put down of baldwin to paraphrase redding baldwin created a characterrufus who failed to engage the sympathy intended by the author the ensuing question and answer session found various baldwinian sensibilities ruffled including that of a most unusual clergyman father james woodruff episcopal chaplain at fisk someone mistook him for white at the start but by sunday night everyone knew he was indeed black who was in no way inhibited by his collar woodruff and a conservatively bearded young man pressed the issue of heroes and heels but redding muscles tensed overpowered his adversaries with the plea oh lord i dont want to argue however the ingredients for battle had reached surface and tomorrow would be another day the novel and its social relevance to the negro revolution was the subject of saturdays opening panel discussion bert gilden john o killens and margaret halsey author of with malice toward some and the pseudoethic were the panelists once more the memory of dubois prevailed as killens recalled dubois prophecy that the problem of the twentieth century is the color line and that the future of the world would be what colored men make it folksy and peopleoriented whether talking or writing the author of black mans burden insisted that we black folk inhale tragedy with each breath we take according to killens civilized as applied to black people in white western culture is a euphemism for enslaved allowing that all propaganda is not art killens contended that all art is propaganda he asked when are you writers going to define some terms like integration liberalism nonviolence nationalism freedom and civil_rights there was laughter at his observation that most americans suffer from an edifice complex but mr killens was quite serious chuck has never listened to black writers unless they said what he wanted to hear the negro revolt is part and parcel of a worldwide revolution our literature should have social relevance to the world struggle and especially to the struggle of black americans killens cited the black artists responsibility for debrainwashing he then told of a session with a group of civil_rights workers that convinced him of the necessity for social relevance in literature the appearance later saturday evening of then sncc executive secretary james forman subsequently provided impetus for the conference authors halsey and gilden agreed that literature should have relevance to the social revolution but they were equally sensitive to certain hazards and limitations involved gilden charged novelists with the responsibility to present negroes without distortion as full fledged characters and was especially vehement in his appeal god forbid politics or social convictions influencing the work of the writer miss halsey warned that despair is inverted energy and contended that the writer must liberate energy although they did not deny that america is a racist society panelists halsey and gilden attributed this for the most part to the ignorance of white americans and miss halsey who was not present for the previous nights session introduced more hero debate this time in the form of sonny liston provoked by those contentions william melvin kelley led the questions which were of course comments as well from the floor fully bearded and sporting dark glasses prompting the question from at least one observer is that leroi jones novelist kelley stood held his notes in front of him and began what would be a very vocal weekend that left more than one observer puzzled my comments are directed at the two white panelists opened kelley you assume white people are ignorant i do not believe this exploitation has been unconscious you know  alluding to ignorance as suggested by the two panelists kelley called it part of the liberal mechanismthe cop out it was difficult to believe that the same man who wrote the ivy league negro for esquire magazine a couple of years ago was talking when he explained in detail to miss halsey why sonny liston was a hero to the black cats in watts adding that he liston is not roy wilkins suggesting that the nation is a victim of calvinistic protestantism as he would reiterate all weekend kelley suggested that progress can only be achieved by overthrowing christianity as we know it pressed with regard to his agreement with redding on baldwins character rufus gilden acknowledged his agreement which led to a discussion of exactly what kind of  character should engage sympathy a member of the audience accused redding and gilden of basing their conclusions on white western cultures imposed values and concepts of dignity he told them that art was meaningless if artists failed to discover meaningful ways of relating it to the problems of people and asserted that black people might still be oppressed  years from now and if your art has not helped them it will be little more than a selfish possessionin fact a part of their exploitation gilden pressed the speaker for an explanation as to the values he was speaking of and asked what he would replace them with the answer was all values relating to economics which are the only ones respected in america must be replaced gilden later told a small group that there was no such thing as selfhatred among negroes which prompted someone to ask if his current novel will include negroes his affirmative response prompted the advice that he not attempt to create a negro character until you find out something about negroes by this time the enormous gap between the way white and black americans view the world was revealing itself both in and out of the official conference sessions the saturday afternoon session treatment of the negro in the novel found william melvin kelley on a panel which included katya gilden and the south african novelist and short story writer richard rive mrs gilden observed the tendency of american novelists to create characters from the dominant group in society and to assume universality she contended that the late richard wright limited his work to terror and helplessness which excluded much of negro life once again there was subtle reference to the hero and heels debate when she accused writers of creating monsters claiming that they are produced by segregation and thereby providing segregationists with material that is used to maintain segregation ie i dont want to live around those kind of people one of the more eloquent presentations of the conference was that of richard rive an engaging man who speaks in lucid british tones and skillfully uses humor his treatise on the use or misuse of the black characters in south african literature was informative his incisive criticism spared none white nor black painfully naive was the label attached to alan patons black characters believing a touch of morality would solve the problem and mr rive noted that the same could be said of many american writers the function of any writer anywhere is to protestprotest the functions of men said rive the best known of contemporary nonwhite south african writers peter abrahams fell into rives category of writers who are busy protesting their status as individuals rather than asserting their right to be the line of protest subscribed to by rive it is noteworthy that leroi jones in an essay written some three years ago made a similar comment on abrahams accusing him of outbaldwinning james with the plea for understanding as an individual a separate entity  calling the novel a new art form william melvin kelley attributed the novels appearance to the appearance of the middleclass used to reflect the way they looked at their lives kelley proceeded to condemn capitalism created the middleclass the position relegated woman in the western world the pope renounced evil by renouncing woman and accused white people of trying to make malcolm_x a black beast one who seeks revenge when malcolm according to kelley didnt want to seek the revenge of the black beasthe wanted to rid himself of the white man kelley challenged the black writer to stop writing the protest novel and start writing the revolutionary novel and drew the loudest applause up to that point with his words stop writing imitation white novels to white people and start writing to black people mrs gilden asked if she agreed with kelleys remarks answered yes which begs the question whether or not one can write to black people as kelley suggests successfully while taking care not to create characters that segregationists will use to maintain segregation as suggested by mrs gulden the absence of leroi jones who was invited to the conference was frequently mentioned prior to saturday evenings panel poetry from the negro renaissance till today but the poets on hand while paying tribute to the young bard along the way provided the conferences most stimulating session at the helm were two gentlemen who were not strangers to very many people in the audience arna bontemps and robert hayden and two other poets margaret walker and melvin b tolson who heretofore were strangers to much of the audiencealbeit for quite different reasons margaret walker whose poem for my people written in  won the yale prize for poetry has been teaching at jackson state college in jackson mississippi but her silence by no means resulted in her being behind the times as all would soon discover one attends a writers conference anticipating new ideas pertinent criticisms enhanced perspectives a touch of the inexplicable as well as the profoundbut one also secretly hopes for that person who  will rise to the occasion and provide the emotional stimulus that transforms writers conferences into good old down home baptist conventionsfor at least a little while that stimulus was provided by melvin b tolson poet laureate of liberia the man described by karl shapiro as the poet who writes in negrowhich then takes us to the reason mr tolson was a stranger to so many in the audience now yearsold m b tolson has been writing poetry since he was twelve and in the meantime has worked at a multitude of occupations that run right through the alphabet including such jobs as stevedore janitor boxer drama director organizer of sharecroppers unions newspaper columnist and fourterm mayor of langston oklahoma the home of langston college where he was for many years a professor the diversity of his life is reflected in both his poetry and talk and the fact that he remains largely unknown according to shapiro is not because he is difficult to read which he is for difficulty of text is the stockintrade of the poetryteaching profession tolson is not read because he is a negro    the white professional mind thinks that poetry is written by englishmen or their descendents and imitators nevertheless m b tolson in person shows none of the scars one anticipates from a man whose works were unjustly buried nor does the author of libretto for the republic of liberia rendezvous with america and harlem gallery in his dynamic approach to life and people reveal the effects of two recent serious operations returning to the panel what better choice than arna bontemps one might ask to bring us from those strolling twenties to these searing sixties he was on board all the way like our music our poetry is hard to pin downlikely to be marked with a special riff opened bontemps he remarked that although it followed the english tradition it did not hold it sacred a composed bontemps read poems from the days of the harlem renaissance written by his contemporaries he lauded the current younger poets but found none as precocious as langston hughes paul lawrence dunbar and countee cullen and observed that sterling brown is unsurpassed as a reader of tales the longtime fisk librarians attachment to and admiration for an old friend langston hughes was apparent throughout and along the route he warmly referred to the works of his fellow panelists citing robert haydens a ballad of remembrance published in england in  he informed the audience that the book was awarded a prize at the world festival of negro arts which was concluding in dakar senegal in unison with the fisk conference one gets the idea hayden doesnt want to be labeled a negro poet doesnt exactly like that negro thing added bontemps but in his comment there was a touch of compassion and a world of understanding obviously he was speaking of a man he respected he informed the audience of margaret walkers forthcoming novel jubilee the first civil war novel to be written by a negro and said of tolson only recently was he fully recognized observing that racial awareness emerges from almost every line written by tolson allowing that the younger poet is epitomized by the fiery leroi jones bontemps hastened to add that there are others he considers just as important including m carl holman james emmanuel julian bond and dudley randall the detroit bard essayist and short story writer who attended the conference margaret walker capturing her audience with the gleaming brightness of a most friendly smile alluded to the twenties praising jean toomer a sensitive driver james weldon johnson erudite gentlemantalented poet and others of the era the thirties according to miss walker found the black poet brutalized stigmatized and ostracized her presentation included kind words for pulitzer prize winner gwendolyn brooks and the contention that leroi jones dominates the sixties because he has something to say labeling jones the rew inventor miss walker called his language new startling and bold adding that you must read a great deal of jones to really understand him to which saunders redding echoedbut not for all to hear an awful lot i have said this until i almost think ill choke and fall over backwards thus began a visibly disturbed robert hayden addressing himself to the argument as to whether one is a negro poet or as hayden insists a poet who happens to be a negro reading lines from yeats hayden solemnly commented i didnt have to be irish to love those lines lets quit saying were black writers writing to black folksit has been given importance it should not have haydens anticipation of opposition gave way to a slight stutter i dont think were consciously trying to escape his sensibility shaken to the point of anger hayden continued please notice thisall you folks sitting out there waiting to jump down my neck he proceeded to define poetry as the beauty of perception given form  the art of saying the impossible the works of gloria oden previously unmentioned were praised by hayden miss oden is the new york poetlawyer who recently reminded negro writers of their privileged status in this republic while reprimanding them for failing to appeal for understanding from a predominantly white audience at  last years writers conference at the new school in new york hayden concluded by informing those from whom he expected opposition on the matter of identity if they didnt accept his position baby thats your problem not mine the associate professor of english at fisk created a perfect setting for the entrance of mr tolson with just a touch of drama tolson spun a yarn around the fact of his not having brought a written text and waltzed right into a reflection of a visit to an old poets grave whereupon there was engraved on the tombstone  am dead as all can see ye bear you all to follow me pausing his head tilt back as though in deep meditation tolson said that the words on the tombstone made him think and then respond to follow you im not content until i know which way you went and as laughter filled the hall tolson rose from his chair with the energy of one of his pupils and in a sweeping gesture and a booming voice that rocked jubilee hall he roared nobody writes in a vacuum or out of a vacuumwhen a man writes he tells me which way he went in society the audience now spellbound listened as the man who might affectionately be called the grandfather of the conference spoke of the tridimensionality of man a man has his biology his sociology and his psychologyand then he becomes a poet  glancing over his shoulder at hayden the grin on his face reminiscent of a mischievous lad once again tolsons tone was soft almost reverent hap hap  let me see hap means accident is someone going to make m b tolson an accident youll never make me an accident and by this time his voice was blazing to the rafters as he exclaimed im a black poet an africanamerican poet a negro poet im no accidentand i dont give a tinkers damn what you think signs of tolson the educator mixed with the poet the dramatist and what have you as he gave a discourse on the word negro starting with its beginning as an adjective and advancing to its origin as a noun at the hands of the portuguese in senegal observing that there was no stigma attached to it until the coming of christian civilization tolson blamed capitalism for the worlds race problem he alluded to a play written by leroi jones the toilet suggesting that this country for all its criticism and controversy did not really understand what mr jones was talking about that young man is a symbol of the times said tolson everyone thinks he was talking about a toilet in harlem he wasnt talking about a toilet in harlemhe was talking about an entire civilization that has become a commode when the intellectuals and the artists condemn a civilization that doesnt mean that that civilization is in troubleit means its on its way out as expected the panel discussion inspired talk from the floor concerning the question of identity among the concerned was the graying james forman once the baby faced member of the civil_rights big four i think the question of whether or not one identifies himself as a negro writer has bearing on the choice of material one writes about said forman the irrepressible sncc veteran called attention to the fact that many negro writers fail to address themselves to the struggle of black people in this country suggesting that this was in part due to a lack of identity observing that little has been written about the southern freedom movement excepting the sensationalismoriented newspaper accounts and occasional magazine articles forman contended that an awful lot of negro writers are completely out of touch with the movement defending the writers cause miss walker promised that sunday afternoons poetry reading would include new poems relating to the southern freedom movement citing the example of dubois voluminous writings during his days as an activist bontemps raised the question of the small quantity of writing done by the modern day activists voicing his amazement at this point a member of the audience explaining that he was formerly a movement activist and is now a sometime writer suggested that the analogy of dubois to the current civil_rights workers was not quite fair as each of you writers know the creative exercise is a painful one well i just want to say that those involved in the movement and i dont mean those who occasionally picket are involved in an exercise as painful as writing many of the activists have written articles for various magazines but to ask them to do a great deal of writing would be asking too much of any man the speaker obviously impatient with the inability of his voice to keep pace with his thoughts next addressed himself to hayden mr hayden i dont think jim forman is questioning your ability to identify yourself as a negro you said that you didnt think you were consciously trying to escape but is it not true that perhaps you are unconsciously trying   but before he could finish hayden interrupted saying that he was tired of being attacked at every writers conference insisting that he have his say the speaker asserted the question of whether or not you identify yourself as a poet who happens to be a negro or as a negro poet does have effect on the students who come in contact with you at this university it is a fact that many young black people leave fisk terribly deluded and someone is responsible for their delusion i am suggesting that you do have a re sponsibility to them a responsibility to help them understand that they will become black poets black teachers or what have youand whether you like it or not that is your problem baby    the conference momentum was in full gear as the playwrights alice childress loften mitchell and william branch assembled sunday morning for the final panel what are the dramatists saying the woes of the black playwright in america were articulated by william branch who suggested that today in new york there is less chance than  or  years ago of the black playwright being produced loften mitchell read an essay from black drama a book of essays he is writing on the american negro in the theatre depicting the oppressive conditions under which the black playwright is forced to function born in harlem a stones throw from jimmy baldwin mitchell an earthy character who exudes youthful humor suggested that we havent gotten free yet we got integratedthe double doublecross his label for integration caught on and was heard late into the night branch suave pipe smoking contended that things cant get worse and asserted that we can no longer wait for the white brother to come to his senses we must establish black theatre not shutting anyone out but looking inside our own experiences    whitey just aint gonna do it babywere going to have to do it proudly exclaiming im from harlem and i am a negro writer alice childress affectionately stated all i know of generosity and kindness and love i learned in harlem imagine a rose saying im not a rose im a flower well i am a rose and a flower i am a negro writer and also a part of universal man and with those words the author of trouble in mind cast an intense warmth throughout the hall miss childress blamed white america for the fact that the negro artist cannot earn a living in his field and accused the oppressors of also telling us how to react to the oppression she concluded that she believes all mankind should have the opportunity to become his highest self the question and answer session consisted mostly of an exchange between william melvin kelley and panelists branch and childress concerning the subject of federal monies the two panelists especially miss childress spoke extensively of federal monies available to the arts advising negro artists to take advantage of them kelleys position was that it would be useless to depend upon federal money because the man is not going to give you money and let you destroy his system the bearded intellectual author of a different drummer and a drop of patience warned against falling into what he called the capitalistic bagthinking money will set you free the general tone of the entire discussion reflected recognition of the need to utilize federal funds but not without an awareness of the possible inhibitions and limitations inherent in accepting such money after finally getting the floor which by then was becoming a problem james forman explained that his reason for attending the conference was to present some specific areas in which he felt his organization could work together with the writers and expressed hope that there could be a fruitful dialogue between the artists and the activists before the conference adjourned john killens then suggested that a special meeting be held immediately following the closing address by ossie davis a suggestion which met with enthusiasm from the audience sunday afternoons poetry reading session was a moving experience reading from harlem gallery and his exciting collection of african proverbs tolson delighted the crowd before hastily departing to a writers conference at princeton university reading his very pensive full moon robert hayden masterfully engaged his audience humbly expressing satisfaction with his prize winning a ballad of remembrance his reading from it as well as others of his poems was received with a warm appreciation that was a tribute to his artistry i think the activists lend an electric effect to this conference stated arna bontemps as he dedicated his poem the daybreakers to the determined young people the audience seemed to share bontemps nostalgia as he read works untarnished by the passing years there was in the closing lines of his poem golgotha is a mountain a certain spiritual ecstasy and subtle powerblack men should own those mountains and l am one of them living up to her promise margaret walker read poems dedicated to her late friend and neighbor medgar evers as well as poems to malcolm_x and the three young mississippi martyrs cheney goodman and schwerner the suffering and struggle of black people were the ingredients for her work now    time to wipe away the slime time to end this bloody crime and the spunky i like it fine here in jail following the poetry session john killens was honored with a book party for his volume of essays black mans burden in a tribute to the stem but jovial writer father woodruff called him   fully integrated and free there is no smallness in the man it was standing room only in jubilee hall sunday evening for the conference finale ossie davis the actorplaywright was intro duced by killens as one who is concerned about where were going and how were going to get there addressing himself to the theme of the conference davis spoke of the importance of images recalling that some years ago the then senator lyndon baines johnson said that he could not subscribe to sending troops into southeast asia to fight a white mans war davis observed that johnson thereby created an image citing this nations present involvement in vietnam he contended that it necessitated johnsons creating a new image and the new image he sought was to make it a black mans war and that is the reason  per cent of the american troops in vietnam are black the applause delayed his continuing images said mr davis must correspond to some accepted reality upon which people communicate and agree davis contended that we must find new images that correspond to the objective facts of our lives  we must seek new languagefor the language of uncle tom like uncle tom himself is dead the audience roared approval when he praised malcolm_x saying that the late leader had advanced to the point where he thought like an africanamerican citing malcolms having moved the struggle from civil_rights to the question of human rights davis asserted that malcolm knew that we must organize friends in africa so that anytime a foot stepped on a black man on one continent a black mans mouth would yell in the other revolution calls for the black man to break away as the son from the father said davis and for determining which image will prevail will it be the image of the middleclass honorary white man asked davis such an image according to the author of purlie victorious has a need for nonviolence it is the image that says we can make it with education cleanliness politeness and he observed that such an image still prevails in most of our universities adding that it also says please dont mix civil_rights with peace davis continued i would like to think that american society is basically sound and that we can reform it i would like to think that i could come through the gates and rise with everyone else but with his mind seemingly immersed in the reality of todays america he stated integration comes too late because the reason we are in this country has been taken out from under us by automation citing the history of the united states the fact that black people were brought to these shores as a source of cheap labor davis chronicled the times up to the present today three out of four negro jobs the unskilled jobs are being taken away and this nation is in the unique position of having more workers producing services than goods davis pointed out the fact that black people have no value to the country in terms of the services produced and observed that america because it no longer depends upon the exportation of goods exports capitaland thats why were in vietnam and thats why well be in vietnam the dominican republic and south africa this country has vast business interest in south africa until the last black american is dead he concluded that the image of the middleclass honorary white man is not a satisfactory one suggesting that we must base our image on the dispossessed in our nations harlems davis advised that we must relate to other nations of the world who just happen to be nonwhite viewing the recent overthrow of kwame nkrumah in ghana davis refuted the reasons usually cited by the american press insisting that we consider the fact that cocoa ghanas leading source of revenue suffered a price drop from  cents a pound to  cents a pound nkrumah or no other man could hold a government together under that kind of pressure said davis and he left no doubt as to who he felt was responsible for the disaster we are artists who must dare to deal in truth but there was deep concern in his voice as he cautioned but be mindful that power when threatened will crush suggesting that we not waste time on petty hatred davis said that there are those on both sides who are dead to the future in a candid message to white americans he charged those of good will with the responsibility to go and become missionaries in their own communitieseducate that bigot and teach him that his fate is tied to mine alluding to the oftmentioned leroi jones davis called him a shattered young man saying that jones realizes what this culture has done to his people and knows that we must create a new language do you know asked davis that because of the connotation the word black has in this culture when you look at your child and call him black you have already insulted him  different ways davis then advised the audience to consult rogets thesaurus where they would find about  words of negative connotation opposite the word black as opposed to about three opposite the word white leroi jones is aware of these facts said davis contending that we must arrive at a new image davis said it must have elements based on the man in the gutter and it must appeal to him if we accomplish this the writer will be the father of a new country davis concluded that black people in the face of oppression once came up with john henryand now it is your challenge to go home and do for automation what john henry did for the steam drill john killens made the closing observation that he was glad to see james forman and the activists at the conference because they know the importance of obtaining a new image and creating a new language among those present was cleveland sellers sncc program director speaking on behalf of the fisk university writers workshop mignon k holland an aspiring novelist expressed gratitude for the foresight and dedication of resigning fisk president stephen j wright without whom john killens brainchild would not have become a reality the conference officially closed but as planned the meeting of the minds continued in the post conference session resulting in plans for a meeting of artists and activists to be held in new york in june it was the first writers conference conducted on the campus of a major negro university and will rightfully take its place in historical annals  
a days living
by dolores armstead
t the top of the staira p way nell stood listeng ing for her daughters  voice there was no sound the child was still asleep go now she intoned as she slowly descended the flight of wet and slippery stairs across the street three sister buildings gaped and shrank together as icecored snow fell through their demolished roofs down the razed skeletons to where furnaces had croaked up warmth for the flesh of a few aged jews and rooting puerto ricans nell ran in the beating snow impatiently bumping against the white hills of frozen garbage going in the direction of the subway at the essex street crossing she became aware of a whirwhir chaining close around her it was the snowplows moving in like battleships on the deep white sea her boots bleat as she darted in front of one of the scooping bullies the snow belting her face stung like stones but she could not turn back in her pocket were two subway tokens and she had to exchange them for thirty cents that would buy one quart of milk for her child past the winking neon of golds appetizers she ran then like the command of a master hypnotist the thing she feared asserted itself at the proper point of her mission she walked back to golds and gazed into the window there was only one clerk behind the counter the right one the three customers in the aisle were a dark fat blur nell entered the shop stood with her back to the candy and eyed the sturgeon once she had bought strings of licorice here and as before there seemed something comic about the wizened herring in their pickling barrels reposing ruefully across the aisle from pastel mints and bon bons the clerk deftly rolled a pound of fish in thick wrappings for a bent old man while two girls fussed over sweets ill be right with you the clerk said to nell she turned away not yet willing to meet his eyes she felt cold and numb and she wished for a warming drink yet she wanted her cold insides to freeze every instinct that might betray the approaching tide of lies when the customers left the clerk walked up the aisle toward her i came to ask a favor of you nell blurted as if to stall his approach whereve you been the clerk said around she said slowly gaining control i feel awfully silly asking she smiled prettily but will you give me thirty cents for these two subway tokens the tokens gleamed on the brown palm of her glove why didnt you come back that night i wasoh kind of scared she answered still with the guarded innocent smile scared of me i waited for you i looked in the streets for you believe me youve been on my mind since that one night you came in the store nearly drove me crazy when you didnt come back like you said you shouldnt do something like that he held her arm as if she might fly or sink im sorry nell sighed shaking  her scarf to her shoulders but ive got a kid you see shes two and i didnt have anyone to stay with her that night he passed his hand over her hair and nell felt a thickening at her scalp as if the roots were kinking from sweat are you married he asked sseparated she said not knowing if it was the truth or a lie id like to see you could i visit you sometime i supposebut my husband pops up every now and then we could go out dinner a show ill pay your sitter i dont know anybody around here to get for a sitter whos with the kid now i left her sleeping she said i had to come out look will you do me a favor and give me thirty cents for these two tokens you need change i need milk for my baby she rapped this darned blizzard were practically starving her thoughts strayed to herman he couldnt leave the baby he was a good father to the baby even when they fought hell come back she reasoned just as soon as the storm breaks the clerk put two quarts of milk in a paper bag were one of the few places still got milk in this blizzard no delivery what else you want you can have anything in the store only milk she said craving the expensive sturgeon  take some candy to the kid he put chocolate covered jellies and mints into a bag and placed the packages beside her whats your name nell she said nellie he chuckled reaching for her hand my names sol lets go in the back of the store nellie show you my office slowly she trudged to the rear he turned to face her his eyes were large and pale as a shadow they grew large and urgent as an alms plate he was a lonely man he was married hed had a summer affair with another colored girl like you nellie with fire in her eyes data related like routine instructions before an examination nell looked around for a chair he pulled her close she had to keep back the tears he didnt want her for back alleys she was beautiful he wanted to help her he had to have her nell drooped with the blow of a migraine as he alluded to intimacy they could enjoy kiss me nellie she leaned stiffly toward him and he pressed his body against her she rubbed a trembling hand against his chest fighting not to push him away youre my girl he said sol i she could think of nothing to say and she could no longer smile what would you do if the store was closed and i had you here with me how can i get in touch with you if she leaned against the crates that lined the wall of the narrow room heres my card sol said call me tomorrow around seven he took her hand and led her back to the front of the store nell looked around at the fish and the bon bons she buttoned her coat and tied the scarf in a hard knot under chin sol she began slowly will you give me the money for these tokens he dug into his pocket here take this no she said looking at the folded bill just exchange the tokens please fair trade go on take it he insisted i want to help you ok thanks she took the folded bill stuck it inside her glove with his card thank you for the milk and candy too we can work things out he said youll see ill treat you nice you call me tomorrow i think youre very kind with a measure of compassion she looked into his eyes searching for a glint of light among the shadowy grey a woman swathed in mink entered the shop and sol was at once behind the counter glancing at nell only an instant more nell gathered her packages and slipped away the cold the snow and tears bit into her cheeks she unfolded the bill he had given her a dollar she could buy a little food 
why harlem needs a cultural center
by dr esther jackson
 harlem need a cultural center the answer is obviously yes in the sixties we in america are beginning to recognize that the arts are a necessary element of all human experience a component as basic to the lifeprocess as food shelter or clothing the arts are not forms of decoration they relate to the entire process of human learning to the total pattern of mans imaginative symbolic and creative activity when we speak of the arts therefore we do not restrict our consideration to conventional forms  such as painting sculpture literature dance and drama we refer to the entire range of created symbols which give concrete shape to human consciousness not simply architecture and painting but also roads bridges and trestles not merely sculpture and crafts but also spacecraft and missiles not alone poetry music and dance but also equations theorems and propositions not only scenery and costumes but also furniture jewelry and dress we are in short concerned with the whole of mans created life with his rituals myths images social structures and patterns of intellectual life as well as with his expressive forms indeed those forms which we describe as theatre music literature dance and the plastic arts are but the expressions of a larger and more complex pattern of activity which is at once individual and collective in nature the chief function of the arts is to give shape to the complete world of human experience but the arts have a second function in society they are not only charged with signifying the basic content of experience they are in many senses a technique of discovery the arts are lenses through which men see interpret and evaluate experience it is because of this intimate relationship to seeing and knowing that they are so important to us at this point in american history we owe to the great philosopher john deweyamong othersa better understanding of the role of the arts in the intellectual social psychological and moral growth of the individual dewey described the function of the arts as instrumental for they not only reflect what the creator thinks about reality they affect the way in which other individuals interpret that same reality the influence of the arts as a moral agent has concerned writers from the time of plato to our own day what may be even more important in this discussion however is the effect of the arts on the total process of learning contemporary theories of learning would seem to support the contention that many intellectual skills understandings and knowledges have their origins in the arts that the symbolic structure of the arts is fundamental to all learning we contend that the acquisition of learning in fields as seemingly dissimilar as mathematics literature and the social sciences is de pendent in large measure on a single factor the presence of a mature flexible and appropriate system of symbols an individual cannot think about indeed perhaps cannot even recognize thingsinthemselves unless he has within his imagination a clear and appropriate symbol intellectual development and growth seem thus to be dependent on the quality maturity accuracy and reliability of symbolic structures it is in large measure through exposure to the arts that primary symbolic structures develop art is not then a decorative exterior applied to the surface of experience it is rather the concrete evidence of a way of viewing reality it follows that every individual like every community has such a pattern that is to say every individual like every communityhas an imaginative structure through which it sees interprets and evaluates life in such a structure we may find a critical measure of the intellectual social psychological and moral values of the community every individual in every community reads some kinds of literature wears some kinds of clothes and jewelry participates in some kinds of rituals shares some myths lives in some kind of architecture enjoys some dramatic experiences hears music creates verse develops ideas and finally seeks to find beauty harmony truth and meaning in his life that which distinguishes one kind of arts structure from another is not motive rather it is the quality of those created forms which the individual and society jointly evolve art may thus be sophisticated or naive lifeaffirming or lifenegating harmonious or disordered subjective or objective immature or highly developed misleading or enlightening permanent in value or frankly topical in general then we may say that the arts mirror the stage of development to which the communitylike the individual creatorhas come  we in the harlem community today are not as much concerned with this representational aspect of the arts as we are with their effect upon the individual and the group for we recognize the arts as an unequalled teaching device which speaks not only of those concrete truths which are the province of the sciences but also of those ambiguous and elusive forms of understanding which affect human behaviour at its unreasoning roots if the sciences and the social sciences speak of those areas of human experience which are judged to be within the effective control of reason the arts are concerned with those areas of human behaviour which are manifestly without the arts speak of those hidden areas of human consciousness in which our drives have their origin of love and hate fear and courage suffering and joy beauty and ugliness and of tranquility and violence moreover it is the arts which dare to speak of these areas of human behaviour with complete relevance accuracy and candour when we talk of a program in the arts for this community we are not speaking of a performance schedule nor do we conceive primarily of a building rather we look forward to the launching of a total community effort which will not only seek to mirror that stage of growth at which we now find ourselves but which will be concerned with the development of that kind of symbolic and imaginative activity which will improve and enhance the quality of our individual and collective experience such a program cannot concern itself entirely with the reflection of things as they are nor yet with the glorification of things as they were rather it must devote its attention to the creation of life as it ought to be we must ask ourselves what does such a program have to contribute to the improvement of life in the harlem community to greater political economic social and cultural opportunity to the constructive use of conflict to the development of better interpersonal relationships to the effective use of personal capabilities to the acceleration of individual achievements to the motivation of higher standards to the clarification of human problems to the projection of more desirable values to the creation of a physical environment of greater beauty to the stimulation of a greater sense of personal appreciation to the development of a sense of joy to the swift achievement of social justice an arts center in harlem should then provide a base for the projection of these universal values in the communityatlarge but such a center has in  an even more complex task for harlem is not an ordinary american community it is a community which has survived extended exploitation and which yet suffers social psychological economic and cultural ills which are reflected in the lives of its population one of the clear objectives of an arts program in such an area is to contribute to the eradication of the conditions of such exploitation the function of an arts center cannot be therefore to lock the doors of the community against the world rather the purpose of such a center must be to provide the residents of the community with such personal resources as will radically accelerate their potential growth and substantially increase their contact with the larger world clearly the emphasis of such a program must be on the young especially on that segment of the population which is less than  years of age the projected center cannot afford to develop programs which are restricted to the job interests and cultural patterns of older generations of harlemdwellers rather our clear mandate is to increase opportunity for the young by broadening the range and improving the quality of cultural experience the harlem center must not capitulate to the wellmeaning exponents of separate but equal art nor can it seek to repeat many patterns of programming which were successful in eras of more limited opportunity the harlem center must not be seen as an alternative to participation in institutions such as the lincoln center or the new york shakespeare festival or the museum of modern art it ought not be regarded as an escape from our clear responsibility to insist on the speedy desegregation of career opportunities in the major cultural institutions of this and other cities in america rather the harlem cultural center should provide the negro community with an effective base from which its campaign to desegregate the arts in new york city and in americaatlarge may be effectively launched it would seem to me then that the proposed center has five specific functions  to support the formal educational process by providing the citizens of the harlem community with a representative selection of the finest examples of world art  to offer systematic assistance to gifted young people in the development of their own talents  to expose all young people to that basic arts experience which is fundamental to creative achievement in all professions and careers and which is an essential instrument in the pursuit of happiness  to equip young people with those verbal and intellectual skills aesthetic concepts and moral values which we in america believe to be prerequisite to professional and personal advancement in the world of the twentieth century  to provide a home for the large community of gifted performers who have failed to gain appropriate opportunities and rewards because of discriminatory practice in the arts and at the same time to offer broader opportunities to gifted performers of all racial and ethnic groups  to demonstrate that desegregation in the arts may be achieved in america to the advantage of the artist the profession the spectator and the nationatlarge how can these objectives be achieved certainly the establishment of a program of such comprehensive intent requires an apparatus of great efficiency there are subsumed in these objectives four areas for immediate action  professional and preprofessional training  audience education  social and educational services  community action if we are to realize our common goals for the center a plan for action in each of these four areas must precede the establishment of physical facilities such a plan should bring into effective and appropriate conjunction the activities of existent community structures certainly the program of the center should be viewed as a supplement rather than as an alternative to systematic arts education in the public school curriculum in the same way any proposed plan for professional and preprofessional training in the arts must be developed with regard for established standards of creative performance a different kind of coordination is required to develop a program which is supportive of the goals of social agencies and religious organizations and finally the center must assume the major role in our struggle to desegregate the arts particularly to open serious opportunities for career growth and development in those institutions which are partially or wholly supported by public subsidy the center both in terms of theory and example should serve as a lever in the larger struggle for cultural opportunity in american life from it should issue an intensive drive to insure systematic advancement in the arts for talented members of all minority groups but more than this the center must provide a plan of action which will not only advance the careers of performing artists but which will open career opportunities in the hundreds of supportive occupations associated with the arts the drive for equal opportunity in the arts must not be conceived alone to affect actors musicians painters dancers and writers but also designers technicians costumers business managers advertising copyists choreographers directors arrangers and museum workers clearly the key to these advances is community action an action which is not restricted to artists alone but which engages the efforts of our political and professional leadership in the nationatlarge for the future of the arts in our country will to a large degree be determined by the future of the arts in new york new york in many senses the cultural capital of the world is perhaps of unequalled importance as a symbol of the cause of unlimited human opportunity and so it is that the time for a civil_rights program in the arts has clearly come the necessity of such action becomes even clearer when we realize that vast new funds for the support of the arts will soon be available through legislative action the antipoverty bill the elementary and secondary education bill andwe hopethe arts and humanities bill promise to support the growth of the arts throughout the country the harlem community not only has a right it has a clear responsibility to insist that taxderived funds shall not be used to reenforce pervasive patterns of discrimination against negro artists spectators and school children 
festival postscripts
ie hopes that the story is apocryphal the way it goes the prime movers of the american committee for the first world festival of negro arts were considering which group of musicians to invite to dakar as exemplars of jazz music in america benny goodman and his sidemen were mentioned but it was remembered that the state department already had sent them on such a tour then woody herman and his orchestra were suggested and the idea was received with much enthusiasm but then someone asked the number of negroes in mr hermans current herd    as it turned out duke ellington and his orchestra were chosen as the musicians to carry the message of jazz to dakar but the above storywhether apocryphal or true tells much about the orientation of the american committee in the first place only a few thousand american negroes knew anything about either the american committee or the first world festival of negro arts itself for an event of such importance in the negro world this neglect was all but criminal the selection of mrs virginia innessbrown as chairman of the american committee was an incredibly obvious blunder mrs innessbrown is a wealthy new yorker with an avid interest in the theatre she has many friends in high places including the government in washington and she can call on these people for support in her charitable work apparently her concern for projects affecting negroes is genuine however that is not the point mrs innessbrown is white and it should be immediately clear to anyone with knowledge of contemporary realities that it simply is not appropriate that a white person be the head of a committee for a festival of negro arts not surprisingly then the same kind of thinking that went into the selection of a white person as chairman of the american committee was evident in the selecting of american participants in the festival there is no quarrel with the choice of duke ellington this great musician cannot be overhonored and his reception at dakar was eloquent proof of the acceptance of his work in the negro world however most of the other choices were less wise the american committee chose armenta adams a classical pianist and martina arroyo a soprano who recently appeared at the metropolitan opera and while both are fine artists they were all but wasted at dakar there is nothing particularly negro about a pianist playing bach preludes and a soprano singing verdi arias that they can perform this music superbly is one thing but the performance of it at a festival of negro arts is quite another the same observations are pertinent relative to the selection of leonard de paur and his chorus to appear at dakar mr de paur is a gentleman of superior intellectual and musical attainments but there is little that is negro about his musical presentation beyond the fact that he and most of the men in his chorus are black it is true that the chorus introduced a brace of african tunes enchantingly done  but that program would be infinitely more effective before an american or europeanor even japaneseaudience or for that matter before an african audience so long as the context is not one of negro arts africans do them more authentically it so happened that the most inspired choice of the american committee received the least adequate showcasing and consequently failed of potential impact marion williams and her gospel singers brought a measure of excitement to the festival but the group performed only in the cathedral of dakar which has poor acoustics and limited capacity misses adams and arroyo also appeared in the cathedral to unfortunate effect this amazonian woman and her rhythmic singing and clever showmanship captured the audience but the audience was primarily white with a sprinkling of upperclass africans the reason more than  per cent of the senegalese are moslems and the masses do not feel comfortable or welcome for that matterin a christian house of worship it was not the american committees fault that miss williams and her group were not scheduled for the seat daniel sorano theatre or for the outdoor stadium it was a question of priorities and the other american performersellington and de paur had higher priority however there was some embarrassment expressed by highly placed americans relative to the uninhibited performance of the gospel singers miss williams and her singers lacked dignity it was claimed and told that it was a pity that the masses of africans would not have the benefit of miss williams art one director of the festival a frenchman replied but what does it matter everyone of any importance is here at the cathedral everyone of any importance when the audience consisted of only a few hundred people most of whom were white such unfortunately were some of the attitudes which contributed to disappointments at the festival at the last minute the day before the festival ended the alvin ailey dancers appeared at the daniel sorano theatre andfrom all reportssalvaged the sagging prestige of the american representation mr aileys troupe arrived from rome substituting for the arthur mitchell dance group which due to lack of funds cancelled out it was in all probability a good thing that mr mitchell did not come mr mitchell is a fine ballet dancer but mr ailey whose forte is modern dancing is less oriented toward the classical mr ailey brought some fresh ethnic feeling to the festival the world festival of negro arts at dakar was billed as the first looking toward a similar festival every two years there is by no means any assurance that there will be a second festival but one hopes that there will be and if there is one hopes that the american committee for the festival will have a broader base and will include among its active members negroes who are interested in and who make an identification withthe ordinary negro people of this country last january in dakar mrs innessbrown was told that the american committee for the festival had failed to communicate with the general negro public those for whom such a festival would mean most in terms of education and spiritual regeneration a white new york public relations firm had been hired to publicize the festival and this firm proceeded in what must be its normal way of reaching its public no special effort was made to interest the negro press for instance in fact mrs innessbrown was told that the white public relations firm concentrated on white newspapers and magazines most of which are in new york and it was pointed out to her that the new york times for example had limited negro readership even in new york it also was pointed out to mrs innessbrown that the white press had scant interest in a world festival of negro arts a contention which was borne out by the paltry publicity accorded the festival in the american press only life magazine devoted more than minimal photo space to the festival and few papers besides the new york times and the washington post published more than a single report of the festival both time and newsweek ignored it it is inconceivable that the american press would have remained so indifferent to say a world festival of western white arts and mrs innessbrown was informed of this fact she disagreed as did the cultural attache of the american embassy at dakar but both learned that the american press indeed has limited interest in events concerning negroes despite the large negro readership in american cities the american committee worked closely with the state department in planning american participation in the festival and there is little question that this collaboration had a significant influence on the quality of the american representation the state department contributed at least  in the way of expenses rescuing the committee which failed utterly to find its minimum budget of   it is reported that the state department was at first reluctant to be identified with the festival on the grounds that its emphasis on negritude gave it racist overtones the us state department these days is all for integration the state department did agree to help the american committee and there was little doubt at dakar that the state departments assistance was crucial to the functioning of the american committee however there remains the question of whether state department collaboration is entirely desirable that question becomes especially pertinent if that collaboration also means endorsement and approval of artists and performers slated to participate in the festival would the state department approve the appearance of jazz musicians or blues singers who have been convicted as narcotics addicts for example or would writers who have consistently opposed the governments position in cuba the dominican republic and vietnam receive state department approval in both instances the answer is probablyand understandably no and yet such musicians and writers are likely to be among the negro artists who could bring to a world festival the essence of the negro experience in america mrs innessbrown also was told that many american negro artists were not participating in the festival because they objected to the fact that a white person was chairman of the american committee it was explained that there was not necessarily any specific objection to mrs innessbrown as a person but only to the fact of the chairman being white it did not seem appropriate unfortunately mrs innessbrown seemed to feel that the objections were personal during the discussion mrs inat thies detroit artist henri king visited atelier of friend papa ibra tall one of senegals top painters tall directs school of design and tapestry nessbrown made an important point which needs to be stated and accentuated she said that negroes generally do not support charitable or cultural projects andthe inference wasthat it was necessary that someone like herself take the helm in order to assure the success of such projects as the festival efforts had been made she said to collect from negroes some of the  budget necessary for the american committee but that negroes had contributed virtually nothing later several wellknown negroes in attendance at the festival were asked about mrs innessbrowns contention and they agreed that the lady indeed spoke the truth the wife of an american negro diplomat recalled the years when the naacp sought desperatelyand without successto collect funds from negroes only weeks earlier in chicago harry belafonte sidney poitier mahalia jackson and dick gregory had participated in a rally which raised more than   for civil_rights work and this was cited as an example of how negroes cooperated today when they were led to feel that they were involved in a project or movement this was an example it was said of how negroes feel and act now but is it if the chairmanship of the american committee for the second world festival of negro arts goes as it should to a negro will the  negroes in this country come to the support of the committee and assure it of enough money to send truly representative performers and artists to participate in the festival will they mrs innessbrown indicated that following the first world festival of negro arts she would keep the festival committee alive and perhaps organize something like a foundation to aid young negro artists in pursuing their studies and their crafts it is a laudable plan and it is hoped that it will be realized however if there is going to be another festival it also is hoped that efforts will be made to find some able negro to head the american committee it also is hoped that efforts will be made to involve the negro public in the festival the originators of the festival conceived it as a living illustration of the concept of negritude and the negroes of americamore than those of any other country or continentneed to understand and to give attention to that concept hoyt w fulle 
who needs negro digest
with so many other magazines on the marketfrom the big slick picture magazines to the thin intellectual journalssuch a magazine as negro digest might appear almost irrelevant but who nowadays calls the negros aspirations writings thoughts and actions irrelevant this is what negro digest is all about negro digest is the only such magazine that frankly reveals what the people of color arc doing saying and thinking as reflected in its articles essays general features short stories forums informational notes poetry and priceless humor negro oigl provides an outlet for wellknownas well as the new and young articulate writers and thinkers and provides a source for those seeking negro historical facts guidance and information important to ones wellbeing perhaps this is why negro digest has been called the most stimulating magazine on the market by teachers housewives professionals and others who are aware in the true sense of the word who needs negro digest not every person but then not every person dares to think honestly and creatively about shaping his own destiny improving the lives of others or changing even a small corner of the world in which he lives such thoughts are too uncomfortable they have been known to start revolutions
