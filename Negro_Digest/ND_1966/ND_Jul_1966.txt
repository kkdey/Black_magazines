the new breed 
by peter 
oday within the black ghettoes of america a new genera ¦  tion is making its presence felt its presence has farreaching j implications for the survival of the society at large yet has § r  not been sufficiently described and explained by the many  ¦ ¦ observers and writers of the black communities but perhaps the best way to understand it is not through the works of writers and scholars but through certain changes occurring within the fertile music of the black comunities rythmn and blues gospels and spirituals and to a lesser extent jazz comprise some of the most significant components of black culture in america within their sounds and lyrics are contained all the hurt pain and good times which black people share through their daily experiences there is hardly an area of community life which escapes the contact of this music and the musicians and vocalists through their sounds have come to function as powerful agents of moral and cultural influence on black behavior black music then is an integral thread which knits together invigorates and gives substance to the personal and collective experiences of the black masses however since world war ii and particularly since the midfifties important changes have begun to take place within black music the rhythms have become more varied and complex black artists are getting more and more way out with their sounds the form and expression of black music is taking off in all kinds of directions these changes can be readily seen in jazz with the emergence of such artists as ornette coleman albert ayler archie shepp and sun ra leroi jones writes how one of these artists wants to play past note and get them purely into sound    into the basic element the clear emotional thing freed absolutely from antiemotional concept another more important change has been in the direction of a fusion between the blues and the spirituals it is now practically impossible to distinguish between the two the spirituals now contain the big beat and the blues the cries and humming of the spirituals the whole career of the late sam cooke in fact exemplifies this blend starting out with a gospel group the soul stirrers he later branched into rythmn and blues and continued to record and influence music in both areas until his death however the big hit the night time is the right time by ray charles and the raylettes is probably the prime single example of the blend between gospels and the blues produced in  it marked the complete popularization of the gospelblues sound in the black community that sound so prevalent today is clearly distinct from the blues of earlier years the clovers the orioles charles brown and particularly the older country blues singers were producing a more secular song some of the older country blues singers in fact have reacted strongly against the more spiritual oriented blues singers of today it is well known how upset big bill broonzy was over ray charles as he said of ray hes got the blues hes crying sanctified hes mixed the blues with the spirituals i know thats wrong the mixture of the spirituals and blues the new expressions in jazz all are indications of deeply rooted ferment within black culture old forms are being discarded or improvised upon new different and freer forms are being created recently there was a side out called the new breed james brown in his hit recording papas got a brand new bag refers to a new breed beneath the pulsating changes in black music one can feel the absorption of new ingredients into black life one can discern the emergence of a new breed of black man making his influence felt over the black ghetto it behooves us then to ask who is this new breed what conditions have gone into his formation what kind of consequences does his presence have for the society at large what in effect is the new breed saying one way to begin to identify the emerging generation is through statistics reliable statistics tell us that one of the fastest growing population components in the united states today is the negro now living in cities who was also born in cities before world war ii most blacks lived in the rural south and most of those who did live in the north had been born in the south they all had direct contact with the south but today we find a completely new phenomenon large rapidly growing black populations who are indigenous to city life these homegrown urban populations while rural and southern in the culture transmitted by parents relatives and friends have had no direct contact with the rural south they are subjected to the rigorous ordeal of the urban way of life from birth and in that sense truly represent the new negro yet the statistics cannot give a complete picture for they omit the cultural social and human experiences which surround the emergence of urban blacks to get into a broader and deeper area of facts one must inquire into the black world itself into the belief and authority structures that have held together the black community in america every nation tribe or natural community is ruled less by external forces from without than by internal forces from within compulsive internal images in the form of beliefs and moralities deeply embedded in the collective experiences which a natural group has shared in common i  regulate behavior among the members of the group and achieve thereby a necessary amount of cohesion and cooperation without which the group could not survive it is these internal laws generally called customs folkways and mores which make a person feel most comfortable among his own kind and less so among outsiders the security and reliability which they furnish to ones environment enables the development of his personality every man owes his life his moral and material condition to his family and nation for it is through these groups that he becomes human born helpless and dependent he wins control over himself only through the education and sustenance given him by his people our purpose here is to inquire into some of the vital internal forces that have traditionally structured the black community in america outside of a few exceptional cases it is widely acknowledged that black people from slavery to at least world war ii lived in a severely limited isolated and relatively static world the status of the black man at the bottom of white society was well defined and strongly entrenched the general orientation of his life and of his subjective mind was that which had been shaped by the slavelike conditions of the southern plantation system although after world war i many black people migrated to cities even those in the cities remained by and large a southern people the moral habits and cultural norms internalized in their consciences were essentially the same as those shared by their relatives and friends left remaining in the south the particular belief structures which we want to bring out are those buttressed by two prevailing authorities that of the church and that of the white ruling powers christianity as taught and administered by the folk and storefront preachers has always provided the dominant religious nourishment for the spiritualistic black masses the church its teachings and its activities have been not only the main religious institution but also one of the major social institutions of the black community now this is not to say that all black people went to church and lived by the bible for there has always been a large element of black sinners who have lied stolen and done wrong but the point is that even they did not really escape the church influence under which most of them came up in fact in most cases they probably looked upon themselves as sinners and almost certainly would never have challenged the divine authority of jesus or the bible life had just become too cruel and hard for them to remain in the church or to live according to its teachings they were wrong and knew it but if they ever decided to live right or if there ever was a right way to live it would be by the teachings of the church just as the divine authority of jesus was rarely questioned so was the authority of the white people to rule black people rarely questioned the black masses were so downtrodden so poor illiterate and ignorant and the white mans power over them so omniscient that any thought of their rising to an equal status with the white man could not possibly have been taken serious for long whether it was at home at church at work in the schools in government or in business the authority of the white man hovered over their lives it was always he who held the main strings to their well being in such a situation there was little alternative left for the black man except to acquire a slave mentality to look upon himself as inferior and upon the white man as superior and to accept the white way of doing things as the right way after all such an outlook corresponded to almost everything which he observed and experienced in real life true there were sporadic black rebellions but none of these seriously threatened the dominant position of the white powers in the end they probably only confirmed to most blacks that it would be impossible to break down the white mans domination over them the prevailing authorities of the church and the white man then were two dominant pillars of the traditional black world the beliefs and moralities which they imprinted upon black behavior severely constricted and stunted the mental and moral development of the black population however between the preworld war ii period and now many things have come to pass the depression two major wars erratic but large scale occurrences of industrialization and urbanization economic and employment stagnation etc it would be impossible to measure the influence which all these complex societal forces had upon the black community but one result is obvious namely that most black people have acquired a different basis for the existence of their community life this basis the slums of large american cities was to prove quite different from the type of life which black people knew previously in the agricultural south in the industrial cities the black people would have to adjust to more complex but still oppressive conditions of life the most farreaching consequence of this adjustment has been the breakdown in the traditional authority and belief structures of the black ghetto today the church and ruling white authorities no longer hold the grip they once held on the minds of the black population the christianity preached under the slave conditions of the south simply can not have any relevance or real meaning to the black youth coming up under the complex industrial systems of the cities young people today often know more about the world around them than do the preachers the religious teachings of the black preachers have now become no more than a means of deluding the ignorant black masses so that the preachers themselves can become rich new college trained sociologist preachers are attempting to fill the vacuum left by the increasingly outcast uneducated preachers but their formal style and presentation has no real attraction to black tastes thus the influence of the black church has steadily decreased as black preachers have failed to keep up with the time and demands of the younger generation another development of equal if not more significance is the rise to prominence of other religious groups particularly the nation of islam although these groups may not have been very successful in recruiting great numbers of negroes into their fold they have been very effective in disseminating their special ideas this means that they have questioned and repudiated some of the basic tenets of black christianity arguments against the divinity of jesus and the bible and the justice of the christian god which previously would have been taboo are now circulating freely within the black community and the result is easy to see a typical black youth today does not believe that he was bom into a world of sin that jesus died  years ago for his salvation and that if he lives right now he will go to heaven when he dies if anything instead of believing that he owes god something he believes that god owes him something young people want to enjoy life now and are not prepared to suffer and endure as their parents did unaccustomed and unable to meet these requirements of the young generation the spiritual authority of the black church like the influence of its preachers has diminished the other belief structure to fall has been that of the authority of white domination as james baldwin has put it the american negro can no longer nor will he ever be controlled by white americas image of him the mental subjection the nigger stigma which the white power structure had imposed upon the black man is now a thing of the past a new pride in being black is growing lightskinned negroes who might formerly have tried to pass for white are now glad to be black negroes no longer conceive of the world as one in which the white man has to be on the top and the black man on the bottom for today there are black nations in africa and a powerful yellow nation in asia moreover militantly charismatic and popular leaders such as malcolm_x have revealed to the masses the responsibility of the white power structure for their downtrodden condition the white mans treachery hypocrisy and deceit in his exploitation of the black man has been brought into the open and his significance in a world populated by the darker races has been belittled thus the determination of the us government and military to win the war against the yellow people in vietnam tends to confirm the now prevalent opinion in the black community that the white man will do almost anything to maintain his domination over the darker races the black world has changed so dramatically since before world war ii that it would be impossible for a youth coming up today to have the same view of the world and himself which his father had in the turbulent lawless cities of america the rhythm of life is quicker and more varied and complex for the masses life becomes a game in which one has to learn at an early age to be flexible to scheme and hustle if he is to survive use or be used stay one up on people or theyll take advantage of you besides this necessity of scheming in order to make it one also becomes exposed and attracted to a wide variety of social sets storefront churches hustling on the streets with pimps and prostitutes black college crowds integrated civilrighters and beatniks the fingerpopping and good times groups black nationalists when one moves between any of these sets he has to go through changes he has to change roles to change his game so that he can get in on a particular set from hustle to hustle from set to set such is the pace of black life in the cities the chaos and disorder which is a part of it makes it easy to understand why some of the new jazz sounds are becoming chaotic for after all in these sounds the musicians are often expressing no more than the various personal experiences which they have known in the disorder of american living conditions it is also easy to understand how the spirituals become mixed up with the blues the black singers coming up through the church take their singing but not the religion serious eventually the forces of black life on the streets pull them into the world of secular music and they carry their church sound and feeling and sometimes even the church moralities into the blues the tense fast driving demands of the rat race in modern america is pushing negroes to do things which their fathers never would have thought of doing and this is changing their music and their whole way of life on the streets the young headshakers used to just talk aloud drink wine and steal from and fight among each other today besides drinking wine they are getting loaded on weed and other things instead of fighting among one another they are stabbing white people on the subways it is clear that the black nation today is in a state of profound flux the collective conscience of the people is being shaken to the very core of its being thereby causing black music and black culture to take off into so many different directions the pathos violence and disorder involved in this period of severe cultural and social disruption are often shocking to older generation negroes one oldtimer arna bontemps who had pleasant and memorable experiences in harlem during the negro renaissance of the twenties was shocked and frightened by the conditions he found on harlem streets in  as he puts it at least one reason for avoiding harlem night streets in  would have been the fear of muggers where poets went about singing in the days of the new awakening angry frustrated boys now prowled where primitive children had danced on the sidewalks hungry evileyed little criminals lurked in doorways    outlandish cults were meeting in some of the housefront churches where the moaning and shouting had formerly been spontaneous and filled with joy what in gods name had happened actually those conditions bontemps was observing in  were only the emerging conditions which produced the young generation of today the fright and shock is largely in his own mind because he is looking at a younger generation through the lens of the older generation the lawlessness which he observes is by and large no more than the breakdown of the cultural folkways and norms which he had known during his time although those norms may have provided some emotional and psychological security to his generation they cannot do so for the present generation because they do not apply to the social realities of today new folkways new mores are being developed but before they become structured the old ones must be vomited up this means a process of shock disruption and transformation it can be a violent and frightening process but it is not as destructive as bontemps puts it for there is a deeper more creative and constructive aspect to it for example one can note that with the destruction and breakdown of law that have occurred during the riots in black communities a deep sense of unity and brotherhood always asserts itself afterwards people who have been in a black community in the aftermath of rioting have witnessed how the residents become more polite to each other on the streets how they are not so quick to lose their temper with one another there is a steady growth in their sense of community and a profound realization that they are sharing a common cause and a common destiny the era of the new breed then is one of order in disorder clarity in confusion unity in disunity the forces of violence and destruction become superceded by those of liberation and brotherhood some have pointed out how negroes in throwing off the shackles of their slave mentality are responding to deep psychological needs for human dignity and selfrespect there is undoubtedly some truth to this but more should be added the changing attitudes among the younger generation are more than a psychological quest for human dignity they express also a greater will to power although many young blacks have come up in some of the worst kind of squalor and poverty in the country most of them still have not had to work as hard as their parents to make a living the young people today not only do not know what it is to labor all day in the fields under the hot sun they have no intention of doing so they are not willing to slave all day like their parents for only a few coins when they see white people all around them with easy jobs and a lot of money for these young people know how wealth success and prestige are really earned in white society the white man with whom they have had experiences is not the one who is openly evil but the one who is doublefaced who will smile in your face while he sticks a knife in your back in moving among the many social sets of the cities these ghetto blacks have come to find out that behind the rigid staid smile of the white woman is often no more than an insecure aggressive and sexually deprived girl that behind the overfriendly air of the white man is frequently a neurotic powerdriven adult with a childlike mentality negroes today know well the type of lives which white people really live and what they do behind the doors that is why unlike their parents they are not impressed by the examples set by white people their actual experiences have taught them that there is nothing genuine behind the examples and ideals of white society when a person has been turned out when he has experienced life as it really exists he just can not appreciate the artificial copy he reacts against phony sets and phony people this is the environmental situation of the new breed with his experiences under oppression and into the deeper and more subjective realms of life with his knowledge of the white world around him it becomes almost impossible for him to be moral in any conventional sense to have someone tell him to go to college so that he can get a good job to be patient and grateful until some charity organization gives him something is an insult if he wants something he will take it in whatever way he can and by any means necessary this is his will to power which goes beyond conventional morality the power attitude among the young breed is what makes them so violenceprone when the sun is hot when there is no place to go and nothing to do because you dont have the means it only takes a small incident of police brutality to set things off mass rioting and looting becomes an easy way to give vent to your pentup anger and frustrations and to get the things you want and need it is this threat of violence among the young breed which makes them a highly political group they are political not because they may like to go on demonstrations or engage in organized political activities but because certain of their actions have farreaching political consequences their willingness to use force and violence to get what they want upsets the traditional socioeconomic organization of american cities the white business and political leaders of the cities cannot stand for widespread looting and rioting because it means destruction of their properties and disturbing their political and social positions this they fear much more than they do peaceful demonstrations and thus become willing to make token concessions to the black community since the white power structure through its black spokesmen has lost its ability to control the black masses and keep them peaceful it has now recognized a necessity to do something quick good housing schools and jobsthese are the concrete essentials which the negro needs hence a host of shotgun crash programs the war on poverty neighborhood youth corps apprenticeship training programs neighborhood improvement centers etc yet it is becoming apparent that even these programs can not cope with the situation at hand one basic reason is that the private economy cant create enough jobs and decent houses for everyone but another more subtle reason has to do with the utilitarian nature of the solutions it is typical of white americans to reduce everything to matters of economic needs and basic commodities and to neglect thereby the related human factors after all when one deals with houses and jobs one inevitably must confront the people who are going to live in the houses and occupy the jobs so today when one talks about housing and jobs for negroes he sooner or later will have to face up to black people themselves which means facing up to attitudes of the younger generation and it is here at the attitudes and emotions of young blacks that the shotgun poverty programs are likely to fail for their wants are not easily satisfied if you offer a young black a job he might take it then again he might not he might not feel like working at the time he is too cool too resentful and too reckless to be easily satisfied he takes things in his own stride and is not prepared to shape up to the hasty and illprepared demands of the white man the attitudes dispositions and sounds of the new breed are with us no one can escape their influence the penetrating glares the pulsating rhythms the downtoearth heatthose elements which have always been a part of music and culturehave been reinvigorated and given a new distinct overall quality it is a quality which cannot be sufficiently described in words but whose end effect is unmistakably clear the end effect is one of completely unmasking the listener of piercing beneath artificial forms to the raw emotions and bare essentials the effect of new breed music is part and parcel of the total social situation created by the new breeders influence with the development of his style of life his actions and will to power everybodys front is broken and there is nowhere to hide the white ruling interest can no longer hide behind their promises and declarations of freedom democracy and racial equality no one believes their declarations any more now they stand fully exposed resting on nothing but naked power that power which was experienced so brutally by the black residents of watts and which operates so blatantly in vietnam and santo domingo the black socalled leadersthe preachers lawyers and entertainersno longer impress people with statements of what they can do and will do because everybody knows they cant back up what they say amid the masses of black people the field negroes stirred up by the younger generation have shed their slave mentality and stand face to face with their real plight in the country in the background one can hear the voices the shouts and cries of the new breed what is the new breed saying they are saying what the bible prophesied long ago we shall reap what our fathers have sown we are the last who shall be first the new breed has expressed a willingness to act they are hostile and restless ripe for militant black leadership can such leadership emerge this is the central question which the new breed poses to the black ghetto in america today 
the truth about negro crime
by frank poague jr
 the past few months as in the past  years we have v m been subjected to the alarming news of the negro crime i  i rate in america headlines in local and national newspapers  and magazines reports on radio and television have reminded awakened americans of this picture alabama to try  protesters  pickets arrested  protesters arrested  negroes arrested at greensboro  arrests end threeday protest in alabama town  killed in los angeles riot arrested these are just a few examples no intelligent person white or black can deny the fact that crime is more prevalent among negro americans in fact some white supremacists maintain that the negro is innately more prone to criminal acts according to a recent fbi report the states with the highest crime rates per  inhabitants were nevada  california  and arizona  vermont was lowest with five new yorks rate was  arrest statistics for  per cent of the population showed  negroes arrested for murder and  whites  negroes arrested for negligent homicide and  whites  negroes arrested for forcible rape and  whites  negroes arrested for robbery and  whites  negroes arrested for aggravated assault and  whites  negroes arrested for burglary and  whites  negroes arrested for larceny and  whites and  negroes arrested for auto theft and  whites these figures are alarming though only  per cent of the u s population is negro more than half per centof persons arrested for violent offenses murders robberies and aggravated assaults are negroes even while data on criminal law causality was being painstakingly assembled the current public dialogue over u s crime returned again to two harsh facts that spring out of the statistics  the high rate of negro crime and  the high rate of juvenile crime we have learned to accept the latter as a form of societal disorganization but the negro crime picture is too much to accept without severe criticisms in a real sense said a former high ranking administration official to speak of crime today is to speak of negro crime yet the evidence of negro crime today does no more than reaffirm a truism of law enforcement that crime however universal its incidence is peculiarly nurtured by ghettos that will in most instances grow into slums i might point out here that extra care must be taken in interpreting criminal statistics in regard to race note for instance  census and criminal statistics are based on the popular conception of race rather than on an anthropological differentiation  crime of negroes against whites are treated with more concern by local officials than crime of negroes against negroes  comparison of white and negro crime rate fail to take into account the differences between the population  the higher prison commitment rates of negroes reflect in part the inferior community facilities and specialized institutions for those negroes who personify problems not usually included with the scope of crime and  fbi statistics are weighted heavily by urban crime patterns of the north and west exaggerating incidence of negro crime to a degree one must not overlook those social conditions which make for the high crime rate among negro americans especially when crime is defined in terms of the application of the law we cant for instance overlook the fact that crimes committed by negroes are more frequently prosecuted than those committed by whites or that negroes are less well able to defend themselves legally they are less often in position to secure a good lawyer and they are more promptly sentenced to prison gunnar myrdal in his controversial american dilemma recognized long ago that at all times the stereotyped notion has prevailed that negroes have a criminal tendency which manifests itself in acts ranging all the way from petty thievery by household servants to razorslashing homicide statistics can be misleading roy wilkins executive secretary of the national association for the advancement of colored people recognized this when he said the records show the negro is more easily arrested than white persons dragnet arrests for a crime admitted by one or two persons frequently haul a dozen negroes to the jail and into the record books too often measurement of crime must be limited to those apprehendedundoubtedly not a representative sample of all criminals even the counting of apprehended criminals is crude and approximate at best because of the lack of uniformity in laws and in crimereporting over the united states furthermore any index of negro crime runs the risk of being inflated by discriminatory practices of the police the courts and penal systems to begin with the laws themselves may be discriminatory segregated legislation makes many acts a crime for negroes but not for whites for those reasons the indices which have to be used are best thought of as measures of apparent crime not crime per se according to a fbi report in  negroes were arrested twoandahalf to three times more frequently than other americans proportionate to their percentage of the population for crimes like murder and nonnegligent manslaughter aggravated assault and gambling negro arrest rates were roughly five to seven times those of whites in many instances the police frequently pick up numerous suspects in connection with a single crime this is especially true in communities where negroes lack political influence in fact the negro is more exposed to the misuse of police power than any other group the police custom of arresting negroes on slight suspicion or of staging mass roundups of negroes is definitely related to the negros lack of security and his inability to exert political pressure against such abuses the feeling is widespread among criminologists race relations experts negro leaders and others that the negro crime rate is exaggerated because of discriminatory arrest practices on the part of law enforcement agencies they agree that negroes are more liable both to be suspected ofand to be arrested forcertain crimes than are whites dragnet arrests and illegal arrests are more likely to occur when negroes rather than whites are involved they agree further that after arrest negroes are less likely to secure bail and are more liable to be counted in jail statistics they are more liable than whites to be indicted and less likely to have their cases dismissed if tried negroes are more likely to be convicted if convicted they are more likely to be included in the count of prisoners negroes are also more liable than whites to be kept in prison for the full terms of their commitments and correspondingly less likely to be paroled perhaps with more impartial treatment by all lawenforcement units negro crime might be considerably reduced but differential treatment by the police and courts is not the whole story by any means involved in these perplexities must be thrown education discrimination by a large segment of the dominant white group family disorganization induced by the competitive struggle to survive in a society with few equal opportunities lack of community organization employment practices and despair in attempting to accommodate to urban life the question should be why will crime continue to be more prevalent among negro americans a simple answer to this question could be that negro crime will remain more prevalent as long as there is prejudice and discrimination and no solutions to the problems the negro faces as a predominantly lowerclass citizen negroes when compared with other americans are more often lower class and poor slum residents of the largest cities victims of family disorganization southern in origin young and unemployed and objects of extensive discriminationeach an important social correlate of crime apart from race family disorganization family disorganization is characteristic of the negro family in fact thomas pettigrew in his recent book the profile of the negro american holds that there may be a direct personality relationship between violent crime and the absence of the father in any event there seems to be little question that broken families regardless of race are one of the agents of crime in general an example of the extent of family disorganization among negro families in the south may be seen in the following table 
selfimprovement w begins at home
by preston dewitt wiley sr
all me an uncle tom if it makes you feel better i happen to believe that nothing in  the glittering history of the negro revolution has failed so dismally as the zeitgeists failure in coming to grips with negro family deterioration the gap between the aims of the civil_rights movement and the welfare of the people is greater than ever if i were obliged to make a list of the most urgent problems facing the people of the united states in the field of social accommodation i would rank the disorganization of negro family life at the head of the list so much for perspective i have long preached albeit unsuccessfully that where there is no vision the people perish apparently current negro leadership cannot break the mode of its own doctrine to examine critically the generationsold habits of the northern negro and seek selfimprovement would be for them a return to the discredited uncle tom preachments of booker t washington it must be said sadly enough that the negro community has not always shown great enthusiasm for selfimprovement shrill cries by negro militants continue to drown out attempts by more responsible negro citizens to make a hardheaded appraisal of this most agonizing of americas social problems as a result the country is farther than ever from defining the boundaries of the problem one finds that today far too many negroes are bemused with the quaint view that somebody perhaps the federal government should do somethingshould seize the initiative and do it well and thoroughly that may be but by my lights the place to start is at the other end of townwithin the negro community let us be honest we negroes are not providing the answers and if we are not providing them because we do not have them then we need to ask whether we are doing enough to get them there is no question in my mind that beneath the surface there is disenchantment by many thousands of thoughtful negro americans who now sense the need to switch the civil_rights dialogue from the easily understandable aim of dismantling jim crow in the south to the comparably more difficult matter of the northern ghetto in this connection negro demagoguery notwithstanding it is plainly clear that negro riots in watts washington or new york acceleration of illegitimate birth emasculation of the negro male dominance of the negro female and the breakdown of negro family life which we have been talking about are all unarguable realities  negro leadership can perform an enormous service if it will act on the premise that negroes want to be both negroes and americans maintaining their racial integrity while associating on the freest terms with all american citizens participating in american culture in its broadest sense and contributing to it in fullest freedom in addressing the question of how to equip negroes to deal effectively with the changed aspect of the zeitgeist it would appear that a stress on self help and racial solidarity emphasis on economic development and criticism of thinly disguised negro racism together with a continued strong plea for political and social freedom should manifest itself in constructive form    meanwhile the process of education must go on while i have been accused since my piece conscience of a black conservative appeared in the january issue of negro digest of being more critical of negro progress than the facts justify  my conviction is that negroes are not anxious generally to provide initiative for social construction within the negro community my further view which is part of a larger complex of ideas is based upon the conviction that the acquisition of wealth and moralityattained largely by our own effortswill determine the future destiny of negroes in this great country of ours the conviction i spoke of a moment ago becomes manifest in my use of the word conservative what i mean here is that there are overwhelming values  american values if you willthat are being threatened by the excesses of the negro revolution the issues at stake are fundamental questions of moral and political philosophy being raised in american political culture to put the matter in perspective floyd mckessick of the congress of racial equality core recently insisted at a top administration conference on civil_rights that to alleviate the american negros plight the capitalistic system must be abolished whatever the pathology of the attraction one would like to see critical judgment brought to bear on this sort of thing surely it is the responsibility of negro leadership to assess the longrange consequences of its policies of denunciation would douglass or booker t washington really approve a politics of every snout at the public troughand longterm good sacrificed to the demands of the moment given a choice one suspects a majority of negroes will accommodate themselves to a growing emphasis on selfhelp as for the deterioration of the negro family the verdict is clear neither we nor any other people will ever be respected until we respect ourselves and we will never respect ourselves until we develop the inner strengths to live respectably this part of our destiny is in our own hands the laws which determine the destinies of individuals and nations are impartial and eternal we must deserve to be great 
break bias and poverty
by elinor richey
t sounds like an experiment primarily of interest to financiers actually the ones whose fates are riding on it are jobless negroes standing on street corners throughout the country the experiment is the u s economic development administrations new industry revitalization pilot project in oakland california early this year eda announced that because of dwindling industry and persistent high unemployment oakland had been designated a distressed area  as minedout appalachia was designated two years ago to get industry humming again and the jobless working massive doses of capital would be injected into oaklands economy in the form of grants and lowcost loans for public works for new and expanding enterprises both the city government and private industry scrambled to apply for upwards of  million to finance such public works as airport hangars and marine docks and industries ranging from an automotive assembly plant to a meteorological equipment concern a string is attached to these funds priority for jobs generated by edabacked enterprises  and such jobs are expected to run into thousands  must be given the longterm unemployed aid recipients must so pledge but what is significant is that the large majority of the jobless are negroes oaklands overall unemployment rate of  per cent is more than twice the national rate of  per cent but what shoots it up so high is that among the  per cent of the population who are negroes between  to  per cent are idle since the federal government has resolved to enforce the pledges and with thousands of jobs of the goodpaying kind expected to result it appears large numbers of oakland negroes will be ushered from poverty to pocketjingling plenty moreover federal spokesmen say that if the remedy works on oakland other cities with high jobless rates which nearly means extrahigh joblessness among negroeswill receive the eda cure oakland presents a strong test case like many other negroes who moved to industrial centers seeking better times only to meet road blocks from unions and personnel departments oakland negroes have never really been admitted to the urban economy although negroes comprise more than a third of the citys  population they hold but  per cent of the local apprenticeship jobs  per cent of the police force jobs and  per cent of the nonteaching jobs with the school district janitoring laboring and kitchen jobs excepted these statistics typify their position in the decentpaying job market and gauge the strength of the color barrier that eda has tackled recruitments for world war ii shipyard workers built oaklands negro community when the shipyards closed negroes were denied a place in the peacetime industrial boom yet negroes continued to arrive part of the national trek to california they were obliged to compete for the already dwindling supply of domestic and laboring jobs and there wasnt nearly enough work to go around throughout the forties and fifties oaklands economy appeared to be in rosy health while industries frequently departed oakland new westwardmigrating subsidiaries replaced them new employers followed the discrimination pattern filling their personnel needs by hiring in the suburbs and out of state after all oaklands civil service on the excuse of a dearth of qualified applicants did the same oakland appeared to be getting away with ignoring its negro citizens of course by preventing them from supporting themselves by default it elected to keep them on welfare although oakland is californias fourth city in size its welfare load soon was tracking los angeles faring little better were oaklands other minorities minorities make up roughly half of the city especially the mexicanamericans and relocated indians beneath the surface oakland was sick and by the sixties was showing it industry departures had increased and newcomers were bypassing oakland with the same complaint as the departees expensive labor and skills shortages together with high taxes and land prices of course the former came of deliberately keeping union help in short supply by barring minorities while high taxes resulted from keeping citizens too poor to pay taxes thus shifting the burden onto industry moreover business was fleeing shopping streets were becoming gloomy strands of closed and for sale signs domestic servants and welfare recipients arent big spenders and the citys commuting labor force cashed their paychecks in suburbia and spent them there a market survey showed  per cent of oaklands families had less than  a year in purchasing power shortsighted as always the city government saw only symptoms instead of recognizing its mistake in forcing citizens into dependency instead of making them productive consumers city fathers imagined all that was needed was to woo back the high spenders and big taxpayers it spruced up the city with new public buildings and modern street lights while angling for new industry via a nationwide advertising campaign none of this worked and now the federal government has in effect declared an emergency while oaklands malady has been diagnosed correctly this time it doesnt mean a cure will be easy nobody expects oakland to passively surrender its prejudices moreover not only has unemployment multiplied numerically over the past two decades but jobs have grown more demanding if the government is to require that employers hire the jobless there must be qualified applicants waiting on the bench to qualify for the jobs many of the jobless will need training to provide it the government has set up a  million skills center which like those already operating in detroit and chicago will combine reading and writing with vocational training courses will range from six months to two years with enrollees receiving living allowances of from  to  while they train but many jobs also require a union card oakland labor unions have maintained the fiction that they dont discriminate its just that some cant pass their apprenticeship tests negroes and mexicanamericans have charged that union screening is designed to shut them out not the least of the skills centers functions will be to prepare applicants to pass apprenticeship screening eda men have been holding conferences with oakland labor officials asking their cooperation in the skills center and jobcreating project but while inviting volunteer compliance federal spokesmen have warned that if a hiring agent whether an employer or a labor official seeks to violate or circumvent the requirement that edagenerated jobs go to the jobless effective persuasion will be brought to bear eda agents are readying an arsenal of effective persuaders among them is the new equal employment opportunities commission which has the responsibility of enforcing the provisions of the  civil_rights act that bars racial discrimination in jobs the commission headed by franklin d roosevelt jr is empowered to obtain court injunctions ordering employers or unions to desist from discriminatory practices should an edabacked work project fail to hire a qualified minority person the commission can file an injunction against the employer or if a union were the hiring agent the union would be the injunction target the commission might also act against a union which unjustly turned down a skills center graduate for an apprenticeship program roosevelt visited oakland in march to instruct minority leaders and others how to file complaints with his agency which may act only when a specific complaint has been made the department of labor is in a position to crack down with economic sanctions it can cancel federal contracts with firms that practice job discrimination but eda is exploring other ways of enforcing the job pledges not the least of which is synchronizing the flow of subsidy with an employers cooperation with edas goals assisting eda in plotting strategy for employing the enforcement arsenal is dr floyd hunter the eminent negro sociologist and author his crack berkeleybased research firm has been tapped by eda to conduct planning research and evaluation for the oakland job creating project dr hunter who has called oaklands city government a coordinating effort for the business community and who once conducted a housing discrimination study for the city that was so accusatory of his employers that they suppressed it will keep an eagle eye on edabacked enterprises to make sure their hiring practices measure up as added insurance oakland civil_rights organizations are planning persuaders of their own leaders such as naacp president clinton white and mark comfort of the oakland direct action committee plan to maintain a continuing watch over hiring if an employer violates his pledge he may find his operation paralyzed by a mass demonstration far from being unique the plight of oaklands negroes is merely part of a general dismal western situation a report on negro workers in  western states recently issued by the bureau of labor statistics showed only seven in  had professional technical or managerial jobs as contrasted to the white rate of  per  more than  per cent of western negro workers have lowpaying unskilled or semiskilled jobs compared with  per cent of the white workers demonstrating that it is nearly as easy for a negro to become a doctor as to enter a union were statistics showing the entire west had  negro plumbers and  negro doctors no doubt the watts riots goaded this long overdue federal crackdown on job discrimination but it was also spurred by reports of two of president johnsons advisory groups his commission on automation warned that the present ratio of two jobless negroes to one jobless white will rise to five to one by  if negroes continue to hold the same proportion of jobs in each general occupational category as they do now and the presidents council of economic advisers have computed the cost to the nation of racial discrimination in employment their figures say that if negroes were assimilated into the work force labor productivity would rise  billion oaklands error is the nations error in microcosm 
in the work of negro writers
by horace r cayton
are all imprisoned within our culture it is almost impossible to break through the customary ways of perceiving the world about us in order that we may question in a fundamental sense the values held by society sometimes a new critical perspective of society and its culture is stimulated by powerful ideological developments which throw new light on the everyday world of events a new perspective can lead to insight and change these revelations come to philosophers scientists political leaders and above all to the artist and of all the artists it has  been the writer who from the beginning of time has fashioned various brave new worlds the creative process of the writer is difficult to describe and understand it may be said that all men dream of freedom but it requires the powerful revelation and perception of the artist to capture these dreams and put them into shape we must understand the influences of various ideological forces as they have touched the perceptions and insights of negro writers if we are to understand the prophets and poets of the new negro in contemporary american society among the most crucial and fundamental forces affecting the negro writer have been those of psychoanalysis and the several disciplines of the social sciences i am a sociologist by training and a writer by temperament many sociologists consider me one of them and i usually tell them i am a writer when writers think of me as a writer i tell them im probably more of a sociologist and this leads me into a fundamental concern the question of identity i shall start with an autobiographical statement perhaps because i have recently completed an autobiography i was born in seattle at the turn of the century i discovered at a very early age perhaps three or four that i was a negro and i became aware that i would always be one and that negroes would always be underprivileged and stigmatized a group of people set apart i also knew that i was an american and in school as well as in the home i learned that america had a dream of freedom these two identities both of which i had internalized seemed to be in constant conflict when i became aware of the conflict i was confused allen wheelis in his book the quest for identity writes nowadays the sense of self is deficient the questions of adolescence who am i where am i going what is the meaning of life receive no final answers nor can they be laid aside the uncertainty persists the period of being uncommitted is longer the choices with which it terminates more tentative personal identity does not become fixed does not therefore provide an unchanging vantage point from which to view experience man is still the measure of all things but it is no longer the inner man that measures it is the other man specifically it is the plurality of men the group and what the group provides is shifting patterns what it measures is conformity it does not provide the hard inner core by which the value of patterns and conformity is determined the hard inner core has in our time become diffuse elusive often fluid more than ever before one is aware of the identity he appears to have and more than ever before is dissatisfied with it it doesnt fit it seems alien as though the unique course of ones life had been determined by untoward accident commitments of all kinds social vocational marital moral are made more tentatively longterm goals seem to become progressively less feasible wheelis continues to observe that identity is a coherent sense of self it depends upon the awareness that ones endeavors and ones life make sense that they are meaningful in the context in which life is lived it depends also upon stable values and upon the conviction that ones actions and values are harmoniously related it is a sense of wholeness of integration of knowing what is right and what is wrong and of being able to choose    the past half century has encompassed enormous gains in understanding and in mastery but many of the old fixed points of reference have been lost and have not been replaced the insecurity i felt as a childtorn between what i had been taught and what washas now spread to all society while i found to an extent an identity other negroes and the whole american society remain confronted by this question richard wright and ralph ellison were fascinated with what herbert hill describes as that vast senseless social order which destroys its victim and which poses the necessity to remain sane in a society where the individual personality is denied and the world appears devoid of meaning hill goes on to say that essentially the framework for native son one of the important novels in contemporary american literature is to be found in its implicit assumption that the social order is directly responsible for the degradation of the negro that american society produces conditions which distort and destroy individual human beings who are part of an oppressed group the character in the book who functions as wrights spokesman states taken collectively they are not simply twelve million people in reality they constitute a separate nation shunned and stripped and held captive within this nation devoid of political social economic and property rights  the loss of identity ultimately leads the individual to a state of alienation both from himself and from the society at large he is then constantly preoccupied with the seeking of the self and this is where his time and energy are spent several negro intellectuals have protested against this thus saunders redding has written the obligations imposed by race upon the average educators and talented negro    are vast and become at last onerous i am tired of giving up my creative initiative to these demands before considering the psychological effects of american culture on both the blacks and the whites i shall touch briefly upon the historical aspect of the negro it is unique in terms of world history i subscribe to the school of thought that little very little of african culture was brought to the united states and that that which the negro did retain was isolated and died a rapid death what i am saying is that the socalled american negro subculture is purely a product of the negros experience in america it is the american culture refracted through the prism of  years of subordination e franklin frazier in his last book the negro church describes the slow growth of cohesiveness in the negro community the cruelty of the plantation system did not even permit the development of a stable family group it was the negro church that first brought some cohesion to the negro it was many years before negroes as a group could even envision a free world certainly there were slave revolts and insurrections but it was not until the negro as a group began to have revelations similar to the one i experienced upon learning that at port arthur in  the japanese a colored race had defeated the russians predominantly a caucasian nation that the negro began to search for his identity for a definition recognition and purpose the only way to analyze the position of the negro in america is to anaylze the culture in its entirety america has failed to develop a meaningful way of life that could make our country great a way of fulfilling the vast areas of our individual personalities that are unused and truncated this is evidenced by the indescribable loneliness that pervades our existence we have embraced and are the victims of a configuration of shoddy values the getrichquick compulsion and our surrender to the bitch goddess of material success our emphasis is on sex for gratification rather than deep organic emotional expression experience and communication we are unable to formulate a meaningful religion in spite of frenetic churchgoing and unable to rid ourselves of an archaic economic system that defies all laws of logic humanity and downright common sense and this in the most bountiful country in the world a country birthed in principles both noble and bold familiarized to us all as the american dream american culture places high value on appearances and beautyby all means one must be beautiful must conform to the stereotyped norms of socalled anglosaxon beauty and appearance along with this anglosaxon appearance comes the puritan ideology engulfing one in attitudes such as cleanliness is next to godliness but the next step in this train of thought as it applies to the negro is quite obvious he is made to feel dirty and consequently evil from the point of appearance alone the negro is not in step with the established and accepted norms and perhaps it is at just this point that a negro first begins to develop his sense of shame over his very blackness the black boy or girl learns much more early than we realize that there is something wrong with him that he isnt just an ordinary person that he has a stigma which he must live with for the rest of his life this sets up great waves of shame that engulf the entire personality the whole physical and psychological being the reason for the allpervasiveness of the feeling of shame is that shame has no specific focal point for cause shame is the result of a vague overall rejection the reasons for the rejection are irrational and without structure shame all too frequently has unknown roots i knew that shame was something i had to fight and for a group of people who have lived for hundreds of years as a shamed people it almost takes a conversion in the form of a religious experience to overcome that sense of shame accompanying the feeling of shame is a reaction pattern a theory which i developed in a sort of interaction between richard wright and myself it is what i have called the fearhatefear syndrome let me begin with a certain negro girl the only one that dared to enter an allwhite school walking the gauntlet of her fellow students who formed a double line and spat in her face as she passed that picture was on the front page of the new york times and but a few hours later was reproduced not only in pravda and izvestia but in paris london the scandinavian countries and in all of the nonwhite countries of the world including those we try to buy with socalled foreign aid as a writer i try to imagine what went on in this cruel drama what did the negro girl do when she got home what gave her such dignity and poise and what of the little white girls who had performed this ritual of spitting surely we have fouled our nest we have corrupted our children do you wonder then that there are black muslims in the united states who have found relief from this situation by openly hating all white people let me confess although i am for human dignity and would fight for whites if they were abused humiliated and spat upon there is a residue of hate in my heart as i think there is in most negroes living in the united states to explain this i developed a theory several years ago i wrote a  speech in which i tried to state in technical terms what i believed to be the psychology of many negroes at that time although it is perhaps currently changing i quote i am convinced that at the core of the negros mentality there is a fearhatefear complex my assumption is that all men in western european civilization have unconscious guilt and fear of punishment for this guilt in the case of the dominant group this guilt is to a large extent irrational it can be shown to be false a figment of the imagination a holdover from early childhood experiences guilt can more easily be resolved by psychiatric treatment or even by rational cogitation but in the negro the psychological problem is ever intensified for him punishment in the actual environment is ever present violence psychological and physical leaps at him from every side the personality is brutalized by an unfriendly environment this reinforces and intensifies the normal insecurity he feels as a person living in our highly complex society such attacks on his personality lead to resentment and hatred of the white man however the certain knowledge that he will be punished if his hate emotions are discovered only compound this fear this is the negro reaction to his own brutalization subordination and hurt it is this vicious cycle in which the american negro is caught and in which his personality is pulverized by an evermounting selfpropelling rocket of emotional conflict the negro has been hurt he knows it he wants to strike back but he must notthere is evidence everywhere that to do so would lead to his destruction each of us is well aware of the brutalities that happened only yesterday i shall speak autobiographically to make my point more vivid my father was born a slave when i think of it now it is unbelievable that the body of my father could have been bought and sold like an ox or a horse i remember hearing in my childhoodi was tenof a negro who was lynched his genitals were cut off his living body then he was chained to a tree and burned alive they tied his carcass to a car and dragged it down the main street of the town do you doubt that that left a scar on my soul that some vestige of hate and fear remains although i have gone through psychoanalysis and am emotionally committed to the democratic ideal i learned that my problem as a person was no different from that of the japanese or the mexican i learned that it was the basic problem of adjustment to rejection and fear subordination whatever the cause produces the same result when that subjection is based on force and violence the inevitable product in the human personality must be fear and hate how has the negro dealt with his feelings of shame there are several paths open to the negro perhaps the one most in evidence today is the mass rejection of shame as the members of the mass strengthen each other by real or symbolic acts  there is another path it is the redefinition of the past by discovering a more glorious past as it was imagined to have been in africa and of course there have been various negro nationalist movements from time to time i first saw this phenomenon when marcus garvey came to seattle to lead a nationalist parade garvey organized a million black americans and although his goals were foolish the pride he stirred in black hearts was very real i was just a young man then for it was back in the late twenties there had been a parade down second avenue the main street of seattle and thousands had followed their leader their messiah who was to lead them back to africa and to freedomthe honorable marcus aurelius garvey dcl founder of the black universal negro improvement association a selfeducated eloquent and fanatically zealous jamaican in the parade were negro women in the uniform of black cross nurses and others who wore wrapped puttees of the african motorcycle corps and in front the royal african legions rode on horses it was ludicrous and laughable but the black washerwomen were deadly serious and the black men laborers and servants had a pride that raised the demonstration out of the absurd and struck fear or admiration in the watchers on the dark faces for the first time there was pride and joy and fulfillment reflecting limpid faith in the completeness of living which they had found later on at a meeting at the star theatre i heard garvey deliver in deep resonant tones their slogan one god one aim one destiny for the garveyites he was a savior a messiah who promised to snatch them from the edge of the abyss and turn their grief into greatness he had put steel in the spines of negroes who had previously been ashamed of their color i tried to tell my parents about it later but when i described fat black washerwomen in tight motorcycle pants they laughed and i quickly stopped them saying dont laugh they were proud this is the first time i have ever seen negroes walking down the streets of a white city with pride and dignity the garvey movement was the only real mass movement among american negroes and it was based on glorifying things black the garveyites were going to have black cross nurses rather than white cross or red cross nurses a black house rather than a white house a black star steamship line rather than a white star line it was ludicrous certainly but it fulfilled a deep hunger in the hearts of more than a million american negroes a valid hunger a hunger that still exists in the  or  years since garvey that hunger has deepened been made more acute if america does not allow the negro to find pride in himself as an american then he will inevitably seek acceptance as a black man as for the black muslims their goals are just as foolish as garveys but they are appealing to the same hunger in that sense they are on valid ground i will not join them although i have been tempted i still hope for forgive me if i seem naivethe fulfillment of the american dream for all people no matter what color i havent given that up yet james baldwin writes to his nephew in my dungeon shook  please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but their inhumanity and fear    there is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept them with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it our failure to achieve a mature culture in which negroes and whites alike can accomplish some aspect of personality integration has within it the seeds of political fascism and if the emotionally truncated lives of negroes lead many of them to give up a fruitless struggle and submit to the certainty of a harsh dictator many whites in their immature longing for a meaning to their lives and for a security they have not been able to find act in a manner that would indicate they too are longing for the strong though cruel father who will dictate the functions of their lives there is another ideology that has profoundly affected the american negro the communist movement in the united states seized upon the scottsboro case and the crisis of the depression as a golden opportunity to seek recruits among negroes according to rayford logan soon after world war i the communists sought to win the support of negro workers in the north however the communists sixth world congress made a fatal mistake when in  it resolved to work toward the formation of a separate black nation within the united states an overwhelming majority of negroes had no more desire to settle in a separate nation than they had to go back to africa but the communists sensing the propaganda value of the scottsboro trials stole the scottsboro case from the naacp and made violent attacks on w e b du bois who as editor of the crisis brilliantly exposed the fraudulent program of the communist party since most negroes knew of the work of men like du bois and had never heard of marx or lenin and also since they were fundamentally loyal americans despite their secondclass citizenship this communist maneuver won little confidence among negroes even in  after five years of the depression and before the new deal had begun to reach down to negroes i estimate that less than  negroes were members of the american communist party out of a total of  party members the frequent shifting of the communist party position on the negro question after  repeated the failures of the previous years and prevented the communists from building a permanent base within the negro community as professor wilson record has aptly said in his authoritative study american negroes refused to succumb to a siren song sung in bass quite apart from the failure of the communists to organize negroes they did provide a tremendous stimulant to the thinking and writing of negroes first the russian revolution itself startled the civilized world then when the communists started working with american negroes they offered them the hope that if black and white would unite there would be a free world this stimulated negroes to a further reconsideration of the possibility of a more meaningful existence but few negroes were aware of the depth of their distrust toward the whites besides the communist party in america used incredibly poor tactics the fundamental fact was that the negroes simply did not trust the white working class and its discriminatory labor unions and they did not trust them for good reason for the white working class had traditionally been the negroes enemy and in this there has been no fundamental change    but the issue for some was more complicated thus richard wright for example a mississippi boy caught some vision of a different world as the result of the marxist influence he envisioned a world in which he could walk with dignity and he was for an important period of his life seduced by the communist vision which in a sense defeated the great potential that was his for his eventual disenchantment with the communists caused him to devote much of his later life and energy fighting them because they had tricked and lied to him that same energy might have gone into brilliant literary work yet one cannot ignore the fact that the communist party with all its failures still had immense influence on wright as a writer in his blueprint for negro writing published in the new challenge wright said  in the lives of negro writers must be found those materials and experiences which will create a meaningful picture of the world today many young writers have grown to believe that a marxist analysis of society presents such a picture it creates a picture which when placed before the eyes of the writer should unify his personality organize his emotions buttress him with a tense and obdurate will to change the world and in turn this changed world will dialectically change the writer hence it is through a marxist conception of reality and society that the maximum degree of freedom in thought and feeling can be gained for the negro writer further this dramatic marxist vision when consciously grasped endows the writer with a sense of dignity which no other vision can give ultimately it restores to the writer his lost heritage that is his role as a creator of the world in which he lives and as a creator of himself i am inextricably concerned with the problems of the negro and with the possibility of enriching the american culture so i must act in some fashion for a tremendous racial confrontation is taking place confrontation is on old and honorable word which has recently come into current usage it means a direct facetoface meeting of people or peoples with conflicting interests ideas or values which must be resolved a confrontation may be resolved by a synthesis of these conflicting ideologies or beliefs or it may result in avoidance isolation or violence a confrontation is always a tense meaningful and fateful phenomenon me the snares of death confronted me is the text of psalms  how much time have we to convince the americans and the world that democracy does not mean white domination not much i believe that the negro must get himself into positions of power we need laws and the continuation of picket lines and demonstrations to awaken our people and the whole of american society id like to quote richard wrights introductory essay to dr st clair drakes and my book black metropolis will the negro in the language of andre malraux find meaning in his humiliation make his slums and his sweatshops his modern cathedrals out of which will be born a new consciousness that can guide him toward freedom or will he continue as he does today saying joblike to the society that crushes him though it slays me yet will i trust in it this for richard wright was a rhetorical question long before many he had sensed the dictates of history if james baldwin is the poet of the negro revolt richard wright was its prophet in  wright wrote the text of a picture book entitled  million black voices which was both poetic and prophetic in it he stated we black folk our history and our present being are a mirror of all the manifold experiences in america what we want what we represent what we endure is what america is if we black folk perish america will perish if america has forgotten her past then i let her look into the mirror of our consciousness and she will see the living past living in the present for our memories go back through our black folk of today through the recollections of our black parents and through the tales of slavery told by our black grandparents to the time when none of us black or white lived in this fertile land the differences between black folk and white folk are not blood or color and the ties that bind us are deeper than those that separate us the common road of hope which we all have travelled has brought us into a stronger kinship than any words laws or legal claims look at us and know us and you will know yourselves for we are you looking back at you from the dark mirror of our lives what do we black folk want we want what others have the right to share in the upward march of american life the only life we remember or have ever known the lords of the land say we will not grant this we answer we ask you to grant us nothing we are winning our heritage though our toll in suffering is great the bosses of the building say your problem is beyond solution we answer our problem is being solved we are crossing the line you dared us to cross though we pay in the coin of death the seasons of the plantation no longer dictate the lives of many of us hundreds of thousands of us are moving into the sphere of conscious history we are with the new tide we stand at the crossroads we watch each new procession the hot wires carry urgent appeals print compels us voices are speaking men are moving and we shall be with them

toward the pantry sometimes she hated having to take things mrs nelson gave her ever since shed given wicker that old blanket to keep him warmer when he had the flu she thought she owned him she always said she was taking care of him hoping he didnt turn out like his father mrs nelson continued to talk as she walked to the other side of the kitchen i told his aunt he was going to be no good she said leaning inside the refrigerator spending all that time fooling around with papas old car youd think if he wanted to be a mechanic hed stay around here and learn the trade he could still be working at the esso station but no he decides to change jobs you know she turned toward libby i still wonder why he didnt marry that little thompson girl they were two of a kind mrs nelson looked distastefully at her fingers that were sticky from the biscuit dough hurry up she said wiping her hand on a towel mr nelson has to leave early libby ignored her mrs nelson was always saying mean things about hal and libby had the hardest time holding her temper every time libby thought about the woman pumping her friend sally about things that did not concern her she got plain angry just because sally worked for mrs henderson mrs nelson thought she could poke her nose into libbys business libby didnt understand why mrs nelson didnt come right out and ask if she were married she could understand how the woman might be curious about where hal was living but that gave her no reason for spreading lies going around making people think all libbys five children were bastards god you cant trust none of them she said poking extra hard inside the pickle jar with the spatula according to sally mrs nelson had asked about the identity of the father of libbys baby she hinted sally said that libby bought herself a wedding band instead of hal giving her the ring libby took the biscuits out of the oven and began buttering the insides the funny thing was she honestly thought mrs nelson had believed her when she said her husband was up north working she hadnt lied really the last postcard she had from hal said he was working in a canning factory upstate she saw no reason to say that card had been written almost a year ago during her working hours she tried to avoid thinking about her husband calvin had been nothing but a baby when he left at first she figured he only had left them for the summer lots of fellows she knew up and took off for a couple of months but they usually came back in the fall not hal he didnt ever do anything according to a set pattern one day he was working in the drug store and coming home and loving her at night and the next thing she knew he was off and gone again some people just have a wandering bug in them she looked around her at the sunlit kitchen comparing it to the narrow kitchen in her own home sometimes meetrie didnt believe her when she told the children about the food the nelsons had for breakfast talking about bacon and waffles made meetries eyes shine for real she would ask pulling her top pigtail for real and sometimes when she was pouring those cornflakes into the four cups and stretching the powdered milk with more water than the welfare lady ever intended she didnt believe herself this morning when she had tied a dish towel around wickers neck and sat down to spoon feed him his corn flakes meetrie made a regular nuisance of herself waiting for his leftover cereal asking every five seconds if he had finished eating every day this week she had come walking into mrs nelsons house exactly on time and every day mrs nelson came into the kitchen to see if she possibly could come a little earlier she put the eggs into the coddies and picked up the butter to carry to the table she had left her own house in a mess as usual yesterday was so rainy the doors stayed shut all day and the odor of urine from the childrens room invaded the whole house but she was not at home now she was working in another house nudging the swinging door with her elbow she pushed her way into the dining room as libby washed the breakfast dishes the kitchen seemed to become uncomfortably hot mrs nelson cleared the table and brought the last dishes to the sink did you take wicker back to the doctor she took the cups from mrs nelson when i took him the first time the doctor said it was hay fever and hed probably outgrow it it seemed to libby that if mrs nelson were so concerned about wicker she would suggest bringing all the children to play in her backyard during the day that way libby could keep an eye on them herself libby let the dishwater drain and rinsed her hands and face in cold water to cool off if mrs dickens didnt soon move calvin from the laundry basket on her porch the sun would be shining right into his face every morning when she put him and the clean diapers into the basket she found herself wishing her mother were well enough to look after the baby although with that last sickness coming back off and on she didnt feel right saddling her mother with her own problems  she had asked mrs dickens if she could leave calvin inside the house but according to mrs dickens sixthirty was too early to be fooling with a baby besides shed said everybody around heres got too many babies to have to steal one off my front porch in the middle of the day right when libby was glazing the ham mrs nelson insisted on having a hot lunch what upset her most about the woman was the way she could come up with more work when libby was busiest mrs nelson was good for thinking up foolishness especially if it meant working overtime usually libby didnt mind staying late without notice except once she stopped puncturing the ham with cloves to count back it must have been two christmases ago and she wished she had that three dollars now she saved for months to buy hal a new fishing rod and had managed to put one in layaway then on the last day that she could make a payment before the store put the rod back into stock mrs nelson made her stay late to help with the church baking sale all the while she was icing those simple santa claus faces she was watching the clock hands pass the stores closing hours then when she was ready to go home mrs nelson gave her a small bag full of broken pieces and cookies that were too brown to sell she put the ham into the oven and opened a can of tomato soup for mrs nelsons lunch at home about now meetrie was scavenging around the neighbors fruit trees for apples since libby never knew what fruit would be there for the picking she always left out cold boiled potatoes for the children to eat sometimes there was enough food to make a sandwich for them to share during the afternoon when mrs nelson was safely away taking minutes of the bridge club meeting in the living room libby pulled out a bundle of roughdried clothes from a shelf in the pantry once a week usually when mrs nelson was spending the morning away from home she did her wash and some of her mothers clothes in the electric machine hers was such a paltry weekly wash she smoothed the iron over a long piece of embroidered ribbon meetries favorite possession here and there the colored threads were becoming unwoven but meetrie would rather wear that ribbon than anything in the world hal brought it home for her to wear to sunday school and there had been enough left over to make a bracelet for meetries slender arm now the folded ribbon that she tucked into a blouse pocket looked as if it might disintegrate into shreds at five oclock libby folded up the ironing board tucked the clothes behind the cake boxes on the bottom shelf and began counting out plates for the cold buffet she was soaping a heavy mixing bowl in which shed made potato salad when she heard a noise in the backyard noises that time of evening never disturbed her she imagined one of the neighborhood dogs was loose although mrs nelson swore up and down she would get rid of the next animal that dug up her chrysanthemum bed she had begun rinsing the silver when she thought she heard footsteps approaching the house for no reason at all she felt chilled but then the footsteps stopped and she knew she was being silly this time of year she had seen lots of people wandering through the neighborhood looking for odd jobs or something to eat besides the kitchen had become too steamy and warm to do anything but settle into the quiet routine of cleaning when mrs nelson came through the swinging door carrying the last of the dessert plates she involuntarily jumped why libby what on earth is wrong with you you jumped like a scared rabbit cat nothing maam i guess im tired from this heat with the inside of her arm she wiped the perspiration from her forehead that husband of yours should get himself home mrs nelson said intently watching her face and sliding the dishes into the sink goodness girl she popped her fingers again into the dishwater this water is ice cold then as if she had not interrupted herself she turned toward libby with him home you wouldnt have to do both your work and his libby nodded her head the way she always did mumbled something that sounded like yes maam and busied herself arranging the kitchen curtains until she was certain mrs nelson had left the room she stored the silver in the chest put away the company china and went to see if mrs nelson had anything else for her to do the door to the downstairs bedroom was closed and since mr nelson usually ate thursday dinner in town she was finished for the day she returned to the kitchen and picked up two waxed paper packages she had stuck behind the serving bowls in the cabinet she dropped them into a paper bag and cautiously opened the refrigerator door she counted the leftover salads decided against taking any and saw how much sliced ham was left after slipping four large slices into her bag she checked the front and side doors to make sure mrs nelson was shut in and left by the back door    outside she hardly could tell that the season had changed from summer to fall the air was still and humid hanging over the trees preventing the green leaves from changing to red and yellow the sleeveless blouse she wore felt surprisingly light after the heavy starched uniform she had worn all day as she walked across the green lawn and toward the tool shed that bordered the summer vegetable garden she could hear the quiet humming of the crickets libby saw that the door was open which was strange the nelsons had never locked the shed but kept the door closed to keep out the dogs she was on her way to shut the door when she saw him standing by the wooden building hal her lips silently formed the word still she was not certain and her feet kept moving toward the wooden shed hal she called softly her voice was inaudible she was almost upon him now and from the way he reached into his pocket for a match she could tell he had been watching her all along she wondered for a minute what she would say she had imagined him coming home but not at a crazy time like this yet she felt strangely sure of herself certain that she was in no danger of making a fool of herself by crying she kept walking toward him and even this far away she could see the high cheekbones that marked all of their children as belonging to him hello libby he said blocking the path in front of her and reaching for her she knew he was kissing her and she was standing still kissing him back but the whole moment seemed so unreal all the while he held her she was wondering how he thought he could just come back as if hed never left her before finally she pulled away and his arms dropped to his side she watched his hands slip into his pants pocket i didnt think you were never coming back she said still facing him and smelling the cheap aftershave lotion he always used since before he started shaving where you been she looked past him at the hedge on the side of the yard wondering why she should notice how he smelled after that last card i didnt have no way of knowing which way you were heading and here you are coming back like theres not no reason for me to say i dont want you back the words came out in a rush matching the tears that were falling on her cheeks hal stood quietly with the same solid unconcerned expression that always made her angry when she was upset his arm reached out to her but she pushed him away who do you think you are anyway she demanded swallowing the sobs who do you think you are going away for as long as you please she was shouting now and to her ears her voice seemed apart from the rest of her suddenly she was pummeling his shoulders with her fists and before she realized what she had done she felt the side of her cheek smarting from the pressure of his hand oh she whispered staring at him calm yourself down girl his voice was gruff you give me a chance to explain you hear he took hold of her hand as if to keep her from striking him ive been working girl i needed to get away you think id write you those cards if i wasnt planning on coming back she stared at him her eyes following the green diagonal pattern in his shirt on down to the cotton twill pants that were so new they still had a crease down the front i just had to get away for a while seems like those children were making me crazy always running around not ever being still now dont you go saying i dont love you or those kids he stopped talking and looked straight at her if i didnt i wouldnt be coming back here the least you could have done was to tell me where you were her voice began to falter wicker and hamlet dont even ask about you no more they aint seen you in so long they forgot about you she was talking so fast her words seemed to pile up on each other people in town were all the time asking when you were coming back and i didnt have anything to tell them hal stood quietly listening to her he didnt even say anything when she stopped to catch her breath i got me a job we were getting along without you suddenly she couldnt say anything else there wasnt any sense in lying lots of times she wished hal was at home to help her decide things about the children this morning like every other morning for the past month she had to drag wicker from under the kitchen table he was all the time crawling under something yelling his head off and she didnt know what to do about him howd you know where i was i asked around he answered one of the boys in the drugstore said he thought you worked full time out here she swallowed quickly thinking that he couldnt even let her be the first person to know he was home well i had to find you he said as if understanding her thoughts i stopped by the house but meetrie wouldnt talk to me and wouldnt let the others even get close took the candy i brought them though dont you ever get them anything sweet to eat reckon they knew who you were she waited for him to understand the meaning of her words what you doing buying candy anyway they cant wear candy on their feet hal ignored her i got them some other things outside they didnt seem to have too many toys to play with howd you get out here he looked too freshly pressed to have walked from town on the dusty road i got me a car he said pointing across a field parked it over there near the path he was grinning like he expected her to be pleased a car her voice was dull a car libby stood unbelieving  they wouldnt have any use for it except to go to town weekends they didnt have money to be buying gas besides all their friends and even the church were right in their neighborhood its not a new one but its all paid for i got it to get me home i even made enough money to get brand new seat covers hal said proudly bet you thought we wouldnt never have a car she nodded her head dully heh honey remember before we were married we talked about getting one of those little fords you know with the two seats in front one like we were going to get to drive up north his voice sounded wistful and he waited to see if she remembered seeing no bit of recognition in her eyes he kept talking i could have gotten me one of those dirt cheap but at the last minute i sort of changed my mind she stood as if in a spell listening to his voice and wondering how he could be so excited over a car he didnt even act like he had just slapped her come on he grabbed her hand lets go look i got it painted blue just like you always wanted libby felt tears washing her eyes blue was her favorite color yet she couldnt for the life of her understand him here they were needing to get the house fixed up so the chimney didnt smoke when the cold came she still hadnt paid the doctor his money from the last time calvin was in the hospital and he decided to bring home a car she turned toward him now that youre here you going to sell it he looked in the direction where the car was parked and again at her no he said not meeting her eyes im going to keep it bet meetrie would like riding in a car and the little fellows too suddenly he smiled its got brand new pipes the man up north put them on special for me libby you should hear this baby when i take off he kept on talking about the car forcing her to listen she couldnt even understand why he was so excited about exhaust pipes where they lived there werent that many other people who could listen out for hals car she remained quiet as he finished smoking and dropped the cigarette butt on the ground crushing the tiny red light with the heel of his shoe he still held her by the hand almost pulling her along as they began walking across the field what you going to do for a job she asked hurrying to keep up with him she always forgot how tall he was until she had to try and walk beside him he had a certain rhythm to his walk and she listened to their footsteps hitting the brittle grass still too fast for you he smiled down at her matching his long strides with her fast short steps oh ill get my old job back he said his brown eyes were smiling webberll be glad to get me back after fooling with those slow niggers libby knew he was right every time she went to the drugstore mr webber made a special point of asking when she was expecting hal home hal was talking but not particularly to her havent seen this old town in so long just about forgotten what everything looks like his eyes came to rest on the brown bag she still clutched in her hand whats that leftovers for the children she answered i dont like for them to go to bed without anything in their stomachs mrs nelson give it to you no i guess she knows i take whats left wherere you planning to get money to buy gas the esso man wont give you no credit unless you been working steady around here he ignored her his voice insistent she know you took this food mrs nelson never gives away anything unless its spoiled he did not say another word until they reached the car and she was too tired to talk her whole body felt drained she only wanted to see the car up close touch it and see it at the same time to end the moment she was dreading and hope she didnt start crying as she stood looking at the old ford she felt her tongue almost stick to her throat she walked to the front of the car and the headlights seemed to make a face at her in the dusky twilight she could see the fresh paint and the chromium parts were shining even seeing it parked there just a few steps away she still could not believe he had brought home a car when they needed everything else then hal was standing quietly beside her his arms around her shoulder pressing her close to him get in he said opening the door he pressed the button to lock her in and strode around to the drivers side she watched while he pushed in the key seeing past the dusty tint of the front windows past the flat countryside she looked out at the windowdarkened cotton fields and at the scrawny trees in the distance the trees were stuck to the edge of the fields as if the men who cleared the ground had been too lazy to finish their work she looked at the road she had walked this morning seeing how it seemed to blend into the sameness of the surrounding land the starting motor interrupted her thoughts and then hal was talking i said did you want to stop by your mamas before we go home she did not answer he seemed to have a knack for making her do things she never planned on doing but if she wanted him she had to want the car there wasnt any sense in even thinking about fixing up the house now all their extra money would go for gas but at least he had come back to her and somehow nothing else was very important she settled back into the seat her eyes drawn to the profile of his headthe hair closely cut his eyes so intent on the road that if she had not known better she would have expected traffic miraculously to appear no she said putting the paper bag on the seat between them the children are going to want you to play with them before they go to bed we might as well pick up the baby and go home

r damon millers wife passed his chair twice she was  making trips from the £aic§ table to the refrigerator in order to set the table for a little party for the two of them they had been talking of the event which gave rise to this party she had done the more talking while mr miller had done the more thinking the more remembering yesterday he had bought for her the huge bouquet of carnations now on the table in front of him he also had bought a set of french paring knives and a little gold locket he was remembering the look she gave him when he had given her those gifts she had grown into the opposite of what she might have or even should have her hands when she placed the candle holder on the table were two stubby cups of flesh masses of flesh it seemed matched only by the ringlets which comprised her neck her two gray eyes settled into her hugeness of body until she looked very much like a great carnivorous monster when she came near his chair he diminished in size he felt that if she said again happy anniversary he would simply disappear behind the impact of her strong clear voice he hoped she would not say this he couldnt bear to hear her say another word he grew ashamed for these thoughts but they became more intense on her third trip she brought two small vegetable salads going around his chair clumsily on her overburdened feet he did not move she would certainly say but dear you promised to sit with me dont leave please really dont you promised    like a childs record her voice would catch his ears and the fat hands would clutch his own    damon    dear he made himself sit deathly still he looked at his watch it was ten of seven now she sat heavily upon a chair she had shredded a carrot and had begun to eat it in a testy manner in the same way he had watched her as she tasted a bit of each of the courses for the party during the early years of their marriage he had urged her to eat for she had been a finicky and fussy nibbler then he delighted in putting his hands around her waist and lifting her into the sky although he was himself of almost the same height and weight as she now she made two of him he could hear her saying something punctuated with the word dear but it seemed to him that she had no right to be endearing herself to him that this strange fat creature with whom he had been sitting for two hours should make no reference at all to him for  years he had sat at this table at seven oclock eating his dinner with her across from him for  years he had told her about his job as fireman on the train she had listened and made comments she had smiled and perhaps he had been humorous and they had planned something or they had regretted having no family no children the candles glow caught the sparkle in her eyes she was looking from the candles to the cake on which was the lovely candied decoration he stood kissed her cheeks he smiled at her but she didnt seem to notice amazed he sat and looked at her it occurred to him that she had ceased to actually see hear or feel his presence then she glanced at him he became numb well dear she said arent you    after all its our    he knew what she would say he knew the whole drama the set piece and the dialogue just a second he got up from the table he could hear her chuckling to herself as he walked down the hallway in their bedroom he took his payroll check from the cash envelope and endorsed it it was what he always did on fridays she could cash it tomorrow she always did on saturdays he put the extra cash into his pocket and into a valise he put clean socks handkerchiefs and shirts he must hurry get out out if he heard her voice just once more he could waste time around the station until the train left at eightthirty they would not be unduly curious afterward he could begin to become anonymous as he glided past the door he could hear the tinkle of silver she was eating he laughed aloud to himself but he was careful not to allow the door to slam he glanced at his watch and shook it furiously for it still stood at ten of seven and then he began to run very fast for a man of his age very very fast 
noblesse oblige
by eloise greenfield
knew it was  tuesday before the m dream was finished by the time she «£vjtiic» opened her eyes she had progressed through the various phases of anticipation from vague contentedness to the realization that this was the day of her weekly visit to the childrens home in the city james would be sitting in his chair by the window waiting for her she stretched and tinges of pink bespattered her skin as she thought of james a blanket of wellbeing enclosed her in its warmth most of the children at the home were slightly reserved but he was extremely so and few emotions stirred the surface of his dark face though his reticence formed a barrier between them marian was confident that with patience she would be able to free his natural ebullience it was a pity she thought that so many people lived without giving of themselves to others and missed the gratification that came with witnessing the transformation of a face by gratitude they leave their religion at the church door she often told fred getting up marian slid her feet into the mules beside the bed and put on the yellow flowered robe she thought with pleasure of her other tuesday appointment passing the bathroom she went down to the kitchen where danny had left the milk on the table and the absence of dirty pans told her that breakfast had again consisted of a sandwich ill have to speak to him about that she thought breaking an egg into the small frying pan she felt a twinge of guilt about not cooking breakfast for danny and fred but her plans to relinquish some of her exhausting charity positions had to wait until there was someone to replace her intuition told her that it was probably for the best since a twelve year old should be taught a sense of responsibility and fred ate at a cafe near the office she assumed the traditional position of reverence and asked a blessing before beginning to eat marians model had been her father in moments of discouragement and weariness she conjured up the vision of john hinton a tax lawyer not very high on the social ladder but towering and stately in his humility and concern for others remember daughter hed said frequently in his chantlike bass noblesse oblige we the noble must honor our obligations the hobo who had come to their door when marian was ten or eleven was a permanent and often used fixture in her memory he had been almost chinless and his face was a puffy chocolate with black borders of hair on each side the family had been about to start dinner when her father answered the knock at the back door mr hinton had stridden back to the dining room removed his dinner from the table plate and fork included and given them to the hobo through the window marian had watched as the man thanked him with several slight nods of his head and sat on the steps to eat there had been a fleeting enigmatic flame in his eyes that frightened her so that she had looked at her father for reassurance mr hintons chin was thrust forward at an angle that was familiar to marian and made her secure once more his eyes glowed and a thwarted smile hovered at the comers of his mouth he had never seemed taller than when he reentered the house filled another plate and joined the family at the table when they had finished dinner the hobo the plate and the fork had disappeared well thats the way they are mr hinton had lamented all we can do is keep trying upstairs again marian found that she had lingered too long over breakfast to take a bath sponging herself quickly she lotioned and dabbed cologne in strategic spots she dressed carefully in matching blue lingerie and the dark blue sheath dress that accentuated her height and combed her brown hair into the soft style that fred liked marian always tried to please fred because she didnt love him she thought of him as her captor a kind unwitting captor but one who had frustrated her plans for a life of service to the unfortunate as an adolescent she had visualized herself in the sparkling white of a nurse or as a dedicated social worker bringing comfort into the hovels of the poor to have married because of a pregnancy that turned out to be a false alarm was the irony of her life she bitterly regretted the naivete of little marian just out of high school who had chosen marriage over the other alternative marian went into dannys room and hurriedly scrawled a note on his bulletin board sandwiches for breakfast ill be home about  leftovers in refrig  got home too late to see you last night so love love love glancing at her watch she saw that she would have to rush in order to keep both appointments the second was as important to her as the visit with james if not more so she snatched one of dannys old books from the shelf and dropped it into her purse before she left as marian drove she practiced the nursery tune she would teach james today if she had enough time the sun glinted on the car  hood making in conjunction with passing shadows varicolored figures that danced to her music she had almost driven past lauras when she remembered that her friend had asked for a ride into the city thanks for the lift laura said sliding into the car i have some shopping to do at taylors for the kids how are harry and the kids marian asked pulling out again into the traffic just fine harrys staying at the apartment in the city tonight weekly meeting marian wished silently that laura would occasionally think of someone other than harry and the kids that she would show some concern for children like james who were the result of immorality and neglect she ached at the injustice that allowed these children to suffer because their parents wanted nothing more than to live like animals gratifying every whim without thought of consequences she saw her duty clearlyto teach cleanliness and morals to those less fortunate no matter how difficult it was after dropping laura off at taylors marian continued the drive to the childrens home she found james in the recreation room not playing with the other children but as always sucking his thumb and staring out the window hello there she said cheerfully extricating his thumb yourefive now james much too big for that james bottom lip gave a weak tremor but she pretended not to notice she tucked his shirttail into the faded green boxer shorts between the shorts and socks that had long since lost their elasticity thin ashen legs projected marian made a mental note to bring lotion the following week she stroked his head briskly with the brush shed bought for him and wiped his shoes with a piece of tissue she first dampened with her tongue thats better she told him now if youll just smile youll be almost as handsome as my little boy james extended his lips sidewards in a straight line taking from her purse the book shed brought marian sat beside him and read with enthusiasm speaking distinctly and changing her voice for all the different characters james sat quietly showing no reaction once when his thumb started slowly toward his mouth she stopped it without looking up and without anger deceit she realized was another enemy for her to fight she understood that it wasnt his fault the halfhour was over before marian finished the story but she couldnt remain longer or she would be late for her other appointment she left the book with james after coaxing him to smile and say thank you traffic was surprisingly light on crawford st and marian was relieved she was hardly in a mood to fight each inch of the way this had been her fourth visit with james and still there was not a sign of improvement she wondered whether any good could come of a sacrifice that evidently wasnt appreciated she was sure that even her father if he were alive would agree that james was beyond help next week she decided she would request another child pulling into the department store parking lot she maneuvered into the one space left on the first ramp walked through the store and left by the main entrance she walked four blocks east just as she reached the white stone apartment building on the corner of fourth and jefferson an envelope dropped from the pocket of a boy who passed her young man she called picking up the envelope she smiled brightly to show her friendliness as she handed it to him although the boy was obviously not yet out of his teens his composed brown face and his poise as he thanked her revealed a peculiar maturity he bowed low a grateful smile creasing his face but his eyes were the eyes of the hobo from her childhood and her fright was a relapse into the past the boy turned and left but this time marian had read the eyes correctly she was positive she would never understand them she had tried to help him and he had responded with hatred oh well she thought with a brave toss of her head noblesse oblige she forgot the boy as she turned  into the building and with a surge of emotion rode the elevator to harrys apartment
