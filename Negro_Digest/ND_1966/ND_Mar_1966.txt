while watching the rew cent pattersonclay fight an interesting thought occurred to me as the two dark sinewy goliaths danced about like ideas under the bright american klieg lights in a fundamental sense the difference between these two people is that patterson is a negro and clay is a man it occurred to me that the image of uncle tom is not a dangerous one in this country but the image of the negro is but before i go further perhaps i should first define him the negro is a man of apparent african ancestry he was born and has since lived in american society he lives and works with people a vast majority of whom have no apparent african ancestry he takes a dim view of his own african ancestry and knows little usually absolutely nothing about it if he adopts a foreign country it will more likely be a european than an african or eastern one he believes his racial lineage is a dark secret hopelessly muddled by intertribal interracial interbreeding after the arrival of the african slaves in the new world hence his past is considered of little or no significance to him in his present life his entire world is defined by the presence the opinions and the attitudes of the white majority who live in his society he relies upon their aid and good will for his health his safety and his general welfare and is conscious as he is constantly reminded of this reliance he accepts this majoritys standards of speech dress and behavior as his own and pushes himself and his family to achieve them he envies and admires their station in life their standard of living and their physical characteristics he harbors no resentment no malice no repugnancy no indignation for any catastrophe suffered by any of his race at the hand of the white majority except as these may be provoked by an isolated event he aspires to be loved by all people and puts special stock in expressions of love and respect or consideration as these may come to him from white people he has ambivalent attitudes toward other negroes and is generally envious of those above him in education or status as he despises and finds himself unable to understand those beneath him in education and status because in truth he has no history no race no class and no identity he is at the same time every man and no man he is in a word what the white man has made him what kind of posture should be expected of a manand throughout this discussion man should be underlinedwith black skin in the american environment would such a man be indignant at his treatment some of the time most of the time all of the time would he express his indignation at every opportunity rarely ever james baldwin has said that to be black in america and be reasonably perceptive is to be in a constant state of rage if this be true and i believe it is what is meant when a quiet obsequious understanding negro is known by whites as a good negro a nice colored fellow an i wish all negroes were like you type person the answer is that he is being recognized as a negro and an opinion is being reserved not expressed or negatively expressed on the question of his manhood hence the statements should have little meaning except to white people and should cause black people to wince one cannot drive in neutral along the ways and byways of race in this country particularly if you are of color the massiveness of the experience has a way of posturing you from the negro one knows not what to expect for he is rather like a straw in the wind  being tossed hither and thither by the vagaries of his own thought and that of the majority culture which dictates its content for the man who has black skin there is no doubt as to his posture so long as the plight of his people is as bad as it is you may expect at the very least an intelligent demurrer more often than not when the question of race is brought up he is indignant the emotion is not unhealthy psychologically or socially given the problems to be solved in our racially sick society the most constructive emotion is that which leads to indignation and a resolve to do something about the situation only a man a full human being has the capacity both to feel indignation and methodically resolve to dry up its source at any cost nonhumans like dogs can be pulled by the ears and kicked in the rump by a master for years and when thrown a bit of sap will forget the earlier indignities overlook the vulnerability to future indignities and yelp with unrestrained glee the same may be observed of babies who suffer indignities before the age of intelligent perception the same may not be said of men nor of nations or not of such of these as have survived the surest evidence that the negro has not been granted the right to manhood in this country is seen in the denial of the right to be indignant however the right to indignation i would defend is the right to intelligent indignation this is not an attempt at snobbishness rather it is a recognition that in any mature society temper tantrums are not long and regularly to be tolerated from adults this brings us to a consideration of the variety of indignation expressed by the black muslims which this writer is not prepared unequivocally to defend the muslims are considered a hate group not so much because their social doctrine necessitates it but rather because they do such unintelligent things as making ceremonious reference to whites as devils the enemy and worse such childish rhetoric is totally unnecessary and superfluous to the ends the muslims themselves seek the muslim creed represents a variety a brand of black nationalism the central theoretic assumption of black nationalism is that before the negro can ever be truly free he must effect a psychic separation from the idea of whiteness that is he must stop believing in it so much that he cannot believe in himself the muslim idea of a separate state is a reification of this slightly more complex notion and it puts it by making it concrete in terms the uneducated layman can grasp if one can entertain the notion of a physical separation from whites and can accept this idea with equanimity then it becomes proportionately easier to come to grips with the idea of a mere psychological separation the muslims realize and rightly so that it is impossible utterly impossible for a negro to be consistently of service to his people so long as he is hung up on the idea of whiteness and all this entails their aim is to make the socalled socalled negro of use to the race as a whole they realize they must first pry him away from his obsession with whiteness and they try to do this in the only way they presently know to do it as often happens in the affairs of men they fail because there means defeat their ends every organization or individual does have the prerogative to express its or his indignation in any way seen fit intelligent or unintelligent the unfortunate thing about the muslim choice is that an otherwise excellent program for individual and group improvement is drowned out in a course of hostility from negroes and whites alike their program could succeed without the allegiance of whites but not without that of blacks white opinion in america unfortunately runs only a truncated course before it becomes negro opinion though the converse of this is rarely true and thisthe logic of thisthe muslims have not been careful to bear in mind one report that a muslim publication has headlined the white race as devils shapes more attitudes than a million reports of positive accomplishments by the group in large part because the white race is paranoid about such things and in equally large part because opinion in america is shaped by newspapers and television and these media feast on the sensational rather than the qualitatively newsworthy unless the muslims change their miserable public relations the logic of this is that the possibility of the organization ever becoming an effective force in the black community is nil none and the negro will live on in all his vainglory yet they are to be complimented for reflecting more humanness than negroes or negro organizations are generally able to muster when they are hurt they bleed and become indignant and humane people respect them for this human beings respect all human beings who become indignant in the face of civil wrongs human beings are not expected to act as negroes have acted in the face of outrages and many people have marveled at the patience and restraint managed by the negro freely translated this means that they would not have been so restrained had the outrages been committed against them but then they are not negroes so there you have it for a time negroes stopped acting like negroes and their organizations stopped acting like negro organizations and for the first time the negro people had a whiff of manhood in the early s the wife of a famous white southern judge who tired of the negro charades in south carolina was forced to exclaim if you want to know what i think you people can do you can stop praying and get off your knees and fight shortly thereafter a wave of negro indignation did sweep the country and people all over the world rallied behind the negro cause as they saw an angry people take to the streets invade theretofore sanctimonious private property and serve notice in a very often  violent and vituperative tone that they were fed up and wanted the white man to get his foot off the black mans throatin a word saying everything the muslims have said since the time of fardexcept that white people were not called spineless devils for the first time people came to talk of the courage and bravery of negroes at a time when they were doing battle with the white community rather than when they were engaged in the obsequious waiting action the negro himself took pride in his new posture and many for the first time could greet caucasians with heads held high people began to talk of a sense of pride and dignity felt by the young people who participated in the demonstrations the truth is that for the first time these peopleoften against the better judgment of their elders abandoned their negroness and became human beings this is the most crucial question that must be posed and answered before there can be a solution to the race problem in  the united states it is in a word whether it is possible to be both negro and human what kind of category is negro does it rule out indignation pride dignity given our situation in american society it is here submitted that we are only human when we are angry or indignant like king in pursuit of injustice or cassius clay when he faces a white world that would forbid his being anything other than their image of a negro when we achieve our racial manhood we will live daily with a resolution to protect our sense of self worth in the fullest possible manner and perhaps the negro will of necessity be laid to rest in relative peace with uncle tom
how many negroes read the new york daily news the los angeles times the new york times presumably substantial numbers the audiences of such journals like the audiences of the television news shows are not segregated and yet the negro already fighting against the neighborhood school and de facto segregation in housing has to contend with still another separatist institution the press what is usually called the pressas in power of or freedom ofis a white press distinctly different from negro press the white press plays two roles in the race situation first because negroes read it it is one of the agencies through which the pervasive ideas of the culture are introduced into the ghetto at the same time the press unconsciously reinforces white attitudes which make it impossible for the negro to escape from the ghetto one of the pervasive ideas in american society is that publicity is a great healing agent once a bad situation has been exposed the belief is it somehow magically goes away the negro cause has had wide publicity in recent years a good deal of the publicity has been concerned with the funerals of negro martyrs but legislation voting rights riots and negro leadership have had a large amount of journalistic attention too in the minds of many middleclass white people this publicity solves the problem who needs a house if hes got the headlines the negro poor for their part have discovered to their subsequent embitterment that despite all the tv newspaper and magazine coverage of race relations the rats go right on biting the babies in harlem thus a social phenomenonthe nationwide belief in the curative powers of publicity has increased tension between negro and caucasian the white press obviously aspires to influence thought for it employs besides its regular editorial writers whole coveys of commentators syndicated columnists writers of thinkpieces pundits political experts etc but over and over these opinionmakers unwittingly reveal that they write for the white communitys point of view and not as spokesmen for the whole republic for example when there are negro riots the white editorialists point out that the negro leaders are middle class and cannot control the negro poor but they omit to mentionnot out of unscrupulousness but because it does not occur to themthat there are no white leaders who can control the white poor bombings night riding beatings up intimidation and assassination are activities of the white poor which parallel negro riots and from local mayor to american president from local constabulary to the fbi there have been no white leaders able to control them a famous political columnist announcing after the rochester riots of  that the black community must learn to discipline its unruly elements is voicing the sentiments of a white press similarly the idea is often put forward in the press that the negro should be worthy of the vote whereas in america nobody has to be worthy of the vote the right to vote is something one is born with if he is an american citizen and save for convicted felons it cannot be withheld on grounds that ones behavior fails to please more than that a vote is something that belongs to an individual as a right it has nothing to do with a group to which he may belong negroes are adjured by caucasian journalists to obey the law of the land no matter what their grievances and respect for the law is held up to them by these writers as an obligation which takes precedence over any injury however lasting or however mortal only a bare handful of the political deansand sages remember to add to their exhortation to negroes the reminder to whites that a law on the books is meaningless if it is not properly enforced according to drew pearsons syndicated column of september   which reads more as if it came from the negro press than the white only four registrars had as of then been provided for the entire state of mississippi there is supposed to be one registrar per county and there are  counties in the state the law of the land rhetoric impresses white readers but must it not convince negroes that american journalism insofar as it tries to influence opinion is basically dedicated to the status quo and the continuing comfort and convenience of white people negroes cannot possibly forget that the murderer of medgar evers has not been convicted nor the murderers of emmett till the murderers of the three young civil_rights workers and the murderers of countless other negroes or friends of the negro a negros experience with and reaction to the law of the land is different from a white mans and unless the white reader is also reading the negro press he cannot safely feel that he has gotten the full picture one liberal white columnist with an otherwise good record for supporting the negro cause recently stated that the adam powells precisely because they were congress men with power to get things done are chiefly responsible for the miserable conditions of their own districts but how much power do ghetto congressmen have in reality in the event that adam powell had had a vision on the road to damascus and become quite a different person could he have cleaned up and regenerated harlem to give them credit the opinionmakers in the white press rarely themselves maintain that the negroes are going too far and too fast but many of them quote with editorial clucking sounds polls which allege that large numbers of white people feel this way and thus give their readers a kind of crowd sanction for obstructionist feelings and perhaps actionsabout racial equality when negroes march and pray and demonstrate in the streets and cause trouble they are frequently toldin newspapers white people readthat they are doing their cause more harm than good and that they should take their wrongs to court the negro has been in the courts for a long time the supreme court decision of  was the culmination of many years struggle in the courts and back in the s the naacp under the leadership of such men as walter white began to fight case after weary case in state and federal courts to end jim crow in interstate buses that was the beginning of the negro strugglenot given publicity until a generation later for integration in public accommodations law and order is not just a matter of negroes putting a lid on their anger or bluecoated policemen putting it on for them to an astonishing extent negroes have themselves shown a respect for law and order behaving with restraint even under severe provocation but law and orderif they are to be lasting and reliable rather than momentary and precariousmust have a sound basis in attitudes and feelings from crispus attucks through thomas wentworth higginsons black regiment to the present leaders of the negro revolution negroes have played a part in american history but when a negro who is aware of this sits down in a negotiating situation with a white man who thinks negroes were merely passive objects for whom lincoln wrote the emancipation proclamation there is a good chance of there being no meeting of the mind perhaps there ought to be more negroes writing for the press with full freedom to explain themselves and to say what is in their hearts then when a white commentator in paragraphs read by millions of white readerswarns negroes hot to alienate the white community a negro commentator in the adjoining column could remind these same readers that many negroes live in hourly peril of the uncontrolled white poor without ade quate protection against injury in advance or redress after it has been inflicted the negro revolution has become almost a comfortable phrase so much has it been in peoples mouths denial of voting rights has had enough coverage so that many whites think that once all the negroes in the country are free to vote unhindered the negro revolution will have succeeded and will pass from the headlines to be heard no more but negro leadership of all kinds both conservative and radical is aware that that is almost a soapopera version of the reality the schools negro children should be attending have not yet been built the teachers who should be instructing in those schools have not yet been hired the housing which should accommodate negroes exists only in token form these things cost money the money can be provided in sufficient quantity only by diverting funds from one or more of our current preoccupations from the space program from the highway program which supports the automobile industry or from the war in vietnam negroes have never been included on terms of equality in our socioeconomic system spending the money to include themand there is no other way they can be brought inwill involve a major reconstruction of our society the press is an established institution and as such is not by nature friendly to the idea of drastic social change but it could contribute substantially to an orderly transition into the future by becoming aware of its own parochial quality it is within the power of the press to make negroes feel less like voices crying in the wilderness and more like people who are being listened to it is within the power of the press to open the eyes of white people to their own insularity
i am speaking as a i white to the whites in the civil_rights movement who threaten at times with their blundering ignorant good intentions to dominate its organizations thereby forcing the negro people to resist this new white superiority and paternalism a minor policy decision was being debated in our local naacp branch meeting the branch the only negro civil_rights organization in this small northern city has spoken for its five percent negro population over the years trying to defend it against as unconsciously cruel and arrogant a white power structure as any that has penned the negro populations in the great ghettos of chicago or new york the naacp here is not yet a mass organization the anger and outrage of our negro community is only beginning to coalesce in organized action present at the meeting were some of the old and faithful negro members a few new ones and the new white liberals wearing the ostentatious smugness that is the reward for salving the conscience with good works the discussion continued for some minutes it was not strictly a blackwhite debate for the negro members were divided on the question the new white liberals were not they were on their feet eager and opinionated i listened without deciding my position quickly i was really not certain that i knew enough to form an intelligent opinion i would vote with the man whose judgment of the problem i most respected and i presumed that vote would be against the white liberal bloc i was right but the white liberal votes carried the motion at the heart of the civil_rights movement in the north the fundamental questions continue to be debated whose civil_rights movement should the basic policymaking within it remain with the negroes if so where do the whites belong should they be relegated to some sort of secondclass citizenship within the movement but is not this the antithesis of the democratic and egalitarian goals of the movement every day of our lives our whole white western culture teaches us that we the white people are superior to the darkskinned peoples of the world without this basic tenet the entire value system of our culture is invalid yet within this culture arises the pity and  compassion that lead many whites to civil_rights activity this is still white superioritythe newest and most enlightened master on the plantation but no less a plantation even the writings of white men of courage and good will reflect this they imply in effect i am infinitely sorry for you because you are black for it is better to be white than black but because you had the misfortune to be born black i will fight for your opportunity and right to try to be as white as i the civil_rights movement does not need these new masters possibly this is the only way a white can approach the negro people and the civil_rights movement his whiteness his western culture are the norm and the goal what else they are indivisible from him like every other white i brought my superiority to the civil_rights movement tempered by the uncomfortable realization that my white skin was probably an offense to some of my negro associates this much i had learned from the negro writers that white is not better than black that the negro people do not want to be white and that many of them dislike whites for excellent reasons it was faintly humiliating that i should be suspect for no better reason than the accident of my skin color then unexpectedly i began to move in my white western culture and so to discover for the first time that it was a prison and not the universe the movement was involuntary and as sudden as an optical trick when a prismatic picture in an instant assumes a different perspective and will not resume its former appearance no matter how hard one stares at it i went out into the street one morning and the crowd of passing white faces were strange faces that i saw for the first time without relation to myself their color the shape of their features was alien and unattractive i sought the occasional negro faces that now looked the way faces ought to look faces that could have some relation to me the faces of strangers in a crowd have never resumed their former perspective the white faces are alien the dark ones familiar this new movement within my white western prison has become a small step toward freedom to see to know and to understand a step into an unutterable loneliness for i am estranged from most white people and i know that i can never pass beyond the barrier of color that separates me from even those negro people i love and am close to we reach toward each other across the barrier with love and need knowing it will remain perhaps a friend in harlem where i was living best defined it youre here now with me but you can go back downtown any day you choose neither of us expected i would but we knew i could we knew i could be accepted without question in white communities that would deny him the right to walk down the street beside me i can never begin to pay my dues for they will never be exacted of me he and every other black person in america pay theirs daily their bitter understanding comes high i would be a fool to expect it free another friend told me sometimes i think for a moment that i hate all whites we both knew at those moments i must be not her friend but just another white were we not close she could not have told me this and i could not have accepted it i am in limbo lonely and free and to try to return to the security of my white prison would be impossible and intolerable thus i approach the negro people no longer with compassion or pity for they are stronger and more free than the whites imprisoned in their western culture i am sorrowful and angry at the treatment of negroes but i cannot pity them simply because they are black pity is for inferiors i know now that i need to live in the negro community among the negro people because that is now where i belong i know my need for them is greater than their need for me ever could be this is not to say that black is better than white there is no better or worse i do not now wish i were black but i am profoundly sorry that i have spent most of my life in prison because i am white and i am afraid i shall never be able to forgive my white western culture for lying to me that it was the universe instead of a prison the negro tots in the ghettos are being gathered swiftly into project head start to remedy the supposed cultural lag their ghettoliving has imposed on them how much more deprived are the white tots in the suburbs and how infinitely greater their need for a crash program to free them from their prisons but there will be no program because those who control programs do not acknowledge their world is a prison for me now activity in the civil_rights movement becomes an attempt to be a good citizen in the negro community where i am necessarily the new and ignorant immigrant i know that i will never walk down the street with a black skin and therefore i can never know with my blood and bones what it is to be a negro for this reason i will never attempt to make policy in the civil_rights movement although i will help with what skills i may have my white skin has made me incapable of ever knowing and understanding the negro community well enough to contribute anything worthwhile to basic decisionmaking for this i do not blame myself nor do my negro friends they and i must accept my heritage probably other whites in the civil_rights movement find themselves in this same position some whites i know are masters on the new plantation to them i say and it may seem blunt and cruel as long as you bring your white superiority and paternalism to the civil_rights movement all your good intentions even your courage and sacrifices are useless and offensive to the negro people negroes do not tell you this for most of them are more polite than i and they tolerate you for your good intentions no free men need despots to direct them least of all the negro people who have been used by white despots in america for centuries they do not want to live on your new plantation let the negroes speak and decide they not you know best this time if you can accept this you may one day move beyond your white prison
one of the current tenets of political science is the importance of the middle class in maintaining both a democracy and a stable governmental structure this is another classic illustration of confusing that which is created with the act of creation what is importantto democracy and to the permanency of governmentis the struggle to join the middle class and not the existence of the middle class per se the distinction drawn above has serious implications for the future of the negro in american democracyand for the future of that democracy professor nicholas rashevsky has demonstrated that a high degree of conformity may tend to reduce the stability of a political system this supports the contention that maintenance of the status quo the lode star of the conservatives which requires conformity is dysfunctional to democracy those who would support the status quo and maintain our society in a state of equilibrium have failed to recognize that in such a society there is no growth no evolution to quote karl deutsch even a casual reading of de tocquevilles the old regime and the french revolution cannot help but impress one with the fact that the middle class in france had never had it so good as in the years immediately preceding the revolution also that the middle class in contradistinction to the monarchy was adamant in its refusal to include the lower class in the benefits of government it was this impermeability of the middle class in france in russia in italy and in germany which can be seen as the root cause of the rise of the authoritarian regimes which had their genesis in the middle class this also is the prospect facing america today there is a noticeable hardening of the line between those who have and those who havenot the maintenance of this line is the prime concern of conservatives proof of this is seen in the coalition of southern democrats and republican conservatives to scuttle through recommittal all measures designed to ameliorate the conditions of the havenots democracy of all the forms of government is peculiar in possessing a dynamic quality it alone of the worlds political systems possesses the qualities to make it a selfdeveloping or selfenhancing system without this dynamic it would become moribund and be transformed into a static state quickly to wither and disappear this dynamic is derived primarily from one political actthe movement of the lower class into the middle class it is this ferment which provides the changes in governmental actions which prevent the hardening of the arteries of democracy the circular movement of those from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top is an essential characteristic of democracy the american revolution was far more than a fight over taxation without representation it was in essence a revolt against the status quoand more importantly a fight to enter the middle class which englands restrictive commercial policies prevented the colonists from joining the protection of englands rising middle class meant using the colony as a source of raw materials and as a consumer of manufactured goods the result was a revolting development to george iii and the beginnings of a middle class in america the current war on poverty is not designed to effect the functional changes in government which the problems of the poor the young the unemployed and the aged demand as howard k smith said in a recent speech it is inconceivable that the richest nation in the world should have the second highest rate of unemployment of the industrialized nations the poverty program is not empowered to tackle such problems as sources of jobs or an adequate means of livelihood for the aged and those unable to work nor can it tackle such problems as housing and the needed infrastructures of schools libraries community centers and hospitals to name only a few of the deficiencies of our society today in social services as statistics show the united states is falling behind other countries one basic area for example is in the number of hospital beds per capita by the governments own statistics the economy can be kept in balance only by cutting taxes or increasing the budget yet the house district of columbia committee forced an increase in the income tax rate of those below the poverty level no effort is being made to increase public expenditures or to decrease the taxes paid by those for whom the payment means being deprived of food the poverty program however will have an important byproduct and one which its proponents probably did not foresee the programs are aimed at stirring the poor from their lethargy and with that stirring will come a demand for the organic changes which are inherent in the phrase the revolution of rising expectations the ferment for change does not arise in those who have no hope for change or do not see it as benefitting them so this byproduct of a program which was rejected by the coalition of conservatives because it will threaten their ability to maintain the status quo will serve to trigger the demand for more basic changes in the distribution of the benefits of government in the great liberal movement in england in the th century there was a strong connection between the efforts of the nobility to broaden the benefits of government to include the poor and the poors reliance upon the nobility to help them it was this liaison which provided the force behind the political changes which eventually revolutionized politics in england this same force is missing in this country today as a result of this void there is no force operating to moderate change and as a result the government continues to operate as a part of the corporate state this trend has been increasing as we move farther away from the great depression it can be seen in the recent republican cry for more guns and less butter this is a typical tactic to deprive the poor of the benefits of government and to preserve the benefits for those who can afford conspicuous consumption with this trend go all the correlates of lessened democracy more police action decreased protection of the rights of the individual lower taxes on greater incomes and most important the reduced ability of the poor to participate in the decisions of government the desire of the poor to participate is met with a cry of mobocracy significantly the right to vote means little when it is nullified by the imposition of economic sanctions this reduction of the ability of the poor to participate in government is the most damaging attack on democracy for it means a reduced electorate this is the real meaning of the opposition to the civil_rights bill the voting rights bill and the home rule bill for the  district of columbia the defeat of home rule for the people in washington means success in a drive to destroy the foundation stone of democracyrepresentation it is an attack on our fundamental belief in local government for if the people in washington are unfit to govern themselves then what large city is capable this is only the latest and most successful attempt to reduce the electorate and to prevent any union between the poor and the believers in democracy for unless the conservatives can succeed in this the benefits of government are apt to be distributed too widely one of the postulates of downs economic theory of democracy is that the economic decisions of a rational government in a democracy are biased against consumers and in favor of producers his reciprocal correlate is that democratic government policies tend to favor lowincome receivers as a class rather than high income receivers consequently because the free market produces a highly unequal distribution of income the more effective democracy becomes politically the greater is government interference with the operation of the economy the conservatives refuse to accept this concomitant result of the free market greater government interference with the economy and a greater distribution of rewards to the low income groups yet as  downs points out so clearly it is only with these offsetting actions that democracy can maintain itself and it is with an effective democracy that a majority of the citizens of the united states are concerned when democracy loses its dynamism it developes a state of equilibrium in a state of equilibrium there can be no upward or downward movement of the people society becomes frozen into a status quo in the united states the gap between the haves and the havenots is steadily increasing this too is the condition of the poor countries of the world the gap between them and the few rich countries is widening consequently just as we have not been able to solve our domestic problems so have we not been able to solve our foreign policy problems the ideal of the greek polis was that all citizens participated in government however the viability of the state rested upon a slave economy and the slaves were not citizens one modern political theory that of professor gabriel almond argues that a democracy requires that a proportion of its citizens play no part in government this nonparticipating group or parochials is a cushion which permits government to be managed by a few participants this theory assumes that the participants in government will consider the needs of the nonparticipants equitably no evidence has been brought forth to support this theory professor almond has merely ratified in a theory the status quo as he found it more to the point is carl friedrichs argument that every sane member of the state must be able to be a political person and to take part in the decisions of government without this a democracy degenerates into an oligarchy in name as well as in fact majority rule means little when a large group of people are unable to participate meaningfully in the determination of their fates and today as never before the government does determine the fates of its people if as all the foregoing would seem to indicate we are engaged in a struggle to maintain the status quo and with it to destroy the dynamic of democracy what then can serve to rekindle this essential dynamism it has been suggested previously that this dynamism rests upon the movement into and out of the middle class the largest group to whom the doors of democracy remain closed is the negro hence in a rare bit of paradox it rests upon the former slaves to restore the ideal of the polis to reality while the negro is only a part of those disenfranchised from receiving the benefits of democracy it is upon him that the burden rests to enfranchise everyone it is upon the efforts of the negro to penetrate the middle class that the prevention of a state of equilibrium depends unless equilibrium is prevented democracy will decline into corporatism the concern of the middle class over what the poor will do if they are permitted to better their lot is an old story it was seen in  when the congress was considering the fair labor standards act some of the members and many of those testifying against the act were concerned over what the workers would do with their leisure time if they were not forced to work long hours for low pay secretary of labor frances perkins reply to them is as pertinent today as it was then they will do the same things the rich do with their spare time this concern over the morals of the poor if they are no longer so poor can be seen as a reflection of the middle class understanding of its own actions the rise in the divorce rate is a phenomenon of the middle class the poor cannot afford the luxury paradoxically the rise in the crime rate is viewed by those supporting the status quo as another reason why the negro should not agitate to join the middle class yet the negro effort to improve his position is a means of reducing the crime rateif the middle class  is free of crime defrauding the federal government through price rigging is obviously a prerogative of the upper middle class so is peddling government influence the industrial revolution beginning after the civil war marked a period of corruption in business and government unequalled in our history this cataclysmic period of rugged change represented an almost wholesale movement to join the middle class the tactics used to suppress the poor then are equalled only by the tactics still used in the south to maintain a cheap labor market it was this violent effort to produce change which remodeled the face of america violence was justified then as defense of property rights those who were successful now decry violence in defense of human rights those bloody years and they continued through the s were in defense of the status quo the right of those who have to have and the denial of the right to all others those were the years which laid the foundation of americas greatness those were dynamic years for the economy if not for democracy the dynamic has gone out of the economy it is continuing to expand but as has been pointed out those at the bottom are sinking lower as the top rises higher there is no servomechanism in a democracy which acts as a governor to brake the decline of the poor they must do this for themselves and the only way they can do it is through agitation to force society to adjust its economic social and political policies so that all will benefit equitably in the proceeds of democracy the imperatives of democracy are many but none is more basic than that summed up in the phrase to promote the general welfare it is enshrined in our constitution as a fundamental tenet to which all who believe in the constitution must subscribe recently the executive director of the international association of police chiefs said we are tired of the cry that because one segment of our population has been deprived for  years the balance of society must accept  years of anarchy the director is of course confused to struggle to participate in a democracy is not anarchy it is only to seek to perpetuate the existence of that democracy certainly this means upsetting the equilibrium of society just as society was upset during the industrial revolution when the great bulk of the middle class was being formed the great danger to democracy as history plainly shows is when there is equilibrium and the frustration of change our problem today is not to worry about achieving complete democracy our problem is to keep striving for it how are we to advance democracy the answer would seem to lie in the negroin his determination to participate in all the aspects of democracy this means as watts has shown a disequilibrium in society and the safeguarding of democracy
since the supreme court decisionalmost twelve years ago declared integration of schools in the united states to be the law of the land it is necessary to consider an aspect which flows from this decision namely the need for and progress toward integration of the materials of learning and teaching this refers to lesson plans teaching units textbooks graphs charts pictures and audio and visual aids it should be evident that integration in education is not achieved by merely permitting negro and white children to sit together in the same classrooms or to attend the same schools an examination of the learning materials which have been in use is in order they too should be imbued with the same democratic concept which brought forth the historic decision if the negro child is short changed by being set apart in a segregated school it is found that he has been doubly harmed when the teaching materials are examined relative to their treatment of him in general either there is slight reference or complete omission of the negros cultural and historical contribution or such materials are ridden with misconceptions stereotypes and slanting distortions such treatment only serves to strengthen the white majority in their superiority attitude while the negro minority is led further into accepting the myth of inferiority naturally these learning materials reflect the attitude of the society in which we live the writers of these materials and those who produce them have been reluctant to admit that negroes have made any real contribution to the history or culture of the united states or to world civilization for that matter why have the contributions of the negro been ignored or distorted in our learning materials because the truth i submit would be a direct refutation of the philosophy of white supremacy which is prevalent in our country the history and culture of the negro has been presented in terms of a people who are passive stupid and incapable of creative efforts this has been reflected in the thinking and writing of many eminent historians and textbook writers unfortunately this point of view has been mirrored in curriculums texts and learning materials through the years for this reason not only has the negro citizenry been denied truth knowledge training and skills but white america has been deprived of an appreciation of the contributions of a large segment of their fellow citizens thus the white child grows into adulthood with a sense of false superiority based on the color of his skin alone he feels that he does not have to try that all he has to do is to be white this concept ends in rude disillusionment and mental upsets when persons with this outlook come face to face with the realities of life when the truth is presented these people will find that all peoplewhite yellow red and yes blackhave made worthwhile contributions to society civilization and american life and history and have helped to make a better life for all mankind they will find that there is no room in the life of an intelligent and cultured person for prejudice and racism a correct portrayal of the contributions of the negro to american history in textbooks and teaching materials will not only benefit the negro child but the white child will be the richer if this information is made available to him he will receive a realistic concept of the contributions of anglosaxons to society civilization and the building of the united states previously his conception of his role in society has been distorted principally to bolster the theory of white supremacy just as the negro child from infancy has been given false impressions so also has the white child the biased presentation of his cultural contribution has harmed the negro child in many ways there is a direct connection between the question of a positive image for the negro american and the programs to aid the poverty stricken and culturally deprived negroes are culturally deprived and poverty stricken in the sense that they are lacking in knowledge of self the millions of dollars appropriated to combat these conditions in our country might well go down the drain unless this question of identity positive self image heritage negro historycall it what  you willis faced up to only through a positive reorientation on this matter will the negro american regain his dignity of fourhundred years standing in his country a bit closer to home however the problem of school drop outs among negro youth is closely related to this question school systems all over the country are grappling with this problem has it occurred to the counselors and community workers on behalf of such programs that there is a kinship between school drop outs especially in the case of negro students and the absence of positive knowledge regarding the negro in learning materials    we cannot expect the negro child to have positive images to identify with if he is seldom presented with a positive image the void is not only evident in the books he reads but is equally apparent in the pictures and films he sees and in the stories he is told about people who have made heroic contributions from nursery school through college he is confronted with a black black outa brainwashing that says in a hundred different ways whites achieve and progress and blacks do not and of course he is able to observe that the color bias operates in a manner to make it possible for whites to realize their aspirations on their merit ability or talent and to thwart and frustrate blacks with ambition denied knowledge of the participation of his people in the building of the united states and the fulfillment of the american dream the negro child grows up lacking a true sense of his own worth and future potential believing that he is nothing and knowing nothing from nothing leaves nothing he fails to aspire herein are some of the real roots of a negro school drop out failing to receive a sense of pride in accomplishment identity and belonging such young people may well lose faith in their democratic heritage this further emphasizes the need for a reexamination of learning materials in respect to the true contributions of the negro this gap in the education of negro youth must be filled his pride in the accomplishment of his forebears will instill confidence in the future inspired with meaningful examples after which they might pattern their lives negro youth will enrich the entire american society with their deeds integration of the materials of teaching and learning will not only enrich the school population of the country but will delineate the full intent of the supreme court decision this calls for additional research and much revision and rewriting the path of least resistance is to refuse to recognize the problem and to continue in the old way with the biased materials and the conventional and accepted outlook but how long can we keep our heads buried in the sand throughout this country there is a clamor from integrationists and civil_rights groups for school systems to do something about the inclusion of the teaching of negro history they mean by this the integration of teaching materials their demands are proper and few school boards or systems would disagree however lacking from these groups are practical suggestions for the implementation of their demands a school board or system is faced with certain questions are current texts and materials to be junked revised or rewritten is socalled negro history true american history to be taught in predominantly negro schools or in all of the schools will the publishers or producers of such materials take the initiative to provide them for the school systems or will the school systems have to create and produce their own materials the solution to the problem is intricate but it is not unsolvable herein will be found exciting work for historians textbook and juvenile writers curriculum and guidance workers teachers and last but not least publishers and producers of these materials since heretofore such little attention has been paid to these materials many will have to be ereated the missing pages of history relating to the negro will have to be written into units lesson plans readers language and historical texts they will have to be diagramed and drawn into pictures charts films film strips and recorded onto tapes and records since only an infinitesimal amount of this material is available school systems themselves may well have to take the responsibility of producing their own materials if the publishers fail to provide it committees of teachers administrators and specialists in the field of negro literature and history might be appointed to review and make recommendations for positive changes and additions to texts curriculums courses of study learning units and teaching materials their aim should be to reflect the positive contributions not only of the negro to society civilization and american history but of other ethnic groups who have been neglected or ignored as a result of such surveys school systems could then inform the publishers of what they wish to have included in the materials which they purchase or they may endeavor to produce their own materials similarly to what has been done in detroit washington dc and new york city such a program will be costly but the price of educational and cultural deprivation must be paid if we wish to bolster and protect our democracy the nation will not only be enriched but it will be doubly reimbursed if it brings out of this period of turbulent social strife a proud united new generation of american youth the white youth cognizant of and respectful of their negro fellow citizens the negro youth a proud american who has found his identity the needs are obvious if through our inaction we render ourselves helpless in the face of this great challenge it is almost certain that we also will render ourselves helpless toward making the american dream more than just a dream 
in his powerful work i the wretched of the earth which has been called a revolutionary bible frantz fanon made this brilliant observation now the fellah the unemployed man the starving native do not lay a claim to the truth they do not say that they are the truth for they are the truth fanons words were written with direct reference to the masses of natives visavis the native intellectual or the native who had adopted the forms of thought of the colonialist bourgeoisie at the time of the writing fanon was one of the most articulate spokesmen for the algerian revolution but inherent in fanons writings was a profound concern for oppressed blacksthe colonized the world over including this land that he described as a former european colony that decided to catch up with europe according to fanon it succeeded so well that the united states of america became a monster in which the taints the sickness and the inhumanity of europe have grown to appalling dimensions it is interesting to note that his early death of cancer which occurred on these shores might possibly have been avoided had he not feared coming to this country for treatment a bit ironic perhaps but his fears were not so unreal nor were they based on myth for they are the truthso simple so mighty and so many implications and the fellah fanon spoke of very definitely inhabits this land and he isin this land no less the truth than in fanons adopted algeria we have for so many years attempted to avoid him to not see him and upon seeing him we have pretended that we did not but we know who the fellah is in this country but the fellah in recent times has forced us to look at him to see him and he has made it increasingly difficult for us to deny his pres ence and his condition moreover he has forced us to listen to him to hear himalbeit our response to him more often than not makes one wonder we have seen him erupt in harlem and watts and we heard him through the voice of brother malcolmand to think that malcolm did not speak for the fellah simply because they were not card carrying followers is really not to think at all let us for our purposes define the chosen ones quite simply those blacks among us who in words actions inaction and indifferenceand we know who we arelay a claim to the truth the fellah also knows who we are after all we are so easily identified but the marks of identification that come to mind are not so superficial as the clothes we wear or the houses we live in more precisely the chosen ones are given to a pattern of thought and reflex that is indeed pronounced one of the more obvious marks of identity of the chosen ones is the predictable nature of their telling comments on the fellah the chosen ones comments on the fellah for the most part lack validity and are often quite unintelligent although the chosen ones think themselves rather learnedhowever they are indeed telling to be sure they are telling about ourselves another mark of identity is the chosen ones reactions to the fellahhis words his actions and his very existence the right to which is often challenged by the reactionary nature of the chosen ones but alas the chosen ones manage to sympathize with the fellah when he rebels or do they perhaps it is more accurate to say that the chosen ones experience a vicarious orgasm of the soul when the fellah rebels for you see in a very real sense the fellah is rebelling for the chosen ones who with such painful ramifications have conceded the right to rebel for the right to be among the chosen ones the right to serve the guardian and the guardian of course is the white man and to elaborate on the exceptions is to indulge in futile exercise whitey is the guardian who not out of kindness or brotherhood or any such myth but out of intense fear has taken upon himself the chosen ones in a desperate attempt to protect himself from the fellah with unequaled resolve he has designed in this valley of rampant timidity a peculiar niche wherein the chosen ones reside in all their misery and the suffering of the chosen ones is apparent for many reasons paramount among the reasons for their misery is the inescapable fact that in each of the chosen ones there dwells some fellah that same fury is cradled in his psyche that same desperation buried in the pit of his belly but unlike the fellah when his emotions demand that he rebel his debt to the guardianthose special dues of the chosen onesdemands that he repress although the indoctrination of the chosen ones has insured certain mechanical reactions to given situations involving the fellah his emotions do not and perhaps cannot respond to this specific indoctrination emotionally the chosen one remains a fellah hence his emotional response is in direct conflict with his physical response resulting in a vicious paradox witness the language of the chosen ones within the confines of safety they will talk of things being soulful nitty gritty and funky but they will unfailingly avoid this ethnic behaviour whenever the atmosphere suggests that their place might be jeopardized in the presence of the guardian the chosen one is allowed to act like a fellah only if the guardian is acting like a fellahand exceptions to this rule are extremely rare let the fellah choose the wrong time and place to become emotional or funky and witness the chosen ones squirm and cringe as their roots become like terrible scorching fires a young black lady a very chosen one who in her words belongs to a very high class church recently conveyed the following incident to me one sunday morning in the presence of a white friend she turned on the tv only to be confronted with the spectacle of a negro church service where they fellahs one guesses were carry ing on she confided that it made her very ashamed i inquired why and asked her if there was something wrong with people praising their god in their way she allowed that there was really nothing wrong with it but that she just thought we should keep such things to ourselves it is rather interesting that she a chosen one should use the pronoun we but nevertheless not at all surprising for even the most catholic episcopal unitarian or what have you among the chosen ones cannot avoid identification with the holy rollers although in complete control of the physical characteristics or manifestations of the fellah in themselves the chosen ones are unable to contain its inevitable rise and at its mildest the fellah in them is much more baptist than catholic but through further questioning i discovered there was much more to her shame it seems that her white friends head drooped at the spectacle alas embarrassed of course the chosen ones obligation to protect the guardian is at that precise moment primary what follows might well be described as emotional prostitution it is sad enough that the chosen ones bag requires that they stand before the guardian begging for that thing called freedom but what is even more sad is that they think it their responsibility to free the guardian from the selfinflicted psychologythe guiltthat makes a guardians head droop at the  sight of those uninhibited holy rolling fellahs and the head droopers and their would be saviours in their collective misery are seemingly incapable of reasoning that if the fellah did not spend all that precious time holy rolling it is quite possible that he would spend it making molotov cocktailsand there are those who would suggest that the production of such might produce more real christians than all of the high class churches have managed to produce to date in this land each of us who has at some juncture played the role of the chosen onewhether by choice or circumstancecan recall at least one cringing experience about ten years ago while riding a bus en route to school a shabbily dressed black man sat next to me he proceeded without apparent qualm to pull out a hamburgerand began feasting well it so happened that there was a shortage of brothers on that bus but there were many guardians present now lets face it if that had been a bus full of brothers i probably would have said something like dig baby my mans goin for himselfwhich translated is like proclaiming the cat soulful or something similarand my emotions would have been quite safe at any rate i would not have been embarrassed by such an incident on a bus full of brothersand what brother would have been but with all those guardians present and my head filled with all that phenomena that once passed as values i did what all good chosen ones would have done then  and still do today  i squeezed against the side of the bus face flush against the window and did my damndest to pretend that either i or my hamburger eating brother the fellah did not exist and that the incident was not really happening what choice did i have how else might i have preserved the pride of the chosen ones and whats a squashed nose when so much is at stake but and i find this very sad it was perhaps four or five years later before i was finally able to question my reaction to the incident before i began to understand it on that harsh day it was so simple for me to condemn the fellah for causing me such great pain he caused me pain well blinded by the cruel plight of the chosen ones i certainly thought he did after all i would not have eaten a hamburger on a bus well perhaps on a bus full of brothers maybe and therefore it was wrongcertainly not very cultured is that not the usual method employed by the chosen ones to condemn the fellahi would not have done it i suggest that such was indeed the usual method and it remains so and the guardians have bestowed upon the chosen ones that great rationale for such godplaying exercisesvalues and culture the chosen ones have acceptedfor better or for worse the values of the guardian and they have no other choice short of abdicating their curious status and the products of this tormenting marriage both the chosen ones and the guardian have the unadulterated arrogance to subject the fellah to those values in a manner that is perhaps without precedent as one mans brazen declaration of superiority over another year after year after year they persist with inimitable audacity in demanding that the fellah respect uphold and keep sacred those dubious values which have to this date in this land served the fellahs interest not one damn bit the result of this vile web the condition of american life today that which all the surveys are about rather compels one to search and search for a rationale that will deem the guardian and the chosen ones something other than the most merciless duo to ever inhabit the earth but the web is so full of lies and the search alas is in vain moreover the accusersthose who deny the fellahs humanity by condemning him for the sins they have committed against him claim the right to their vicious undertaking they have manipulated the teachings of their high class churches so as to defendtheir incredible impositions and judgments on the grounds of a strange barren morality but it is no secret that they are not half as vehement in their efforts to make of themselves and their values something worth respecting the distorted nature of their morality can be witnessed for example in their pretentious inability throughout americas citiesto persecute slum landlords with the same tenacious will that they have employed all these years in their persecution of the very people whose stench degradation and deaths will forever haunt the souls of those same landlords this is but one example of the horror of the american double standard that one might depict ad infinitum and such is the noble status of the sons and daughters of the chosen ones and the guardian and the fellah is hep to them and they know it but the chosen ones cloak their guilt with all the affectations of the catalogue culture and its peculiar dignity what is more american than mail order houses and catalogues you see it you want it you order it its yours you have a lifetime to pay for it and in all probability it isnt worth a damn but everyone has one so so it is the same with the culture that is valued by the chosen ones who have received from the guardian with his blessings the catalogue which carries with it the right to order those things deemed necessary by the guardian to insure  complete control of the chosen ones anyone given the opportunity can grasp all that jazz that is at once a claim to fame and the source most often used to deny the fellahs humanity it is just as easy as that it is nothing more than a catalogue culture all one really needs is the catalogue but the cultured ones have not yet proved that they have the basic decencyin spite of brotherhood weekto share the catalogue with the fellah a fact which implies that they are somehow terribly afraid that the fellah might pass the course in six easy lessons quite like they did before him and no longer would the chosen ones and the guardian loom so mighty in their timid makebelieve minds for as fanon so wisely observed the fellah is the truthabout the rest of us if we are fortunate the nature of love and hate being so entwined perhaps the fellah will eventually save us from ourselves to expect the fellah to join this fraternity of hypocrisy and selfdeception at this late date is to believe in miracles this dreary coalition has conspired to starve men and has sealed the conspiracy with faith hope charity good intentions and a yet unfound democracy but time has worked against us and caught us naked for the masses of victims to joinnowwould be to defy human nature fanon suggested come then comrades  we must find something different and the fellah willit is only a matter of time but what hope is there for the chosen ones and the guardian perhaps the starting point is to look at ourselves to finally question our existence in another country through the voice of the preacher sermonizing over the dead rufus a suicide victim james baldwin spoke profoundly and i tell you something else dont none of you forget it i know a lot of people done took their own lives and theyre walking up and down the streets today and some of them is preaching the gospel and some is sitting in the seats of the mighty now you remember that if the world wasnt so full of dead folks maybe those of us thats trying to live wouldnt have to suffer so bad and he was notwhen he spoke of dead folkstalking about the fellah
the negroes around parisespecially the younger more swinging oneshave found a new sport which like bullfighting is often bloody and more than a little cruel theres an american governmental employee around town who everyone assumes is an agent of the cia central intelligence agency the man makes himself known to all the brothers and proceeds to feel them out relative to their opinions on say vietnam and santo domingo and the race war back home not only that but he asks for all the details of personal life and history such as place of birth university attended etc and it is difficult not to imagine him scurrying back to his apartment to write all this information in his dossiers after a session with some particularly effusive subject well the negroes just put him on something awful they tell him all kinds of wild things and sometimes they sound like theyre  ready to take up arms and fight against la patrie the government man offers all kinds of reasons why america is not so badthings are so much better than they were or many white people are now helping the negroes or negroes have more cars and refrigerators than all the french peopleand he always seems genuinely surprised that no negro agrees with him and when he is asked about all the violence and discrimination directed against negroes at home the government mans standard reply goes something like this well its better than russia you can still try to change things in america but you cant change things in russia but who said anything about russia well its there in the back of the government mans head and out it comes russia communism china    but baby you dont have to worry about communism so much if you make democracy work one refugee from the civil_rights wars told the government man but it didnt sink in nothing seems to sink in really the government man just keeps going from negro to negro collecting his data and being put on and nothing changes the mans ego must be shielded by a tough armor of patriotism not to be ripped to shreds by all the subtle ridicule and hostility he encounters but alas perhaps the bearing of such a burden was an important aspect of his training in intelligence out of simple humanity one hopes so his is a totally unrewarding job for all that information on the dossiers wont change a single fact about racism in america and its destructive effect on black americans
at a recent los angeles conference cosponsored by the american textbook publishers institute and the great cities research council the major subject of discussion was the representation or lack of same of racial and ethnic minorities in the textbooks used in urban education dr evelyn f carlson associate superintendent of the chicago public schools had this to say the materials available now are fine and tremendous the publishers have come a long way dr everett chaffee associate superintendent of the los angeles public schools contributed the following five years ago we were critical now were aware of the lead time publishers need in the past year or year and onehalf material has come on the market dealing with these issues of racial and minority groups im not so worried about this area right now this in spite of evidence to the contrary in a recent saturday review article the allwhite world of childrens books nancy larrick former president of the international reading association stated across the country  nonwhite children are learning to read and to understand the american way of life in books which either omit them entirely or scarcely mention them there is no need to elaborate upon the damagemuch of it irreparableto the negro childs personality it is no secret that chicago lags far behind other large cities in making progress in this area also we are laboring under the assumption that watts is a part of los angeles with this in mind we cant help wondering who the two educators propose to represent when they claim that things are fine and tremendous and there is no cause to worry
it was at the breakfast table in messel a quiet german village near darmstadt that we read the report on last aprils writers conference at the new school in new york in the latest issue of the new school bulletin it first had been published in a japanese review was reprinted in the bulletin and the copy at hand had been mailed to our german host from new york by its author gloria oden an american negro poeteditorlawyer our first reaction to the report was one of sadness not merely because we had seen the writers conference differently in conception and effect but also because we felt the author did not understand the banality and futility of her propositionthat for all practical purposes she was at least a generation behind the times for she was critical of the negro writers at the conference for their refusal to seize the opportunity of a receptive predominantly white audience to seek to persuade them to the writers cause she saw the chance for the establishment of a dialogue and she felt the negro writers had turned their backs had instead resorted to complaints accusations and emotionalism and she proposed that ideally the negro writers should have adopted a more conciliatory pose one has to grant miss oden the possession of seriousness and concern these values at least she shares with the writers she opposes she wishes that the idea of race which divides americans would cease to exist as a problem and she apparently feels that negro writers can help in diminishing the problem by ceasing to emphasize their differences miss oden admits the catalogue of wrongs the negro people endure at the hands of their white compatriots but she would make much of the fact that negro writers and intellectuals spring from a class less affected by these wrongs and she suggests that these writers and intellectuals also have the duty to confront the significance of their privileged status she seems to be reminding the creators of the angry and bitter black characters in recent novels and plays by negroes that there also exist happy black millionaires and even lawyers editors and scientists with life patterns which do not conform to those depicted in the novels and plays it is an argument as tragically shortsighted and ultimately irrelevant as it is old the house slave always emphasized his superiority over the field slave without altering one iota the reality of his condition the paper bag negro elites assumed high caste and social standing without ever losing the stigma or evading the limitations imposed by

harlem is the most surveyed researched storied chronicled and publicized neighborhood in the world yet each year we see a new stream of books articles pamphlets and newsprint coming from that ghetto of color perched atop manhattan the reason for this and the continued interest in harlem is because no one book or collection of books has been able to arrive at a definitive work on harlem gibbons rise and fall of the roman empire did this for a phenomenon as great and as geographically diverse as rome but no one has been able to approach anything similar for harlem perhaps the reason for this is found in the very fact that harlemwhat it is and representsutterly defies definition perhaps harlem is like fire we know what elements go into making it we know what conditions exist to make its existence possible we know the effects it can have and the things it can do to and for people but we do not know what it is in substance any book that uses harlem as a background or point of departure is already limited from the outset to capturing just a small portion of the essence of harlem harlem is every conceivable thing to every conceivable mentality this is not an original idea regarding cities but in harlem its true in spades pun intended bird at my window lippincott philadelphia  is a very sensitive engaging challenging novel by rosa guy it reveals the gradual amoralization of a black man in harlem in doing so miss guy demonstrates an enviable skill in relating the sociological and psychological forces that cause this phenomenon because she does so without preaching or philosophizing equally skillful is the subtle manner she employs to get her points across to the reader it helps if the reader knows harlem however it is essential that the reader know negro ghetto life to get the full understanding and appreciate the real talent gently at work here miss guy does not tell us anything new about harlem that is not her mission what she does is to relate an interesting story and the psychological metamorphosis of a black man in harlem caught up in the matriarchy mores and manipulation common to black america the book for all of its positive values does suffer in several aspects the dialogues sometimes fail to ring true unlikely and falsesounding words and phrases come out of very unlikely mouths at times the book lags but that might be attributed to the impatience of the reader to get on which is something of an indirect compliment to the author with bird at my window we can score another triumph for harlem harlem has produced a continuum of talent dating 
back to the times before the black renaissance of the twenties for despite the poverty horror and shame harlem stands for the chain of talented writers has been unbroken from hughes through wright baldwin and claude brown miss guy is on the threshold of adding another link to that impressive chainbrooks johnson i when the united states sent marines into the dominican republic last spring did it act out of selfish interest and against the people of that country most people who answer yes to that question are called radical and perhaps rightly so santo domingo revolt of the damned g p putnams sons  reveals the inside truth of the dominican republicpast and presentas seen by washington post correspondent dan kurzman a prize winning journalist who has been covering foreign affairs for almost two decades and who cannot be so easily dismissed by using the tag radical the book includes a brief history of the dominican republic and a candid account of our involvement there the pure barbarism of trujillo the latin american hitleris displayed as well as the undeniable fact that we supported him for  years the author describes young rebels in the dominican republic as militantly nationalist and fervently antiamerican with the restlessness and dissatisfaction that characterize youth in most underdeveloped countries scarred by past colonial or totalitarian exploitation and the author has seen most such countries but why this antiamericanism what kind of government or family did we support under trujillo there was the mass murder of  to  haitian residentsno one is certain of the figureduring one  hour period in  trujillo with our support managed to obtain control of more than  of the nations wealth with the remainder going to a handful of partners in his crimes while the populace suffered the trujillo family ended up owning  of the nations sugar plantations  of its  sugar mills  of its best land and compiled a fortune estimated at over  million the tortures used against his foes and anyone who thought he was less than god was an enemyincluded nail extractors decapitation collars leather thonged whips and various electrical devices but as author kurzman points out trujillo was a good friend of the united states after all he paid off his countrys foreign debts always voted the right way in the oas and un kept the streets clean put communists in jail and knew how to keep order in a country that was not ready for democracy juan bosch the man who was overthrown while bringing democracy to the dominican republicdefeated because we refused to help himalso comes through in this book he comes through as a man with many political shortcomings but nevertheless as a man who believed in democracy and was dedicated to his people author kurzman assesses boschs failures but history will be hard pressed to find one greater than his belief and trust in the united states one cannot neglect the history of the dominican republic and expect to understand the situation in that  country today author kurzman in this excellently written and well documerited book brings the truth before our eyes he proves that one can be anticommunism and antiadministration policy although there are those who would find that inconceivable it is noteworthy that the author mentions that most of the poor oppressed persecuted victims of tyranny in the dominican republic just happen to belong to the darker race the author would prefer and this is his right to think that our policy in the dominican republic has been a case of blundering but how long can such blundering persist it is left to the readers subjective conclusion whether we are really so blundering or maybe as history rather suggests we are just plain antipeople especially certain peopledavid llorens  aristotle called him a madman plato thought he was indeed a thing ethereally lightwinged and sacred the dark ages looked upon him as supernatural and primitive cultures even today regard him with an

achievement dr hatterer who has analyzed thousands of artistpatients over the last seven years confines his discussion to those problems distinguishing artists from other patients these include the artistic ego professional rejection creative work blocks fallow periods the need for isolation and consequent loss of meaningful relationships resentments stemming from nonrecognition both by the public and intimates lack of a concrete occupational identity conflict in values with the outside world and others in addition the study clears up some of the timeworn stereotypes regarding the artist including the spurious assumption perpetuated by romantic biographies that creative impulse and mental derangement are one and the same clinical evidence does not support the linkage of genius with insanity dr hatterer asserts rather such evidence contradicts this because in psychosis the artists work is severely impaired however the book does often seem to imply that most artists away from their work have difficulty functioning in society from what we know of the lives of dante shakespeare bach haydn and others as well as latterday artists in all fields it is evident that the human mind can somehow operate both superficially and in those strange trackless regions where art lives there must come a time in the creative sensibility when the world around it seems shallow indeed but most geniuses seem able to descend again and take part in that world often in its most banal pursuits indeed the creative instinct it seems to me defies analysis its very existence implies the nonrational the mystic still for practicing therapists not oriented in the psyche of the artist the book will doubtless prove enlightening for artists themselves it will certainly be of therapeutic valuehamilton bims every historical event has a very vital causal connection with the past such a historic event is the culmination of a series of pertinent factors that have preceded the actual event in question to fully understand the occurrence we must know what the pertinent facts are behind and before the occurrence itself the entering of james meredith into the university of mississippi is probably one of the most completely covered and documented of modern events certainly no other college activity has ever received such publicity andor notoriety so any book that merely rakes over these old coals is not really likely to make much of a contribution but walter lords the past that would not die harper and row  discusses merediths entrance into ole miss and does make a contribution the reason for this is that he has gone deep into mississippi history and provided us with sociological economical and political facts that directly relate to what happened in oxford during those historic days to this extent he provides the reader with background information to better understand the factors and forces at work there this is the second of two books i have read inspired by merediths enrollment at ole miss the other james silvers mississippi  the closed society was also quite heavy in historic background and as a result things that previously were vague and void of meaning took on clarity as a result of reading the book lords book is similar in what it does but he does extend ones understanding of mississippi history a bit differently from silver but putting this aside another area in which the book makes a rather clean incisive and definitive point is the manner in which it dispenses with the old idea that time takes care of everything the idea in question can be posed if mississippi and the south had had more time would they have gradually corrected their own problems mr lord provides us with almost indisputable evidence to the contrary for example he points out that things of the south have not really changed much since civil war days the following is a quote from  about mississippi the respectable people of the state do not discourage the practice of carrying arms by whites as they should they are astonishingly tolerant of acts which would arouse a northern community to the utmost  a willingness to see men take the law into their own hands and what is still worse to let them openly defy the laws without losing apparently the respect of the community but lord does not rely upon the fact that the quote in question could have just as easily been made in  he goes on to statistically make his point the trouble was more time all too often meant that the negro simply drifted further back when mississippi tightened its voting qualifications in  it was argued that negroes were not ready since  were illiterate by  less than  were illiterate but fewer negroes than ever were allowed to register and further nor did more time mean more money for negro education in  negro teachers average  a month in  the figure was  moreover we find that in  the state of mississippi spent three times as much on white education as for negroes in  the ratio was the same so we clearly see that in mississippi separate never was equal and there never was any intention on the part of white mississippians that it should be that way the book is very engaging and informative it is written in a very easy readable style with each point put forth realistically and scholarly supported the meat is in the factual and statistical presentation of facets of mississippi history that shed light and meaning on mississippi today and the fact that they are almost hopelessly chained to the past that would not die
back in antiquity there was a saying that is still very much with us today the saying is render unto caesar that which is caesars and render unto god that which is gods this was a tacit assumption of that fact that there was to be a split between the secular and spiritual realms politicians were to minister to the secular realm and churchmen to the spiritual realm even then there were great conflicts between politician and pope the two swords doctrine manifested in the above quote which was a source of conflict down through the ages still lingers with us of late it is demonstrated in the conflict that goes on within the minds and souls of religious leaders today in the area of civil_rights just how much should a clergyman concern himself with the secular movement of negroes into the street to protest how involved should be get in the basic mundane struggle of black people to leave the ghetto and throw off their ghettorization for negro ministers this has often proven to be a thorny question with no fast and sure answer for many white ministers it has proven to be a question that they have refused to meet head on and have attempted to ignore it whenever and wherever possible but there is a discernible change in their reaction to the civil_rights movements more and more white ministers are coming to the front lines some assuming roles of leaders but david reimers white protestantism and the negro oxford university press  is not so much concerned with what the various white christian leaders are doing but rather    my purpose is to provide the historical perspective for viewing    what they are doing it is perhaps too shopworn to repeat that the most segregated hour in america is sunday morning from eleven to twelve when america is worshipping this is a very provocative and pitiful paradox mr reimers book does help to understand how this blightful fact got to be such understanding the background does not of course cure the ailment but it does provide us with a basis for making intelligent diagnosis and the ultimate application of preventive measures to this end mr reimers book furnishes us with a valuable piece of literature it is perhaps necessarily incomplete because this is not the kind of subject that lends itself to a definitive treatment it is easy and intelligible reading and will give the reader certain historical insights into whys and hows of american white christianity and its relationship to american black people this is what the author sets out to do and after some  pages you get the impression that he has succeeded

the awakenings of africa are numerous and many are lost with that part of history that is conveniently listed as unrecorded it is refreshing to read a book that makes an admirable attempt at recording parts of the more recent political awakening of africa rupert emerson and martin kilson have coedited an interesting book entitled the political awakening of africa prenticehall new jersey  the method of chronicling this more recent awakening is to collect the speeches of some of africas leading nationalists and leaders starting back with j e casely hayford and felix eboue and their special brand of nationalism and continuing down to more current leaders and their brand of african political nationalism the book is outstanding for what is included and the light that it sheds on the basic thinking of african leaders some years ago the book points to the former african desire to better conditions within the existing framework of political domination by for eign powers the goal of these early leaders was to convince the ruling powers that the african was worthy of better treatment on one hand and to make the african more deserving and faithful to the colonial country on the other as stated above the book is impressive for what it says but it is also impressive because it does not say as much as one would like hearing the leaders of africa past and present talk about african political problems is a very enlightening and realistic method of understanding what the african thinking and goals really were and the methodology they sought to employ to realize these ends the amount of literary and intellectual salt the reader has to apply to get a full understanding is correspondingly reduced when the subject matter is presented in this fashion the upshot of all this is that one is impressed with what is said and how but really wishes that the authors had given us more while the old theatre axiom always leaving wanting more is good theatre technique the result of the same feeling here is that the reader is left partially pleased but generally frustratedbrooks johnson  chester himes the heats on putnams and sons new york  tells of the havoc that a misplaced cache of heroin in harlem can cause to do this he uses addicttypes with their full complement of supportive characters sometimes these characters come off and sometimes they dont but himes does manage to keep an element of suspense in the story right up to the very last page he is extremely successful in his attempts at humor this is perhaps the very strong point of the book humor is generally a visual experience and to elicit the kind of humorous response he gets from his use of the printed word demonstrates truly a marvelous talent unfortunately that talent does not obliterate the shortcomings in things such as dialogue and feel the reader is left with the feeling that mr himes would have been better off to have returned to harlem to restudy some of the patterns and vernacular that now are in vogue rather than depending on his memory for things about harlem that were true before he left there for residence in paris harlem is elusive because it is constantly changing and to capture even a minute part one must have uptodate firsthand contact it is easy to discover the fact that mr himes is a talented writer but it is equally apparent that the talent was not uniformly applied in places and things that required extensive hard work we find the author apparently settling for less than his native abilities could produce perhaps if harlem were not so well known to us the book would have been more palatable and believable but the harlem of mr himes does not come off with the reality we have seen in person and read about in the works of some others who strangely enough did not generally appear to have the basic talent that mr himes possesses in his book mr himes fails twice he fails himself and what he is no doubt capable of and he fails harlembrooks johnson

comedians may jest politicians may orate and harried taxpayers may fumebut income taxes are a necessary part of our economic structure income taxes were first imposed in  as an emergency measure to meet the expenditures of the civil war repealed in  and revived in  income taxes left the american scene when declared unconstitutional in  the sixteenth amendment to the constitution enacted into law on february   gave congress the power to levy and collect taxes on income from all sources without equal apportionment between the states or apportionment based on any census considered a model among tax systems the american tax system has a reputation of being one of the most effective and strongest systems anywhere in the world what is quite unique in our system is that almost  billion is collected each year with approximately  being collected on a voluntary basis this is the result of the selfassessment system whereby taxpayers in good faith assess themsplves by listing income and deductions and compute tax liability many taxpayers are resentful of the taxbite but by and large people are cognizant of the fact that most countriesboth of the eastern and western blocshave income taxes at higher rates than our own to complain to disagree to petition and to want taxes abolished altogether are an american institution what these antitax proponents know deep down in their hearts is that our system of government could not continue without the revenue derived from income and excise taxes inequities exist in anything human and congressional tax experts are aware that our tax laws are replete with loopholes and opportunities for special interests to pay less than their true share of the tax burden however studies by tax counsellors who work for the nations lawmakers are constantly underway the introduction of electronic data processing is expected to curb the deliberate omissions of taxable dividends interest and other items and to keep a check on dependency exemptions and allowable deductions at times it may not seem to be a privilege to pay taxes without waving the flag realization is a must that the annual federal tax bill is but a small price to pay to be able to live in a nation which has a constitution which embodies so many protections for the rights of its citizens while the treasury department through the internal revenue service wants you to pay your true and full tax liability it does not want you to overpay many taxpayers overpay their taxesunnecessarily or fail to receive refunds for previous overpayments because of faulty penmanship beware of deceiving digits consider the errors that can occur in computing your tax or filling in your forms if your ls s and s all look alike if your s and s appear to be interchangeable if your s and s cannot be told apart illegible numerals are not the only troublemakers each year hundreds of thousands of tax refunds are delayed in reaching claimants because internal revenue clerks cannot decipher names of individuals streets or cities failure to notify the district directors office of a change of address also results in delayed checks and unnecessary correspondence because by law the post office department cannot forward an envelope containing a government check you can save yourself a lot of grief if you approach the preparation of your tax return in an orderly fashion also tax time can be very costly if you neglect to keep a record of deductible expense and wait until the last minute to work on your return and in your haste overlook legitimate deductions on one sheet of paper list the figures from your w forms together with all other sources of income such as fees commissions profits from real estate profits from stocks dividends interest etc make sure that you do not include nontaxable income such as loans gifts compensation insurance proceeds insurance recoveries for injury or sickness etc on another piece of paper list your tax deductible expensescontributions interest casualty losses taxes medical expenses and miscellaneous items now it is time to make a decision which return should you use which method of filing will give you the lower tax to pay or the greater refund if your gross income is  or less you can elect to use the tax tables even though you make this election you can still deduct local carfares travel away from home expenses including the cost of meals and lodging which are necessary to your employment when your deductible expenses exceed  of your gross income it will pay you to make the election to itemize your deductions on what is known as the longform where your income is over  you can elect the standard optional deduction  limited to  you can list your itemized deductions for taxes interest charity etc or you can elect to use the minimum standard deduction frequently taxpayers will see published tables of average deductions and assume that their returns will not be questioned if what they claim is within the guidelines nothing could be more erroneous a taxpayer can only deduct that amount actually spent which is substantiated by receipted bills or cancelled checks the first draft of the return should be put away for a few days thereafter the return in draft form should be examined for omissions of income or deductible items the return should be checked for mathematical accuracy a clean handwritten or typed copy should be prepared for submission to the treasury department to this copy should be attached copy b of form w together with all schedules necessary to support deductions claimed on the return tax laws are complicated and often beyond the comprehension of the layman knowing this phony tax experts open up shops in candy stores barber shops poolrooms gas stations vacant stores etc during tax time each year some yearend tax preparers are fully capable while many others are either ignorant of the tax laws or are downright crooked several years ago a new york city newspaper tested the accuracy of these flybynight establishments and sent reporters with a set of hypothetical figures to five different taxseason experts the result was five different sets of answers yet despite warnings each year from governmental authorities and professional groups countless persons fall prey to these phony tax consultants usually the lure is that theyll get you a refund maybe so but you the taxpayer must pay the piper if your figures for deductions which you can actually substantiate are doctored and stretched in order to get you the refund the internal revenue service recently issued information concerning the arrest and conviction of rings which consisted of these illicit operators and internal revenue service personnel one a pennsylvanian asked his clients to sign blank returns and to make their tax payment check to his order he then falsely increased deductions and paid a reduced tax and pocketed the difference in addition to a yearandaday prison sentence he was placed on probation for three years during which time he cannot prepare any returns other than his own a parttime salesman convinced many persons that the w form was the full tax return he then prepared false returns containing exaggerated deductions and listed nonexistent dependents signed the return himself and after receiving the refund checks forged the endorsements and pocketed the refunds still another induced his customers to sign forms authorizing the government to mail the refund checks to his order unaware of the actual amount of their refunds as they never saw the copy filed with the revenue service the taxpayers accepted the amounts tendered while the tax consultant pocketed the difference under existing laws and regulations a taxpayer is responsible for the accuracy of his tax return and can face both civil and criminal penalties for the filing of a false return how can you protect yourself against this racket in any part of the country you can find a qualified lawyer or accountant who regularly does tax work what you have to keep in mind is that anyone who wants to can under existing law designate himself as a tax expert it is a safe guess that there is at least one crooked expertand probably morein every community and he can get as many as a thousand innocent taxpayers into serious trouble with the government so watch out the internal revenue service has recently issued a list of suggestions 
to taxpayers who are seeking assistance in the preparation of their returns  be sure of the competence and integrity of a prospective tax advisor consult the better business bureau or similar organization if no other references are available  be sure the tax advisor has a permanent place of business where he can be reached in case the internal revenue service subsequently questions data on the return  except where absolutely necessary do not sign a powerofattorney form always insist that refund checks come to you not the consultant  never sign a blank return you are fully responsible for everything appearing on your return  beware of those whose stock in trade is their claim of ability to obtain large refunds be especially careful of those who ask for a fee based on the amount to be refunded  steer clear of any advisor who suggests claiming dependencies or other deductions to which you are not entitled participation in such a scheme may result in serious criminal and civil penalties  cooperate with the government by reporting any suspicious actions by practitioners or any evidence of unethical or fraudulent practices your information will be held in confidence to these we might add the following a insist that your advisor be a licensed lawyer licensed accountant or person who is enrolled to practice before the treasury department lawyers and cpas are automatically enrolled others have to pass a rigid test to see if they know the tax law b examine your return before signing it make sure no incorrect items are listed accidentally or otherwise c when you owe money insist on making your check payable to the district director of internal revenue or to the internal revenue service mail your return yourself d be very cautious with advisors who claim that they can save you money in comparison with what you have paid in the past perhaps the best advice you can get in connection with your yearend tax problem is to stop looking for bargains a competent tax advisor will usually charge a fee based on the complexity of the return or the amount of detail involved but the fee if larger than that charged by the flybynight operator will be in line with that charged by other ethical professional tax men every return filed is checked for mathematical accuracy by a comptometer operator thereafter trained auditors scan each return for items of obvious error and for items of unusual nature you may receive tentative approval or you may receive a letter directing you to appear at the local office of the district director with proof of certain items claimed on your return your first thought when receiving a communication is why me the treasury department takes a second look at returns which contain large or unusual deductions where claim is made for large refunds where items are not fully explained where abnormally large deductions are claimed in relation to income all returns which have gross income of a certain figure are checked all business returns of a certain gross sales volume are checked the limits set each year by high officials in the treasury department these figures are not released to the public and are circulated to internal revenue service personnel only the treasury department has many sources of information available to it to ascertain that you are reporting all sources of taxable income your employer is required to file form w showing any wages paid to you any person firm or organization paying you  or more in compensation fees commissions rents etc is required to forward such information on form  any payor of dividends or interest of  or more is also required to report such payments on form  banks are required to report any unusual currency transactions in your account treasury agents keep a close check on county clerk offices to observe purchases of real estate they keep a close watch at race tracks and other places where large amounts of cash are spent they read divorce proceedings and separation suits where financial data is exposed they read newspaper accounts of robberies involving cash and jewelry a constant check is kept on prizes and awards given on television programs and in nationwide contests or sweepstakes no doubt youve read about adp automatic data processing is being used by the government to establish a history of each taxpayer on magnetic tape reports of dividend interest and other payments will be fed into the input and made part of the individual history comparison will be made with the return as filed and electronically the machine will punch out cards to alert the treasury department to failures to report taxable income another source of information is the informer our government checks letters sent to it by persons bearing a grudge who reveal information about taxpayers a jilted girl friend a jealous neighbor a disgruntled exemployee a dissatisfied present employee are but a few sources of squeal information to encourage this practice the government pays awards to informers based on the amount of the tax and penalty recovered and the amount of help received in the information furnished many congressmen are disenchanted with any system which encourages one person to spy on another and attempts have been made and at this writing are being made to suspend the system of making payments to informers what do you do when you are called for examination if you had your return prepared by a taxattorney or by an accountant it is best to let him handle the audit professional tax practitioners are better equipped to handle this matter and are less apt to put their foot into their mouths as you might do when representing yourself should you have someone representing you it is the best policy to cooperate fully by revealing complete facts regarding the items shown on your return locate all supporting evidence cancelled checks receipts etc and give these to the person whom you picked to represent you a word of caution where you were foolish enough to have your return prepared by one of the phony operators discussed previously it is best to represent yourself or secure a competent person to assume the responsibility of conducting the audit representing yourself call at the office at the time designated or if you cant keep the appointment call in advance and ask for a change to a more suitable date how are you to act the first rule is not to be offensive remember that the examining officer or revenue agent is only doing his or her job let the agent do the talking and let him tell you exactly what items are being questioned where you are asked to produce proof of a deduction taken on the return show the receipted bill or cancelled checks and if the agent is not satisfied offer to get additional information keep in mind that the audit does not have to be completed in that one visit you can ask for and youll readily get an opportunity to produce substantiating evidence to support your claim deductions where you can prove most of your deduction but not to the last penny the agent will most likely give you the benefit of the doubt if you have been agreeable cooperative and in a position to prove most of your deductions by evidencenot by oral argument when the agent reveals that he has information of income which is not disclosed on your return and you omitted such income based on your honest belief that such item is not taxable income show what evidence you can that such omission is based on law not just a desire to avoid paying taxes the agent will probably have on his desk a copy of one of the private tax services such as prentice hall or commerce clearing house and hell be glad to check in these volumes if you give a quote or section number to support your argument each proposed disallowance of deduction that you claimed and each proposed addition to taxable income will be discussed with you before the agent writes his report where you agree to the changes he will write his report and ask you to sign a form  wherein you agree to the charges and waive your right to take the matter to the tax court where you subsequently find that you were wrong in signing such form you can sue in the federal district court or in the court of claims to recover the taxes you paid butsuppose you dont agree with the changes that the agent proposes then you dont have to sign anything you thank him for his courtesy and ask him to send you a notice of the proposed changes from this point on you are dueling with the government but you have many many powerful forces on your side before the treasury department can issue an assessment and force you to pay additional taxes when you indicate that you do not agree to the proposed changes the agent will send you a letter stating the proposed changes and will arrange a conference with his group chief at this conference you will be given an opportunity to discuss the findings and to dispute them and show why you think your return as filed was correct should you not reach an agreement at this conference you will receive a copy of the agents report together with what is known as the day letter this letter gives you three courses of action  you can execute form  which will be enclosed agreeing to the agents determinations and thus closing the case or  you can file a formal protest setting forth the pertinent facts why you think you are right this is filed with the district director of internal revenue the appeal is referred to the appellate division  you can ignore the day letter and wait for the government to send you what is known as a day letter which is a statutory notice when you file a formal protest after the receipt of the day letter another conference is arranged this time with conferees in the appellate division an informal atmosphere prevails at these conferences no stenographer is present and you or your designated agent are given the opportunity to offer either written or oral evidence to refute the agents contentions every attempt will be made to reach an agreement and not have the case reach an impasse where you cannot reach agreement and a closing form  is not executed you will receive the day letter which is statutory notice of the governments intention to issue an assessment against you the day letter will inform you that unless you decide to agree to the assessment as proposed you must make a petition to the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency if you dont petition the tax court you will lose by forfeit and the government can levy its assessment but if you do ask the tax court to docket your case for a hearing the government cannot collect or levy an assessment except in very unusual cases where there is reason to believe that collection would be endangered by delay all during the period of waiting for your case to be heard by the tax court the opportunity is given you to settle your case conferences are granted to iron out differences of opinion and to effect compromises at the hearing before the tax court every avenue of justice is available to the taxpayer the court may decide for either the taxpayer or for the government or may decide that the issue is one that just requires a recomputation of tax liability after defining some points in either sides favor where a taxpayer loses a case in the tax court he may post a bond to cover the amount of the tax and take the case to the court of appeals and even to the u s supreme court this is one very unfortunate situation with relation to tax court decisions you might have a case which is exactly like another one to the last dotted i yet the same issue will be brought up by the government in an audit of your return this is because the commissioner of internal revenue can acquiesce or not acquiesce to any given decision if the commissioner does not acquiesce in an adverse decision each taxpayer must argue the same issue many congressmen are alarmed over this situation and have proposed that the commissioner in the event of a nonacquiescence must take the case on appeal to a higher court so that the issue is resolved one way or the other the same situation prevails in the event that you elected to bypass the tax court in this event you would have had to pay the tax deficiency and sue for a refund if the district director did not honor your claim for a refund presented on form  again you have an opportunity for conferences before the case is tried in the court of claims or in the district court appeals from both can be made to the u s supreme court the trouble with district court cases is that the same issue can be settled with different results in different districts the district courts are free to ignore decisions of other districts here again congressmen are trying to convince the commissioner that where different decisions are given to a similar set of facts in different districts that the case be taken on appeal automatically to the u s supreme court for final

i never will forget that day in early september about dusk when dick came home from work on aubrey bradleys farm raving about tea ice we hired outdick and me to the farmers around in our vicinity of the hocking valley whenever we could get a days work the week before we had worked every day for jim chevaliar the harelip township trustee putting up loose hay aubrey bradley baled his hay it sure was heavier that way when he used the little baler those bundles came out weighing about sixty or seventy pounds when he used the new baling machine they weighed ninety or a hundred that was almost moren i weighed i was getting ready to graduate from high school next term and ever since id been there i had tried everything i could think of to get the scales up past a hundredun twenty i guess thats why aubrey bradley asked for dick to come to work that early monday morning in september when he drove out to our house and stopped so fast the dust and gravel caught up with his red pickup truck when he skidded to a fishtail halt in the winter a farmer could take his time but in the summer he had to hustle to make hay while the sun shined not only is farming fast work but its back breaking which as i said is why aubrey bradley hired dick that morning and not me dick was sixteen a year youngern me but he was twice as sturdy and he was as strong as a young white oak tree i was more like a softwood maple i would hold together but a topheavy load could send me sagging before that summer  before jim chevaliar hired dick and me to set fence posts and then to put up hay when the haying season cameneither of us had learned much about farming our family owned one of the largest pieces of land in that part of the valley one hundred acres but it was all grown over with underbrush grandpa had never really intended to farm it when he bought it oh he said he wanted the boys my unclesto farm it and he even bought a couple of horses and a cow but hehimselfwas not a farmer he was a city factory worker who moved to the country to have room for his family his sonsmy unclesfollowed in his footsteps they tried to farm at first but somehow everyone else was always harvesting by the time the boys finished plowing the rolling west thirty acres beside the house by the time dick and i became farming ageother boys we went to school with started when they were about eight or tenour family had given up all pretenses of ever becoming farmers my uncles had even tom away half of the front of the barn so they could get their cars inside to work on them away from the snow by the time i reached high school grandpa had died my uncles had gone off to columbus or akron looking for work and ma had sort of inherited the running of the farm starting at seventeen working
for harelipped township trustee jim chevaliar i found farming a very difficult task half the time i had to guess what jim chevaliar wanted his words always came out in a wheezy raspy whisper covered all over with a shower of spit i never made fun though like the kids at school used to do i had been taught better than that i just tried to guess what he wanted and then do it maybe thats why he hired dick and me in the first place certainly there were lots of other boys around who knew more about farming i was glad to be making a little money but i wasnt always sure farming was the best way especially when the hay got stacked so high on the wagon that i couldnt throw a pitchfork full all the way to the top and it came tumbling back down on me to stick to my sweat or even worse when it came time to put it away in the hayloft hades itself surely can be no drier or hotter than the position furthest back in a hayloft in late afternoon right under the sunbaked tin roof where nary a breeze ever stirred and the chaff dinged to your sweaty skin like short prickly leeches i never thought i would live to crawl out of that hole into the air again but when i did and jim chevaliar took us home long after suppertime there was a certain innerglowing satisfaction at knowing that i had earned five more dollars i knew my five dollars never amounted up very fast but i pulled the little wad out of my watch pocket every night and shook out the chaff when i fell exhausted across my bed overlooking the ribbonlike dirt road i wondered how many mornings jim chevaliar would drive up that road or how many more mornings id be able to drag my aching bones out of bed to meet him finally come saturday the last of jim chevaliars hay was stored in the hotbox of a bam loft and dick and me began to wonder how we would spend our money we knew it would be for school clothes probably a pair of levis i needed a pair of shoes the only ones i had now had one sole flapping theyd already been half soled and they would have made it through the winter if i hadnt had to wear them in the hay field or maybe id buy some new shirts or socks it didnt matter i only wished there was more money so i could buy all my school things myself dick and me were just lying there in the yard under the maple tree nursing our aching muscles and looking at the montgomery ward catalogue trying to decide between all the things to buy and wishing we had more money when here come aubrey bradleys red pickup truck kicking gravel and dust for half a mile jim chevaliar never drove his old blue chevrolet pickup like that but then jim chevaliar was an old man never in a hurry for anything even when the hay was already
cut and the sky darkened with rain clouds he just plodded on and somehow we always managed to be sitting in the swing on his front porch drinking ice water by the time the rains came but with aubrey bradleyhe was a young farmer maybe just in his early fortieseverything had to be done right now why dick hardly had time to tell anyone where he was goingnot that there was anyone much else than me to tell since ma was at work in town and we didnt fancy reporting to the girlsbefore he was sitting up on the back of that pickup holding on for dear life and looking for the world like he was afraid the dust and gravel was going to catch up with him at any moment i just kept on looking at the montgomery ward catalogue and wondering what dick would buy with his extra money i wondered how much more money he would have than i had since wed never worked for aubrey bradley before i didnt know if he paid bettern the fifty cents an hour that jim chevaliar paid or even if he paid that good he certainly looked more prosperous with his fine big white house sitting in the middle of those sloping hills right on the highway wed always wondered how much land he owned beyond the hill and out of sight i guess there had always been a lot of things we wondered about aubrey bradleys farm with its great herd of hereford id always fancied myself a beef cattle man too ever since i studied agriculture in the ninth grade course a hereford steer was out of the question as a class project so i planted a quarter acre of potatoes we would have done that anyway to get us through the winter as soon as i could i quit the ag class but i still admired aubrey bradleys herd of whitefaced herefords aubrey bradleys oldest daughter norma jean was in dicks class and she never acted like her family was anything special but howie willet who had worked on the farm since he was in the third grade and learned to drive tractors and trucks there was in dicks room too and howie always acted like he was something real special aubrey bradleys man not just a hired hand by the summer when aubrey hired dick howie was practically like a foreman so there were all kind of things i wanted to know about aubrey bradleys farm when dick got home that night was it harder working in baled hay than loose hay was howie willet really as important as he pretended and was the bradley house really as nice as it looked from the highway hidden behind that white picket fence imagine how put out i was when dick came home talking about ice tea he was raving about ice tea mrs bradley served it with the midday meal and it tastes like nothing you ever drunk before dick marveled
he did arouse my curiosity some it wasnt like id never heard of ice tea before i had the rich folks ma worked for in town served it all the time i saw them drinking it once when they hired me on saturday to mow the lawn but i had to confess id never drunk any the only time we had any ice in our house was when ma bought a fiftypound block or two twentyfive pound blocksor what was left of it after a twenty mile ride from townhome in the trunk of the car for the ice box if there had ever been any extra ice it would have been too dirty after it was wrapped in a burlap bag and set in a tub in the trunk of the car to be used for ice tea so i was seventeen years old and had never drunk ice tea you would have thought that was a cardinal sin the way dick carried on that night he came home from working for aubrey bradley he talked about ice tea so much at supper that he got on everybodys nerveseven mas it was only when the girls started making fun of a sixteenyearold boy carrying on so that he was shamed into silence one thing dick didnt like was being made fun of but as soon as we went to bed he started again trying to tell me just how it tasted i told him i probably wouldnt like it he knew  didnt eat anything new i reminded him how i got sick just trying to eat beets after that time he smacked his lips over them for so  long i think dick got a special kick out of telling me about something i didnt like he just kept on talking about beets boiled buttered cooked any kind of way after he found out i couldnt eat them almost anything but beans and taters tasted strange to me oh but youd love ice tea he exclaimed its so cold but not like water its kinda sweet and moren that its got a peculiar twangyflavor he went to sleep looking forward more to the next days glass of ice tea than the sixtyfive cents an hour aubrey bradley paid f xaubrey needed extra help the next day because he was right in the thick of the third baling he hired me when he came after dick working for aubrey bradley was a heap bettern working for jim chevaliar in one respect with baled hay there werent any scapegoats had to stand all the way back in the hayloft under a burning tin roof pitching for dear life at the hay cutting you off from your one air hole least ways at first i thought it was better working in baled hay it wasnt too bad at first when the bales were as thick as the morning dew and you hardly had to move out of your tracks to throw em on the wagon moving between the rows i felt kinda good to be working with dick again him on one side of the wagon and me on the other pitchin bales for hallelujah like a team although we never said it in words didnt have to those ole bales said it for us just as fast as his hitwhump mine landed with another whump all while the morning sun rose we marched through the field behind that tractor and wagon whump whump whump the bales hitting end to end on the first tier side by side on the second and then end to end again whump whump about the time the sun soaked up the last of the dew off the clover all those easy bales were gone then we had to stray further and further from the tractors path to pick up bales needless to say the quicker we got back with em the less distance we had to run with em to catch the tractor one thing about howie willet when he was driving tractor he didnt wait he went right down the row at his set speed and either you were there with the bale or you ran and caught him always made like he couldnt see you when the bales were piled so high but i suspected he hated to see aubrey so far ahead on the baler by the time the sun dried out the alfalfa stubble which made it jab like spears up through the flapping sole of my shoe the bales were stacked five tiers high higher than i could reach my whumps had lost their umph and the bales i flung landed with soft plops about half way up the pile and there i went racing after the tractor pushing the bale the rest of the way up then i had to run back and git what i missed by the time we pulled into the barnyard to unload the first load that loose hay of jim chevaliars never looked so good both dick and me were nursing hands with palms red and rutted from the wire binding that the new baler used course the string that the old baler bound the hay with could cut your skin a lot quicker if you made the mistake of letting it slide along your fingers so i held on to the bales for dear life and when the right time came flung for all i was worth when that wagonful was unloaded i fell back on the stack in the barn more wilted than a tomato plant in a drought without a support stake and i dont believe jim chevaliars hayloft ever made me any hotter my tongue was hanging worsen a hound dogs after a useless rabbit chase i couldnt even respond when norma jean came to the back porch and hollered out whether or not we wanted her to fix us something cold to drink luckily for me howie went after it though i dont know why he was hot from just riding on the tractor he was gone a good while and i was glad i just lay there on the bales of hay panting and peering at my red blistering palms thats when dick started again man i sure hope he comes back with some of that good ice tea he crooned i was so hot that even the salty sweat trinkling through the corners of my mouth tasted good a good tall glass of water with ice cubes tinkling against the sides would have hit the spot perfectly but if he came back with ice tea i would jump for iteven if i did have a thing about not liking anything new anything wet would have been good but dick kept harping about ice tea almost bragging the way he did about buttered beets i was just hot i didnt care about his ice tea all i wanted was something cold man you know aint nobody serves ice tea in the barn i snapped maybe it was my implication that he didnt know etiquette more than my rebuke that riled him but i could tell he was riled by the way he tensed his body and snapped his shoulders back proudly after that he didnt say anything he just sat there and stared at me with beady eyes set in a sweaty forehead for his sake i kinda hoped howie would come back with ice tea for my sake though i was glad to see a pitcher of ice water nothing tastes as good as cold water when youre roasting inside but before i could cool off my innards that darn fool howie jumped on the tractor again and yelled something about aubrey getting way ahead of us now if theres anything makes you feel worsen you do bringing in  a load its knowing that you got to start all over again and the hardest partthrowing hundredpound bales a mile highis just behind you and so fresh in your mind you cant even enjoy starting out at the bottom again the second load the one aubrey baled while we picked up yesterdays work was on a hillside dick looked at me with his stillbeady eyes and jumped off the wagon on the uphill side i didnt mind taking the downhill side where all the throwing was uphill because i was older just because dick was as straight and as strong as a young white oak tree and i was more like softwood maple was no reason to let himor howie who was in dicks class a grade behind me think i would slough off the hardest part besides id lived around dick long enough to know to stay out of his way when his eyes were beady our team work was broken up right away dick snatched bales of hay right and left and slammed them onto the wagonwhump whumpfwhump it was impossible for me to keep up with that pace throwing the bales uphill and all and with the spearing chaff penetrating my flapping shoe sole like i was barefooted and howie as soon as the bales were three or four tiers high couldnt see me anymore so he gauged his speed by dicks work on the uphill side and he kept chugging along faster and faster sweat and loose chaff ran in rivulets together under my tee shirt by dinner time i wondered just how in the world much work aubrey bradley expected for each sixtyfive cents the fact that it was the best wages i had ever earned was little consolation to my nowwelted hands and my right foot pricked through the flapping sole by so much chaff i was limping i would have quit with half a days pay but it was a good three miles home and i didnt think i could walk that far i sat atop the jogging towering stack of bales as we went in with the noon load and mulled over what i should do certainly i wouldnt do anything until after i ate dinner maybe by the time the dinner hour was over i would have found an easier way to load hay just another glass of ice water might shed an entirely different light on the matter the hot sun and the baling wire had taken some of the beady glisten out of dicks eyes too now youre gonna find out just how good ice tea tastes he half whispered high above the tractor drivers head i dunno id just as soon have a good glass of water i suggested you dont know wha chere talking about dick almost shouted then he boasted course you aint never tasted no ice tea before neither dick nor i was ever really sure whether or not he could hurt me if we really got mad as far back as when we were at lotteridge grade school dick was the only person i wouldnt put the boxing gloves on with at recess time and that included big ole bobby sampson in the class ahead of me and bullshouldered jay price i knew either of them could tear me apart anytime they wanted but sampson and jay were my best friends i knew they wouldnt hit me hard unless i hit hard first the one time i did forget myself and laid a straight left jab on sampson that swelled his eye i hurried and took off the gloves while the teacher and everyone looked at his bruise but i never would put the gloves on with dick even though somebody was always after us to go at it i guess i just never liked the idea of the only colored boys in school fighting each other we never discussed it but i was sure dick felt the same way everybody said i was scared of him everybody in school knew dick was stronger but both dick and i remembered the time i caught him around the neck and jerked him off that little russell boy who called dick a nigger i got scared he was going to kill the russell boy and i nearly choked dick to death ever since then dick never started a fight with me whenever he got mad he just kept goading trying to get me mad enough to forget myself and hit him or hed just sit real still and his eyes git real beady if he didnt feel like fighting thats the way he sat atop those bales of hay riding in for dinner where they would serve ice tea i couldnt be sure he was sulking because he looked away from me like he was surveying all aubrey bradleys meadows but he sat like that all the rest of the way across that bumpy field and i just figured it was because i had insulted him by suggesting i might not like ice tea anyway if he had been sulking on the wagon it left him as soon as we washed up and he saw those glasses of winecolored ice tea setting around the dinner table w i paid more attention to the fancy white table cloth and the curved glassfront china cabinet in the dining room and the fact that we were eating in the dining room and all of usdick and myself howie aubrey bradley mrs bradley and their two daughters it never dawned on me right then that in all that big fine white house hidden away from the highway behind the white picket fence that this was the only place for anybody to eat i just kept hoping i wouldnt get the white table cloth dirty or break the dishes dick just kept jabbing me in the ribs while aubrey bradley said the blessing and nodding toward the ice tea and grinning from ear to ear i just studied the silverware the way the knife and spoon rested on a napkin and the fork all by itself on the left side of the plate suddenly the bottom fell out of my stomach taking my appetite with it i didnt know anything about the kind of table manners that called for the knife and spoon on  one side of the plate and the fork on the other god what was i supposed to do i declined the peas when howie passed them i didnt like peas and i wasnt hungry any longer anyway by the time the potatoes got to me i figured i could watch carefully and do what everyone else did i was just settling down inside when howie passed the pork chops and kept the fork off the platter for a moment i faltered and nearly dropped the platter whats the matter boy we been working you so hard youre weak aubrey laughed i grinned my left hand edged toward my fork on the table but somehow that just didnt seem right getting the meat off the platter with the same fork i was going to eat with course we did it that way at home but we didnt have the knife and spoon on one side of the plate and the fork on the other quickly i passed the platter on to dick an act which i immediately regretted when mrs bradley remarked on the sparseness of my meal i passed it off with the explanation that im a beans and tater man cant get much work out of you this afternoon on what youre eating aubrey barked looking at the little bit of potatoes on my plate i was beginning to hope that ice tea was everything dick said it was the first few minutes at the table had restored my reason enough for me to know that i couldnt go home at noon i wanted the extra two dollars and sixty cents for a handcarved leather belt with a silver buckle i saw in the montgomery ward catalogue so i swallowed hard and figured id make it through the afternoon as best i could on the potatoes and a couple glasses of ice tea i watched dick gulp down half a glass of the brown liquid almost swallowing the ring of lemon and a big square ice cube in his haste then he dived into the pork chops potatoes and peas on his plate i looked at the ice tea again it must be good i told myself if he can drink it like that besides it was the last thing between me and all those hundred pound bales id throw before nightfall my stinging puffed hands almost fumbled the cool glass of nourishment just feeling all those wires wrapped around em the very coolness of the outside of the glass was refreshing and it strengthened me i lifted the muddybrown tea to my lips and closed my eyes the first cold drops parched my tongue like it was water and quickly i tipped the glass and poured down half the coldness halfway to somewhere my taste buds translated the coldness into bitter indescribable strangling fluid it came back up into the glass and onto the white table cloth chased by gasps and chokes i begged mrs bradleys pardon saying the tea had gone down my wind pipe and i reached for some water it was only then that i realized ice tea was the only drink on the table i smothered a few more coughs and sputters with potatoes when mrs bradley came around again with the tea pitcher i politely said no thank you maam 
x seemed io wynton   that his brother was in  a particularly black  mood for one thing it was hotwell over s  v    j a ninety againand after two weeks the muggy days had not ended for another the weekenders were even more worrisome than usual for the last two hours groups of them had been hanging around the cottage staring and asking questions it was especially hard on arnie because he never liked them in the first place if he answered at all it was usually something that made them stop suddenly look him up and down and stalk away well white people were like that it didnt pay to fool around with them mr raglin would probably say something about it when the day was over why dont you just take off wyn arnie said finally turning to wynton with nervous impatience go on take a swim i can handle these goons arnies face tensed as he spoke of the tourists for a while anyway he added darkly then turned and again leaned over the big freezer his white tshirt was wet at the armpits and beads of sweat dropped from the tip of his nose into the salted ice i aint tired wynton said perkily trying to show in his voice he really meant it anyway its only a couple more hours when the next boat gets back we can both    wynton cut himself off for arnie had stopped churning the machine and was staring testily at the floor wynton knew he wanted to be alone maybe he said tentatively after a pause i could just run on over to the broadside and see about that ice we hardly got enough to   to hell with the ice arnie said raising his voice i mean just forget about the ice you wasnt born to drag ice around here in the hot sun now stop botherin me hear just go on down to the beach and ill be along  in a couple of hours arnie had tried to soften his voice for he did not often swear at wynton but it was too late and the younger boy glanced dejectedly at the back of his brothers head then left the cottage without a word outside was like an inferno it was the hottest part of the day the sun beat down on the patches of grass and the blazing white cottages with an intensity you could almost see could almost hear the maryland countryside rose and lowered in the distance and beyond the lake where the hills met the sky the faraway trees seemed to simmer in the heat wynton swallowed hard and tried to shake off his brothers words arnie was all right when he wasnt mad but lately he had been getting madder and madder a little madder every weekend wynton did not always understand him maybe it would be better that night when the work was done wynton breathed heavily through his mouth and continued along the narrow dirt path that led from the cottage area to the lake off in the distance the long white beach glared like a luminous band and he could hardly wait to plunge headlong into the water and let the lazy warm waves swallow up his body it seemed to be deserted most of the guests had taken the cruise to storey point or were lounging around the cottages where the shade trees were wynton could make out an abandoned rowboat and nearby a colony of those funny strutting little birds with the spearshaped bills that had been hanging around all week they looked so funny wynton had given them a name fussy grannies because they were so much like old people he named all the animals he saw the cottontails were dancers foxes were sneaky boys and squirrels were jello because they were so fidgety and shook all the time even at half a mile wynton could hear the grannies talking among themselves and fussing it was like each of them were constantly answering the other full of conviction like old people thats right thats right right
wynton loved it along the lake in the summertime he loved the water and the beach and the dark woods where he and arnie rode horseback in the heat of the day he loved sitting at night at the edge of the lake tossing firecrackers into the blackness hearing them pop just before they struck the water sometimes arnie took him along to the broadside where they sat in the corner away from the crowd while arnie drank beer that was mostly on thursdays just before the weekend after that things changed pretty much mr raglin had to smile all the time around the tourists and that made him all the meaner around arnie mr raglin ran the ice cream house where the weekenders sat and talked when the sun was hot along with rev sharkey he was trying to make a man of arnie who had dropped out of college and was talking about joining the merchant marines dont throw it up just yet rev sharkey would say glancing at arnie in his nervous way the world hasnt failed yougive it a chance what kind of example will you be to your brother and such a young man but arnie was a loner and didnt much trust thingsor people not even rev sharkey not a lot anyway wynton reached the edge of the beach and felt the hot sand burn his feet not a whiff of wind was stirring and out across the lake the water was dead still like glass he was just about to climb out of  his shirt when suddenly he froze somewhere on the beach a woman was laughing the sound like from another world caused wyntons heart to leap and he glanced quickly around the desolate beach at last he saw themwhat looked like half a dozen people clustered around an umbrella down at the far end somebody a woman had stood up now and was walking back and forth along the edge of the water from the distance she seemed to be dancing now wynton could hear the unison sound of hands being clapped and all at once a peel of laughter highpitched drunken the tourists were a strange lot they did such peculiar things from the city they came carloadsfull to lie upon the beach they lived in big white cottages along the highway and held loud parties far into the night daytimes you could find them at the ice cream house grinning nervously and asking all sorts of silly questions wynton did not always understand the world sometimes he agreed with arnie that it was all just a dream full of meaningless people doing meaningless things they seem real enough arnie always said but when you investigate try to touch them theres no one there its kind of scary wynton wynton was about to turn away when the dancing woman lifted her hand and seemed to call him she stood widelegged at the edge of the water waving back and forth and now and then he caught snatches of her voice wynton was a little afraid of the tourists they were all right he figured but you couldnt always tell reluctantly he buttoned his shirt and hurried down toward the umbrella wishing he had thought to wear his shoes when he arrived the tourists six of them three men and three womenwere sprawled across the sand one of them was mr cain who lived in washington but owned a guest house up the road the woman who had called him lay on her back a strange grin on her face youre the kid from the ice cream house arent you yes mam we were wondering if you could get us one of those boats well pay she didnt look exactly at him more at the top of his head her eyes laughing leave the boy alone ethel one of the men grunted lazily if the boats were for rent thered be somebody over there he was old and wrinkled like mr cain and the other man all the women were young shut up hal she replied and giggled im making time with the kid whats your name sonny wynton mam answered wynton feeling a tremor pass through his body why had he come he thought suddenly why hadnt he looked away pretended not to see them the smell of whiskey was everywhere these were the people who had come in last night well wynton youre just the cutest little thing but i saw you spying on me a minute ago anyway hows the fishing around here its  all right i guess wynton stammered if you want a  ill go and ask    thats all right son said the wrinkled man brushing a fly from his forehead nobody here wants a boat the dancing woman sniggled againthis time kind of different and glanced out across the beach hal brought his own amusement she said at last thats how it is with these elderly bastards dont swear around the kid ethel the wrinkled man said but he didnt seem to much care the fly had returned and was giving him trouble what i mean the woman went on again studying the top of wyntons head is that this here is mr shulan hes a united states congressman very important youve been reading about him im sure you study the government in school no mam wynton said uncomfortably glancing nervously at his feet he had tried to give the answer a kind of finality maybe now they would let him go of course he doesnt study any government interrupted another woman who looked exactly like the first that is they both wore skimpy bathing suits and plucked their eyebrows like in the movies they both looked like marilyn monroe thats in the high schools for cryin out loud well he oughta be studying it said ethel teach him about the democratic process about the wonderful job hal js doing there was a loud sniggle just then but wynton did not look up when finally he managed to raise his eyes it was only to gaze nervously out across the lake from the direction of the boathouse a faint breeze made ripples in the water and far away the trees on jacksons island swayed gently back and forth wynton remembered the time he had swum all the way across and then back again and hadnt told anybody arnie would have thrashed him then he shifted his weight awkwardly from one foot to the other as if to break the spell the quiet day suddenly exploded with sound the earsplitting foghorn honked twice and then was silent captain adams old excursion boat was making its sluggish way toward the boathouse a trail of churning water followed its slow course along the lake and tourists stood on both decks staring silently at the shore the explorers are back ethel said tiredly slapping loudly at her  thigh have your last cocktail children god what a weekend mr shulan took a long swallow from a flask he had been holding on his lap and placed it carefully underneath one of the blankets we should have gone to the peninsula like i said no offense cain its been great ethel giggled again theres a platform at the peninsula and hal could do his stuff everybody laughed andrew jackson shulan the third man said the new savior from the west its a commodity said mr cain he does it very well the congressman remained silent seeming bored he crossed his hairy legs on the blanket and stared listlessly at the lake wynton saw his chance and took it excuse me miss he stammered pointing to the boat and without waiting for a reply took off across the sand toward the boathouse he ran quickly not daring to look back funny people he thought at last reaching the edge of the water and letting his feet wade in the shallow warm surf kind of scary though wynton had never met a congressman they ran the country miss stevenson saidcongressmen and senators and the president they were the spirit of america and every kid should want to be one but arnie wasnt like that and wynton loved his brother and wanted to be like him life was so awfully strange sometimes you didnt always know what was what for at the same time wynton did want to be a congressman or maybe the president and amie they all said would never amount to anything at the boathouse the passengers were already filing down the wobbly ramp observing them wynton lost all thoughts of the congressman and of arnie they were so funny the tourists for all his shyness wynton loved to observe them watch them do their funny things like lying halfnaked in the blazing sun or stomping around in the woods in their short pants or funniest of all shaking their bodies on the dance floor over at the broadside arnie called them a plague but wynton enjoyed them from a distance there was something a little strange about the tourists like most white people they smiled a lot but you couldnt always tell after the boat was empty captain adams said there was no sweeping to do so wynton followed the last of the passengers from the boathouse and down the narrow beach the crowd fanned out along the sand looking like hundreds and hundreds of strange and funny birds already some had entered the lake and the day rang with splashing water the squeals of excited women more umbrellas in strange lively colors burst open along the beach and gay expensivelooking blankets dotted the sand wynton ran wildly along the beach feeling fresh and happy in spite of the heat when the weekenders came it was like a carnival full of colors and the music of a hundred transistors all playing at once noise followed them everywhere on the beach at the ice cream house in the big white cottages where they held their latenight parties americans ruled the world miss stevenson once said because they had more energy like honey bees to wynton they were more like flies nervous and jittery with nothing to do america was the greatest nation in the world she liked to say but arnie who had worked last summer in haiti didnt agree we dont know what a nation is he had shouted to wynton one night as they sat at the edge of the lake a nation wyn is a kind of tribea large family you might saywith millions and millions of brothers and sisters nephews cousins they eat the same food speak the same language they even look something alike they are one people and to defend that principle every man woman and child stands ready to die thats what a nation is wynan identity a pride americans dont understand that well whatever it was wynton wanted to be a leader a congressman perhaps and be a credit to his country thinking it over he found a deserted spot near the trees and lay his head down in the sand musedly watching a small rowboat filled with shouting people a little ways out from the shore wynton must have fallen asleep for all of a sudden he lay wide awake upon the sand knowing something horrible had happened on the beach about a dozen yards away at the edge of the lake a large group of people had gathered round mr shulan and someone was handing him a pistol get those kids back someone shouted and suddenly a woman screamed  his heart pounding wynton  leaped madly from the ground and hurried down to the shore fearing what he might see but no more able to turn back than had he been drawn by a magnet the tourists had formed a tight little knot near the lake and had fallen strangely silent staring excitedly into the water something very wrong had happened to the day and overhead the scattered clouds hung motionless in the sky a scrawny old woman in a pink bathing suit the blue veins showing in her legs made an ugly face showing her teeth and a groaning sound deep in her chest a man nearby grabbed his little boy and held him high in the air to see after a long while wynton at last saw it about thirty feet out what looked like half its body protruded from the water and only a brief flicker of its tongue let you know it was a live thing and not some tree limb some large twig washed in from the deep mocassin one of the men said straight from hell get those people back wynton stared at the treelimb  object silent and still in the trem  bling water and felt a strange fear all his life he had seen them a hundred times slithering from the water in the still of the day going silently easily to their secret places the lake area was full of them so the old people said wynton called them old grey because thats how they werecool and damp and mysterious often he would discover one in the road its long body flattened by a car and pick it up and fling it into the weeds sometimes he kept it stripping its skin and tying it to the light string in his room at mr raglins some of the kids made belts he had never before feared old grey but this one seemed different with the crowd all around wynton looked at the congressman who was doing something to the pistol and then out at the mute motionless object in the water and breathed silently it could have crossed the lake he figured and gone in at the island or farther down the beach but that was old grey he didnt have much of a brain except for getting food he didnt know about tourists and children and safety precautions and things he lived in his own little world a slow secret place where people didnt go now he was trapped unable to stay in the water and blocked from getting on the beach but he didnt seem to panic in spite of all the people snakes were mostly like that wynton was staring regretfully at the water when suddenly it happened he would remember it for years to come one of those brief experiences unknown to adults that so powerfully affect a young child reality for a brief moment seems to run amok all the familiar things are there but somehow disjointed and horrible like a nightmare the congressman had raised the pistol above his head and was waving it gaily back and forth the gesture sure practiced reminded wynton of the ringmaster he had once seen and feared when the great circus came to town let im have it shulan a man shouted the filthy communist as if answering the command the congressman a wrinkled old man with trembling hands turned abruptly and without aiming fired twice at the snake both shots missed skipping out across the lake and making little splashes in the glassy water again he fired then again and again his pale old body jerking with each report so out of place there on the beach he was faintly terrifying somehow one of the bullets struck the mocassin twitched violently seemed to linger in the faltering day then sank lazily into the lake the murky water swallowed up its body and turned a dull red wynton was terrorstricken the scene in its senseless violence was like the tribal ceremonies you saw in the movies the crowd had gathered around the congressman and were taking his picture others rushed to the lake gazing intently at the bloody water wynton could smell their bodies the tanning lotion they used on their skin these were the americansthat great grinning people who had captured the world without realizing it wynton found himself running breathlessly across the sand headed nowhere but needing suddenly to erase it all he raced along the edge of the lake hoping the lazy ripple would somehow drown out the sound of the cheering he thought of miss stevenson his proper little schoolteacher it was funny how people lied and sometimes they didnt know that they lied arriving at the boathouse he dropped heavily onto the ground and lay trembling on the sand he remained for a long time catching his breath the sun had begun to get lower in the sky and suddenly a cool breeze from across the lake bathed his moist body around him he heard the country soundsa bird call the bark of a dogas evening descended over the lake it was getting on toward four oclock he remembered suddenly and arnie would be along soon and the thought of arnie was like awakening from a nightmare wynton lay motionless and silent at the edge of the lake waiting for his brother 
back in antiquity there was a saying that is still very much with us today the saying is render unto caesar that which is caesars and render unto god that which is gods this was a tacit assumption of that fact that there was to be a split between the secular and spiritual realms politicians were to minister to the secular realm and churchmen to the spiritual realm even then there were great conflicts between politician and pope the two swords doctrine manifested in the above quote which was a source of conflict down through the ages still lingers with us of late it is demonstrated in the conflict that goes on within the minds and souls of religious leaders today in the area of civil_rights just how much should a clergyman concern himself with the secular movement of negroes into the street to protest how involved should be get in the basic mundane struggle of black people to leave the ghetto and throw off their ghettorization for negro ministers this has often proven to be a thorny question with no fast and sure answer for many white ministers it has proven to be a question that they have refused to meet head on and have attempted to ignore it whenever and wherever possible but there is a discernible change in their reaction to the civil_rights movements more and more white ministers are coming to the front lines some assuming roles of leaders but david reimers white protestantism and the negro oxford university press  is not so much concerned with what the various white christian leaders are doing but rather    my purpose is to provide the historical perspective for viewing    what they are doing it is perhaps too shopworn to repeat that the most segregated hour in america is sunday morning from eleven to twelve when america is worshipping this is a very provocative and pitiful paradox mr reimers book does help to understand how this blightful fact got to be such understanding the background does not of course cure the ailment but it does provide us with a basis for making intelligent diagnosis and the ultimate application of preventive measures to this end mr reimers book furnishes us with a valuable piece of literature it is perhaps necessarily incomplete because this is not the kind of subject that lends itself to a definitive treatment it is easy and intelligible reading and will give the reader certain historical insights into whys and hows of american white christianity and its relationship to american black people this is what the author sets out to do and after some  pages you get the impression that he has succeeded
the awakenings of africa are numerous and many are lost with that part of history that is conveniently listed as unrecorded it is refreshing to read a book that makes an admirable attempt at recording parts of the more recent political awakening of africa rupert emerson and martin kilson have coedited an interesting book entitled the political awakening of africa prenticehall new jersey  the method of chronicling this more recent awakening is to collect the speeches of some of africas leading nationalists and leaders starting back with j e casely hayford and felix eboue and their special brand of nationalism and continuing down to more current leaders and their brand of african political nationalism the book is outstanding for what is included and the light that it sheds on the basic thinking of african leaders some years ago the book points to the former african desire to better conditions within the existing framework of political domination by for eign powers the goal of these early leaders was to convince the ruling powers that the african was worthy of better treatment on one hand and to make the african more deserving and faithful to the colonial country on the other as stated above the book is impressive for what it says but it is also impressive because it does not say as much as one would like hearing the leaders of africa past and present talk about african political problems is a very enlightening and realistic method of understanding what the african thinking and goals really were and the methodology they sought to employ to realize these ends the amount of literary and intellectual salt the reader has to apply to get a full understanding is correspondingly reduced when the subject matter is presented in this fashion the upshot of all this is that one is impressed with what is said and how but really wishes that the authors had given us more while the old theatre axiom always leaving wanting more is good theatre technique the result of the same feeling here is that the reader is left partially pleased but generally frustratedbrooks johnson  chester himes the heats on putnams and sons new york  tells of the havoc that a misplaced cache of heroin in harlem can cause to do this he uses addicttypes with their full complement of supportive characters sometimes these characters come off and sometimes they dont but himes does manage to keep an element of suspense in the story right up to the very last page he is extremely successful in his attempts at humor this is perhaps the very strong point of the book humor is generally a visual experience and to elicit the kind of humorous response he gets from his use of the printed word demonstrates truly a marvelous talent unfortunately that talent does not obliterate the shortcomings in things such as dialogue and feel the reader is left with the feeling that mr himes would have been better off to have returned to harlem to restudy some of the patterns and vernacular that now are in vogue rather than depending on his memory for things about harlem that were true before he left there for residence in paris harlem is elusive because it is constantly changing and to capture even a minute part one must have uptodate firsthand contact it is easy to discover the fact that mr himes is a talented writer but it is equally apparent that the talent was not uniformly applied in places and things that required extensive hard work we find the author apparently settling for less than his native abilities could produce perhaps if harlem were not so well known to us the book would have been more palatable and believable but the harlem of mr himes does not come off with the reality we have seen in person and read about in the works of some others who strangely enough did not generally appear to have the basic talent that mr himes possesses in his book mr himes fails twice he fails himself and what he is no doubt capable of and he fails harlembrooks johnson
