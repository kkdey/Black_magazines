a people fighting for the opportunity to hold slaves forever who were more concerned about domination by the whites in all aspects of life than about justice who had hanged slaves indiscriminately on suspicion of intent to revolt who had surrendered to mob violence anyone suspected of antislavery such a people could not be expected to abide by the rules of war where people of color were concerned there were approximately  of these men in the union army including  infantry seven cavalry and  artillery regiments and  in the navy it is important to remember that they were of four origins free men from the northern states slaves from the conquered areas of the rebellion fugitive slaves and slaves from the loyal states who had joined the army with or without the consent of their masters louisiana kentucky and tennessee furnished nearly onethird of the total number the free men were citizens of their states and of the united states and some of them were veterans or sons or grandsons of veterans of the revolution and war of  the slaves from conquered areas were wards of the government known as contrabands under the confiscation acts the fugitive slaves were free after the emancipation proclamation both contrabands and fugitives were free by military force therefore by due process of law if their owners had been killed in armed resistance to the government that too was by due process of law these men of color had been caught between the fury of rebellious masters and the solid legions of loyal men they had died of disease neglect and hunger they had hidden in the canebrakes the swamps and the hills away from the passions of those who sought to drive them back to ruin they never were safe they never were free until courageous men like general hunter on the sea islands and butler in new orleans and thomas in the lower mississippi valley compelled rebels and prejudiced loyalists alike to respect them as men by putting rifles in their hands then their own courage put the seal of a great government upon their citizenship let us never forget that the condition of the fugitives who came in a great wave toward the union army was appalling if there were nothing else in the way of evidence the testimony of honorable men on that point would damn the institution of slavery completely the fugitives were broken in spirit some came alone some brought their families few had any sort of possessions their souls cried out against centuries of oppression they had been able to see but dimly beyond the limited horizon of the old plantation area they now came through the heart of a rugged and beautiful timberland where are the headwaters of rivers that flow to the sea where men learn the cruelty as well as the beauty of natural law where they feel the full force and meaning of life and must choose their own destiny here they discovered the overpowering majesty of the mountains the rustle of trees in the ancient forests the wild animals that roamed in the hinterlands for the first time many of them could stand erect and say i am a man their longings increased their horizons broadened but their fears deepened with every step they took for on every mountain path behind every tree in every shadow lurked death or cruel retribution their only hope was to reach the protection of the union armies the influx forced establishment of refugee camps around the perimeter of the battle area grant put the refugees to work harvesting cotton and used the profits to provide food medical care and clothing the army used them as laborers but it needed help and that help was not slow in coming christian benevolence had its roots down deep in america the men and women of the s who had dedicated their lives to organized benevolence had served well both their country and their god thousands now entered the portals which had been opened by the army into the vast arena of social reconstruction here was confusion and much work to be done and it was done by the combined efforts of the army and the benevolent societies with the blessing of the civil government they went straight to the heart of the problem there were  men women and children many of them aged infirm and sick they had to be cared for as rapidly as the narrowing limits of the rebellion released them their only present source of sustenance was charity their only hope over the long view was education so there came into being in the towns and on the plantations from which owners or workers or both had fled training schools for labor and for life hospitals and workshops the purpose was to enrich the nation spare it the burden of a permanent drain upon charity and alleviate the disastrous consequences of the rebellion it was the chaplains under the inspiring leadership of john eaton of the twentyseventh ohio infantry volunteers in grants army a native of new hampshire and former superintendent of schools in toledo who took over the job of education and it was the army officers and privates who performed a noble but unrecorded service on a man to man basis after  benevolent societies provided the money and the teachers for the schools the army furnished subsistence and transportation the benevolent societies furnished clothing books and other educational materials organizations most active in this work were the american missionary society the new england freedmans aid society of boston the freedmans relief association of new york the western sanitary commission of st louis the northwest freedmans aid commission of chicago and the western freedmans aid commission of cincinnati these organizations had in operation at the close of the war when the freedmans bureau was established by congress approximately  schools with  teachers and  pupils in schools and orphan asylums the work had been accomplished under difficulties almost insurmountable the white population in the entire area of occupation turned its energies to preventing a solution of the problem instead of helping only in nashville and st louis did they contribute to the support of the schools there were incessant raids by confederate cavalry particularly by wheeler and forrest and the farther freedmen were from the army the more difficult it was to maintain schools best results were achieved in the west in cities like vicksburg chattanooga and memphis and in the east in the seaports and coastal areas except for north carolina plantations were isolated plantation owners were a law unto themselvesnot much could be done in the way of learning when school hours had to be adjusted to a long day in the cotton field teachers were victims of hostility cruelty and disease many dying of yellow fever smallpox and plain lack of decent food and living quarters both teachers and pupils were abused subjected to acts of violence and kidnapped school buildings were defaced torn down and burned the attitude of men in rebellion toward all efforts to assist the transition of slaves to freedom and to aid in social reconstruction of the area was no different from their attitude toward people of color in uniform they used slaves everywhere in their labor battalions their war effort was based on slave labor they used some free persons of color in their enlisted units but in no case was there any promise of emancipation they considered all union men of color as in insurrection for which the penalty was death and all white officers of these men as guilty of inciting insurrection for which the penalty was death by the laws of all slave states governor john letcher of virginia demanded from general jackson the surrender of captured negro troops and their white officers to be tried under the same law as had been john brown general beauregard wanted to execute all abolition prisoners as he called them by the garrote everyone apparently spoke of a union uniform on a negro as an abolition uniform secretary of war seddon said with regard to the officers we ought never to be inconvenienced with such prisoners this was a general order of jefferson davis as early as november  supported by act of the confederate congress after lincolns emancipation proclamation on christmas eve  davis ordered all negro prisoners and officers turned over to the states the confederate congress changed the rules and may   ordered negro troops to be turned over to the states and the officers to be executed after trial by army tribunals it was not generally enforced because of certain retaliation by the lincoln administration there was substituted for the death penalty a refusal to include soldiers of color in prisoner exchange this led to a complete breakdown of the exchange system more importantly however the slaughtering of negro soldiers instead of taking them prisoners which had been going on from the beginning of the war was now intensified negro troops were not given the status of prisoners of war confederates murdered them at fort pillow in tennessee after they had surrendered they slipped in behind burnsides army and killed wagoners they killed them when union transports were captured on the cumberland river they bayoneted wounded men as they advanced to the attack at millikens bend they murdered prisoners at poison spring god alone knows how many helpless fugitives they murdered in the wake of shermans march to the sea they carried them away into slavery and they hanged them army correspondence makes very clear that the old practice of slave owners was continued of never making a record of punishments or cruelties it also makes certain that thousands of such cases occurred which can never be documented that continued after the war and down to the present time after the second battle of bull run lees army was in control of the battlefield and general pope was given permission to send men both to bury the union dead and to care for the wounded the men were sent on this mission of mercy but the negroes who drove the improvised ambulances and dug the graves were seized by the confederates and sold into slavery stonewall jackson carried away from harpers ferry all the negroes he could lay his hands on either lee knew about it or he was ignorant of what went on in his own army by january  he was pleading that slaves be brought into the army as soldiers and two months later the government heeded his request but he had never been willing to exchange negro troops with grant and one wonders how many such prisoners of war his men actually had taken apparently the choice of murdering or selling into slavery was left pretty much to the soldiers involved the richmond enquirer said that should the union place negroes in the field none would be taken prisoner because the troops understood what to do in such cases it added that if any negroes had been captured as soldiers in the enemys ranks the newspaper knew nothing about it closely related to this problem is that of why confederate soldiers who robbed the union dead of their clothes at nightand by the thousandsand did not hesitate to take the clothing off wounded soldiers on the battlefield would not rob dead negro soldiers of their uniforms there was a specious argument in some southern newspapers to the effect that negroes had no right to wear the uniform and therefore it was not legitimately before the confederate soldier to be taken something of the character of these men is revealed by the behavior of forrest who operated with his brothers one of the most infamous slave trading establishments in the country was brutal in his treatment of negroes during the war and afterward yet was said to have had two wives one white and one black and two children by each it is revealed too by their turning union prisoners who were colored or were white citizens of southern states over to state authorities to be shot as traitors when everyone involved in the rebellion was a traitor to the united states union officers such as hunter butler sherman and others were con demned to death in absentia by the davis government by state governments and by field commanders the practice was almost as common as the earlier one of offering large sums for the delivery dead or alive of prominent antislavery leaders the interesting point is that no matter what the offenses charged against them may have been the broad base of the indictment in every case as it had been in every charge against antislavery men was incitement of slaves to insurrection the one thing that saved the captured officers of negro troops was the large pool of confederate officers in union prison camps and the certainty that rooney lee second son of robert e lee would be the first one executed in retaliation general hunter held the sons of many prominent slaveholders as hostages to make certain that his own men would not be executed if captured jefferson daviss rejoinder to the emancipation proclamation which gave freedom to the slaves was that it doomed several millions of an inferior race to extermination and that it incited them to general assassination of their masters by urging them to abstain from violence unless in necessary selfdefense if the english language means anything here was an open threat of extermination who was to do it except southerners and where but in the south there was more to this however than the claim that union soldiers of color were not engaged in war but in sedition davis and his cohorts were claiming a legal peaceful right of secession they demanded that it be recognized they claimed the right of their states to compel citizens of the united states to resist the federal authority they denied the right of citizens to obey federal authority in resistance to state authority subordination of the federal government and subordination of the colored people went together in  and in  the fact that negro troops had compiled a brilliant record during the war only served to intensify hatred by the southern whites in defeat make no mistake about the contribution of those  regiments they fought brilliantly in a halfhundred important engagements nearly  of the  enlisted men lost their lives and  won congressional medals of honor make no mistake either of the hatred of confederate veterans toward them it was impossible to keep an army in the south forever and the killing to beat the negro down never ceased even momentarily until congress got control of reconstruction away from president johnson negroes were killed raped and robbed from one end of the south to the other and no record was ever made of individual cases then the master terrorist of the slave country nathan bedford forrest the commercial slave trader of prewar days the murderer of union prisoners at fort pillowtook over and the whole south was honeycombed by organizations of many names but for convenience called the ku klux klan the klan has persisted to the present time it was an organized defiance of all law a government within a government without legal sanctions in its origins preaching hatred only of people of color seeking to destroy every vestige of hope for liberty justice and equality reversing the verdict of the battlefield negro citizenship for all practical purposes was transformed over night into a huge joke everything they had gained was stripped away every brutality ever visited upon their slave parents were revisited upon them the klan was organized lawlessness it was a fountain of hatred it was the impenetrable barrier to equality it was to the united states what the nazis were to germany it did not create hatred it took all of the hatred violence and oppression coming out of  years of slavery and the rebellion consolidated it and nourished it through the years large parts of the south from that day to this have been under the rule of the klan it controls politics the police the courts the schools the churches the unions it represents systematized hatred of the negro the constitution and the government of the united states there is no dividing line between the violence of preklan days and klan days the thirteenth amendment became a part of the constitution december   congress passed a civil_rights act over johnsons veto april   less than one month later a bloody race riot occurred in memphis tennessee in which former confederate soldiers killed  negro refugees and two white men burned  homes  schools and four churches in new orleans july  they killed  and wounded  more schoolhouses were burned in tullahoma shelbyville gallatin athens knoxville and columbia books and equipment were destroyed with the buildings the worst of it was that the negroes were supporting these schools from their meager earnings and there was no way of restoring them early the following year the ku klux klan was organized and congress divided the area of rebellion into five military districts under an army of occupation it was little more than a skeleton force for administrative purposes having the numerical strength of an ordinary state police force it gave moral support to the reconstruction governments but was never strong enough to maintain order against the determined efforts of the klan waves of brutality murder and race riots swept across the black belt between the years  and  with the worst of the offenses in louisiana tennessee mississippi and south carolina new orleans opelousas vicksburg yazoo city and clinton were the scenes of downright massacres this was a veritable reign of terror with the klan whipping negroes murdering assaulting tarandfeathering schoolteachers burning the schools the churches and the homes where centered the activities which gave faith knowledge and selfrespect to the newly enfranchised negroes it did not arise from poverty of the whites but from opposition to education for the negroes to their participation in public affairs to their aspiration for equality driving out northern teachers did the job because there were no southern ones and the school system established by john eaton was broken up by  lincolns hope for a change in the basic structure of southern life had failed even in the most progressive state the first to be restored to the union in july  it was perfectly clear even by that time that the southern people were not going to look upon the negro any differently after  than they had before unless it be with more scorn and contempt the concept of racialism was retained not that of the equality of men restraints were removed from the klan schools were segregated registration of whites and blacks was kept in separate books the federal civil_rights act was bitterly denounced and nullified wherever possible defeat was inherent in the reconstruction program because the government had no intention of occupying the south with military forces for a prolonged period a horrible wave of brutality sadism and anarchy swept over the people of color again as soon as the army was withdrawn and the reconstruction governments fell the federal authorities either could not or would not but certainly did not protect them they were helpless to defend themselves the state and local governments were apathetic even the civil war did not teach the people of the united states that the rights of men must rest upon something more substantial than prevailing sentiment in a given community that they must rest upon law and not upon sufferance upon the national conscience not upon local prejudice all of the inequities to which the people of color were subjected thereafter added up to an imperfect freedom derived from the will of the community and dependent upon toleration rather than right the history of the prewar antislavery contest of the war itself and of the postwar strife in the former slave states shows that where local government controls the affairs of men the rights of men depend not upon the spirit of the law but upon the caprice of their fellow men at any given time and that is precarious tenure indeed the idea that the degree of civil freedom belonging to any person can rightfully be fixed by popular sentiment is wrong local government will not protect in the case of minority groups or of persons it dislikes or regards as inferior or fears these are the people who most need the protection of law because they ordinarily do not have the wealth the education the family connections or any of the other intangible assets which safeguard the rights of so many against encroachment these were the freedmen at the close of the civil war state laws went right on allowing the white people to do what they had always done victims were only people of color and life was cheap the will of the community reinforced by the heavy hand of death denied them equality of public services and enjoyment of the amenities of life restricted their earning capacity controlled their lives by irresponsible private power and arbitrary police authority and permitted education for work only and that in moderation they continued to live in squalid shacks because they were not allowed to live elsewhere they were denied access to work commensurate with their ability being excluded from all but unskilled labor in the white mans economic world they served in our wars and came back to squalor and oppression they accepted it or starved or got out they were victims of economic discrimination political exclusion social rejection and inferior education it was not and is not a question of civil_rights it was unfinished business it was the survival of slavery in a land dedicated to freedom a colossal betrayal of the principles on which the nation was founded a continuation of the agelong struggle of men to be free of human rights versus slavery for control of the nation of democracy in all its radiance against privilege and arbitrary power the nation shrank from its full responsibility in  and paid for its error with the lives of  young men it did the same in  and ushered in a century of paganism turned to anarchy the people of color had to be beaten down and they were beaten hanged burned mutilated and otherwise tortured this was the era of lynchingsthe same old formulathe same old methodthe same old objectiveboth on a grand scale and in a manner to attract the attention of the civilized world these lynchings were ofttimes great public attractions advertised in advance and attended by thousands of people between  and  there were  in georgia  in mississippi  in texas  in louisiana  in florida  in alabama and lesser numbers in other states to a total of  this was anarchy a complete desecration of constitutional government it was government by men and not by law these mobs claimed to represent the will of their communities they had claimed as much both north and south before the war when they roamed the streets of the cities spreading death and destruction and we suppose in a sense they did because it is difficult to say who is most guilty the ignorant and depraved who perpetrate such crimes or those who know the enormity of the offenses but do nothing to prevent them every person who ever committed an act of violence on a person of color is known or could have been known to law enforcement agencies a high percentage of those lynched both men and women were innocent of all wrong the objective was to beat the people of color down by fear many were lynched for such offenses as trying to act like a white man seeking employment acting as strikebreakers using offensive language making boastful remarks many of the victims were framed by women for instance to cover their own indiscretions lynchings like the trials of slaves in earlier days quickly prevented any evidence being established any testimony being presented any possibility of acquittal the basis of mob action was always rumor and the death of the victim the only certain fact victims as of old were hunted with bloodhounds there was always an eagerness for the hunt that could produce a mob in a matter of minutes and a craving for the satisfaction of momentary power shown by mock trials and executions for one moment in their lives a few men could play god sheriff judge jury and executioner they would have chased their victims to hell and back if necessary for that and they did take them from officers of the law from jails from court rooms and from hospital beds mobs were frequently more interested in torture than in the killing itself victims were sometimes tied to trees or fence posts and used for target practice their toes and fingers were cut off one joint at a time their teeth were pulled out with pliers their testicles were crushed or cut off or burned off they were strangled they were roasted over slow fires their bodies after they were dead were soaked with gasoline and burned they were dragged by ropes behind trucks until the flesh was torn from their bodies women sometimes with babies in their arms and children went to these affairs mothers were known to have wakened their children to take them to lynchings thousands of people were involved law enforcement officials bowed to the will of these mobs and seldom would juries indict or convict the reasons for this roman orgy are not hard to find the africans were captured torn from their homeland and made beasts of burden in a distant land they were freed with a great deal of help from themselves given citizenship in the land of their humiliation and suffered from the gift of the ballot at the hands of their country as much as they had from the gift of their color at the hands of god more of them were shot down in the first twenty years of freedom than in  years of slavery every step forward in knowledge and selfrespect hardened resistance all they ever wanted and asked for was an equal chance in the race of life a chance to be men it is a great tragedy that social reconstruction could not have been achieved in a respectable manner but the white people were drunk with power frenzied by the thought of interference and confirmed in the practice of evil deeds and doctrines for nearly a century that is a matter of history they would not have any part of it lawlessness in the former rebellious area to prevent it was appalling and to a large degree successful civil and political rights are still denied the people of color after a century of citizenship this concept of a white mans government grew stronger through the years the man of color who aspired to cast a ballot was dangerous he must be driven out or shot unless he renounced his rights as a man and a citizen we do not know how much weight to give to each of the several causes of this behavior but know with certainty what is involved and it is neither pleasant nor good from any point of view the first is a determination to keep an outmoded undemocratic even vicious political system which gives to the dominant whites complete control of local governments tremendous influence in political parties and the power to keep congress from passing laws for the benefit or protection of the people of color it gives white men in the old slave states with the lowest cultural level in the nation a great deal more power than anyone else in government they had it because they were slaveholders they have it because they oppress people of color and keep them from voting hatred has smothered the law it is the controlling factor the white people did not intend that the freedmen ever should make decisions or participate in public affairs not if they had to go to the brink of racial war to prevent it the second cause of oppression is a measure of personal happiness inequality seems at times to be nearer peoples heart than liberty itself there are millions who walk away from those who weep from those who are bowed down by heavy burdens from those who are lost in the storm and have nowhere to turn because they are despised they measure their happiness by someone elses misery their riches by someone elses poverty their intelligence by someone elses ignorance it seems paradoxical that such a large part of our personal satisfaction comes not from the richness of our own spiritual and material possessions but from the poverty of our neighbors not more than onethird of the white population of the slave states had any direct connection with slavery it kept the slave states poor it put a stigma upon labor it prevented the establishment of schools it drove the poor man out or up into the back country but the nonslaveholding population did nothing about it and one of the reasons was because they could look about them and see this large population of slaves so infinitely worse off than themselves the same held true after the civil war so long as they could keep the negro down they were content actually smug about their own ignorance poverty low level of culture and second rate achievements so the interests of the genteel politician and the redneck were joined people of color must never be allowed to make decisions or enter into the competition of achievement the white man had found his artificial badge of superiority in the paleness of his skin it was not man against man but one portion of the population against another the degree to which people of color insisted upon equality before the law was the measure of the degree of violence upon them trouble did not come from a recognition of equal rights but from their denial
the third cause of oppression had to do with sex one can not dig very deep into the history of slavery or into the postwar era of race relations without being aware of its importance female slaves were fair game for any white man thousands were bought and sold for no other purpose and every place of public accommodation had its complement of female slaves to wait upon gentlemen guests slaveholders their sons overseers and apparently anyone else of mercurial temperament had a field day there was no one to whom the woman could appeal for protection without danger of terrible punishment the law provided no protection slaves were only property and rape was trespass the enormous amount of mixed blood forced back into the slave population was proof of their helplessness it was one of the reasons and a very powerful one for the fight to preserve slavery one very competent authority says that fifty per cent of the people of color in the southern cities in  were of mixed blood the situation was no different after the war the grievances of these oppressed people were many and they are sickening but the one expressed with most vehemence and bitterness even today is the inability of the men to protect their women they were vulnerable to abuse by employers landlords and professional men of every sort complaint led only to heartaches at home resistance led to starvation and reprisal led to death it was the price an oppressed people had to pay for the poor privilege of staying alive white women hated the victims of their menfolk and it was the white women who would not accept association of the two groups except upon the basis of their own superiority equality was ruled out in the fourth place people are cruel and happily so they are more cruel to their fellow men than they are to animals the whites were unspeakably cruel to the slaves and they were equally so to the freedmen their victims had a will to resist which fed the flames of passion slaves were whipped and branded and castrated and starved by their owners and overseers whose will was law pregnant women were hunted with dogs and slaves who ran away were shot freedmen were whipped and castrated and hanged and burned and shot and set upon by dogs there was no one to protect them as slaves and there was no one to protect them as free persons why should a people who had learned to love brutal exhibitions give up its ready made pool of victims about whom no one was concerned finally there was the refusal of the old slave states to accept the verdict of the civil war the south always had been a land of stagnation and frustration and the negro was blamed for the whole of it the union was dedicated to freedom but the south was determined to keep slaves the union like the rest of the civilized world was moving toward free dom and equality for all men but the south chose to break up the union to preserve slavery it lost the war because its constitutional philosophy of decentralization could destroy but not create a nation it clung to the doctrine and to as much of slavery as it could salvage because it was the key to white supremacy the central theme of southern history is negro inferiority when historians continued to talk about slavery as a humane and benevolent institution and anthropologists about racial inequalities as an established scientific fact when the flag of rebellion was flown beside or above the stars and stripes in schoolrooms when men in public office shouted from the housetops their devotion to state sovereignty which never was when preachers and teachers and lawyers and newspaper editors demanded segregation foreverwhen all these things were true and the ku klux klan was allowed to flourish is there any wonder that people of color were beaten and shot and treated like dogs so were a people crucified three centuries of oppression three centuries of patient effort to attain full measure of freedom emancipation was something more than a formality it carried with it the human rights of men we failed to sustain those rights and freedom became a mockerywe pass then to a pattern of oppression much broader in scope segregation was renewed in all of its hateful forms some of which prevailed throughout the entire nation and grew worse through the years the person of color might have refuse scattered in his yard crosses burned before his home stones thrown through his window he might be shoved off the streets or abducted at night and severely beaten or have his house burned down he might be discharged from his job the bus might pass him by as he waited in vain for public transportation hospitals might refuse him admittance physicians and dentists might be always too busy to serve his needs banks might refuse him credit his neighbors might set up elaborate schemes to prevent him from buying or renting property in the community he might sit unserved in a public restaurant wait for hours to buy a pair of shoes or be tossed bodily out of a bar all of these things might happen and have happened a million times because the protection of persons and property is in the hands of local police officials they can be and are negligent in performance of their duty and brutal in their treatment of individuals who have done no wrong and they were invariably both where the person of color was concerned what could these people do when police officials would not protect and juries would not convict officials behaved like people wanted them to behave or they were not elected to office white people were protected against police brutality and illegal arrest because they were white people the people of color had no protection at all except the law and there was no one to make police officials obey the law they sat behind shuttered windows at night and none of them ever walked down a street with complete assurance of being able to get home again unmolested prejudice discrimination oppressioncall it what you willagainst our people of color is a form of social insanity it is destroying all of us whatever harms a part of society harms all of it it is destroying our government god himself gave color to man and from that color we have fashioned a single law that supersedes all constitutions and statutes the law of public opinion in a community it destroys equality when some people have to obey the orders of other people equality is extinguished the sure guaranty of peace and security of each race said justice john marshall harlan is the clear distinct unconditional recognition by our governments national and state of every right that inheres in civil freedom and of equality before the law of all citizens of the united states without regard to race    we boast of freedom enjoyed by our people above all other people but it is difficult to reconcile that boast with a state of law which practically puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow citizens our equals before the law john marshall harlan had been a slaveholder he had been opposed to the thirteenth amendment but he had fought under thomas to preserve the union and constitutional government he believed in justice in equality of rights and in government by law

she most essential question confronting me is the psychological and physical survival of the black man in america i believe that it is impossible for me to separate myself from the collective survival of my people most of our problems whether we wish to accept this or not are group problems further they are basically the results of centuries of a unique kind of oppression the only salvation for us therefore is to translate our individual problems into group problems and then as a group proceed to eliminate them we must survive as a people not as a collection of assimilated freaksrootless and faceless as a writer and social activist i believe it is necessary therefore to address my art ideas and actions to the collective needs of my people it is my duty to trans ditions which our people face into form the oppressive objective con something more compatible with our physical and spiritual needs it is my duty also to help my people destroy the slave mentality which affects us all it is my duty to listen to the voice of my people to learn from them and to dedicate my life to total liberation of us all it is my duty to protect myself and my people from the enemy within as well as without i feel that there is no higher duty that a black man can perform in this society considering the condition his people find themselves in we must seek the total liberation of black people from all aspects of their oppression we must remember that our current ideas are the products of a particular kind of history a history which began when my forefathers were sold into slavery that our lives have been influenced by people like malcolm_x the writings of garvey du bois monroe trotter claude mckay and frederick douglass i would like to believe that i am an extension of these forces that i am motivated by the spirit of the nat turners the denmark veseys and a friend named herbie johnson who died from an o d when he was seventeen and by millions upon millions of unknown black people who slaved to survive like my parents did so that one day their sons and daughters would rise up take  control and reclaim their manhood currently i am greatly motivated by the ideas of writers and thinkers like frantz fanon charles fuller bill davis rolland snellings and the theoretical writings of harold cruse and max stanford le roi jones writings on music and his play black mass have recently provided meaningful insights into the spiritual nature of black people there are so many excellent and relevant black writers and creative artists there is a writer in philly named james stewart who under better social conditions would be recognized as a writer of great depth and intensity of course there are also colleagues like dan watts editor of liberator and social activists and writers like ted wilson and eddie ellis all of these writers have one thing in common and that is a consummate desire to see black people liberated by any means necessary they are willing to sacrifice everything they have to accomplish these ends and this is finallyit must bemore important than any single creative or artistic trait that they may have for finally our art will be judged in terms of its relevancy to the age that produced us and the degree to which we were willing to extend it into reality in the end nothing else will matter whether it was aesthetically perfect or artful or if it lacked craft others after us will ask did it help liberate us what are the crucial issues of our times for us as i have already stated it is survival and the nature of that survival further can we survive as long as the white man dominates the world with his idea of what the world should be i believe we can not therefore we must understand that in order for us to survive we must come together as a people organize to confront the western white man on all levels of conflict we must look at this struggle from the perspective of what fanon calls the third world that is internationally in terms of the developing nations of africa asia and latin america we must see ourselves as the extension of that third world situated in the bosom of the beast in doing this we must assign ourselves the task of developing a new humanism so that we may ultimately create a synthesis of the best that mankind has to offer and thereby move to alter the existing power relationships then and then only is there hope for our children then and then only will we understand what manhood is it is not about what moynihan and other white sociologists say it is it is not about assimilating into a dying society totally lacking in spiritual substance it must be about something much deeper something much more pertinent to the overall needs of black people and if blood must flow so that our black spirit can prevail then damn it let it flow otherwise look forward to a bland existence in the wilderness of white america look forward to the pervasive mediocrity of western society inundating us and the entire nonwhite world these are harsh realities they are not intended to soothe but to create conflict meaningful conflict among a people who have generally been in a semihypnotic state currently the question of black_power occupies the center of our lives it must continue to do so everything that i have spoken about must ultimately be dealt with in terms of powerphysical psychological and spiritual black people are being asked very concrete questions about the political structure of america it is becoming clear that neither the democrats nor the republicans offer any meaningful solutions to our problems black people must have their own political structure in which to determine their own destiny the future of peoples of african descent living in america is dependent upon the degree to which these and other salient realities are understood and accepted we must give our total selves to the struggle to achieve our human rights and finally it is in struggle that we will learn who we are
the many problems  rj  personal or otherwise which preoccupy me l today revolve around the readiness and preparedness of my new breed generation to replace its elders in racial leadership my concern is primarily within the areas of values overall maturity and last but not least ideological clarity too oftenin many nations im afraiddo young intellectuals and activists satisfy themselves with oversimplified solutions to vastly complicated problems which involve the destinies of countless peoples i emphasize this because until recently i had been guilty of these mistakes in the current africanamerican freedom struggle we are witnessing the epic rise of a people to national consciousness identity and selfrespect along with concrete historically justified aspirations for selfdetermination needless to say this movement will not wait for moderation or gradual methods of social change slogans are often strategic and necessarya psychic tonicif and when they reflect the spiritual desires of the oppressed but slogans alone are not enough neither is onesided dogmatic thinking we must constantly remind ourselves that our generation has been extremely fortunate to come into its own in this historic era our slave and freedman ancestors wouldve given their right arms to be in our shoes and we must act with the awareness that the decisions we make as leaders will affect the lives of our peopleand perhaps the worldfor years to come if we guided by nihilistic dogmamerely sloganize and postulate while neglecting the organization political cultural and economic of our peoplebacking up our slogansthen we will have failed our people and future generations it is dramatic and stimulating mounting the tribune above the crowd and screaming defiance at our oppressors amid encouraging shouts and approving cheers but it is ever so much more difficult to engage in the backbreaking labor of organizing ourselves and our brothers into the institutions which will provide the programs to guide us to selfdetermination too often we get lost in adulation and other egosicknesses forgetting that its not ones image or reputation but ones deeds which are instrumental in creating the final victory or tragic defeat within the general framework of organization lies the area of mental or philosophical organizationideology within the struggle within the ranks of the youth we have a diversity of ideologies from mysticism bordering on racism to maoism fanonism garveyism etc and some positive synthesis must be developed which will unify this babel of theories into one invincible africanamericanism geared to victory also theres the question of positive revolutionary standards and values i would warn our people that many opportunists are screaming black and brother and sister today this is now the hip thing we must develop positive values within the movement so that any demogogue who yells down with whitey is not mistaken for a black leader only positive standards and revolutionary values can arm our people against opportunism in all of its forms if a socalled militant doesnt live eat and sleep like the people then he bears watching if the brothers and sisters on the block in the bars poolrooms beauty parlors and barbershops dont know usas the sncc militants are knownthen were not doing our jobs we can romanticize about magic new culture etc but material progress for our broad masses will do more spirituallyand culturallythan a thousand witch chants an afroamerican peoples council composed of grassroots delegates dealing with concrete rural and ghetto problems is worth more than a thousand semibourgeois coffee and fashion shops a national afroamerican congress led by popular elementsis worth more than a million adulatory photographsgiant sizein militant black publications this is not meant to deny the positive values of our african and afroamerican cultural movement our music history art etc but it is merely a question of emphasis frantz fanon among others has written that colonial peoples are remaking their cultures when they are in the streets fighting for freedom also there are certain elements who would substitute culture for concrete work with the people so we have much work to do in all areas in the coming months and yearsand much personal growing however i am optimistic i have faith in our people and in our youth luckily we have the inspiring writings and deeds of the great men and women who have shaken the oppressive orders of the twentieth century the warriors thinkers and prophets of the wretched of the earth from preworld war europe to the current tricontinental revolution we have examples of courageous writers and thinkers men and women who trod the awesome path to victory or death du bois garvey padmore lenin trotsky mao fanon guevara nkrumahto mention a few and their works are available to those of us who would study the past in order to define the present and chart the course to the future what we as afroamericans must understand is that this is not a new battle that we fight it has been continuously fought since the first group of people were enslaved against their wills if we and our generation do not succeed it will continue until certain people realize that as long as a few have while the worlds peoples have not the earth will be unfit for human habitationyes the haves and the have nots when our generation speaks it is the tongue the voice of the wretched of the earth within this land black_power freedom now malcolm lives burn baby burn these are the battlecries of a nation in chainsthe shouts of defiance affirming justice and the rights of man we embody the primary issues now facing humanity whether the worlds peoples will be allowed to determine their own destinies or be policed by selfappointed emperors bent upon destructionby bomb gun or gas whether the worlds wealth will be equally shared among the masses of men or hoarded by a selfish few whether the worlds affairs will be governed by the opinions of the masses of peoplesdemocraticallyor by those of a few monopolies oligarchies or power elites we young men and women we  new breed afroamericans are not really a phenomenon one sees us in the hard eyes of latin students revolting against the latest caudillo backed by the gringo empire our hands grip the rifles of asian youth dedicated to freeing and uniting their countries trampling down the palaces of miniature hitlers our hearts beat amid the vibrant passion of the youth of congo mozambique tanzania and dishonored ghana we are the newnew men and women with new visions of human destiny as for the africanamerican future i can only repeat that much of it rests upon our untried shoulders we must honestly labor and strive to prepare ourselves for the herculean tasks that lie ahead the broad masses of our people long suppressed are now stirring to life never to sleep again we have provided the slogans that shook the collective psyche kindling the flames of hope within our national heart this is a beginning the great africanamerican people are now assuming their collective personality a nation is emerging upon the stage of history woe to those who distort its aims or trample upon its dreams but we must also recognize the depths of our situation that our problems are inextricably linked to those of the american republic and through it to the world this latter problem will require all of our broadvisioned maturity and courage if it is to be solved we must take a full and careful look at the white americansstudy them as they have studied us we must realize that they are not one vast monolithic whitey but are composed of various ethnic groupings nationalities classesprogressives reactionaries liberals idealists etc we must encourage dialogue as brother malcolm did in his later years as the black_power paper says teach whites their roles encourage those who are sincere to repudiate their latent native racism developed systematically within them through the centuries by one of the most vicious systems known to man    so that they can rise to our humanistic level this does not mean that we will become toms or lose our black consciousness it means that we must take the lead for the first time in history in restoring humanism to this republic for to be black or africanamerican in these times in this land is to be the bearers of light and human spirituality among a people wretchedly starved and dying for lack of inner essence and spiritual truth we wouldnt change we would still be black brothers and sistersmore so and deeper because we would function as a spiritualas well as political and socialvanguard of the future if we succeed if we can accomplish these tasks i see a total restructuring of american society into a true haven for democracy the longawaited american revolution i see a place of honor for the africanamerican nation among the councils of humanity if we fail i see utter destruction a colonial race wararmageddonwhich will despoil this republic making the fall of rome resemble a picnic destroying the majority of its people along with their great creative potential however again i am optimistic i believe that we have it within us to accomplish these tasksprovided we properly prepare ourselves the past was dark the night is long but we bring the sunrise
the most pervasive  nr y trend for todays  i r young black intellects i uals is their vigor and degree of selfconsciousness about being black the dynamics of american assimilation have backfired and given rise to an unintended revolution black people have an increased sensitivity in reacting to the institutionalized nature of bigotry and are developing a more positive regard for black culture and community for the older black generation this has meant an escalation of the traditional pattern of negotiating for progressive changes while for young blacks the revolution means reconstituting the basic processes of u s life as they affect black people only by grasping this central theme is it possible to understand the brooding anger hostility and danger of black attitudes and actions these generalizations are based on a rapidly growing number of actions being undertaken by black people to combat racism such as legal changes sought by the naacp militant resistance as displayed by robert williams mass marches and negotiations as directed by sclc and northern urban riotrebellions rather than attempt an analysis of some collection of these actions and in so doing spell out how i agree and disagree with aspects of each i will offer a sample of pointed personal reflections as evidence for such generalizations in other words by pointing out which people i feel are sayingdoing significant things and outlining some issues of considerable importance hopefully the general theme will be made more concrete the two men most clearly embodying the essential character of the black intellectual rebellious freedom courageous integrity wisdom and social consciousness are malcolm_x and w e b du bois malcolm_x presented black manhood as a possibility not via the normal whiteorientated status channels but by emerging from the black community he possessed a style of life and rhetoric around which a movement of decisive proportions could have been assembled his published autobiography is a modern classic destined to supplant up from slavery which is still quite in demand as the negro life study to become familiar with his life shows at least three reactions to the american scene he was a nigger of the ghetto with little hope of escaping crime and a life of fear after becoming a muslim malcolm emerged as the spokesman for a position of total black alienation from american whites malcolm grew in stature he then began developing a view which focused on the problems appreciating the problematic nature of whites and heading toward a more differentiated dynamic view of american society this latter development in the thought of malcolm_x presents a challenge for someone to continue it while already constituting a fresh perspective from which to program a new black selfconsciousness du bois is the one outstanding black intellectualactivist who continued trying to promote changes in the american society without compromising the interests of black people he joined an unrelenting scientific career with a spirit of communalism for the folk culture of black people the regrettable fact is not that we have lost him by death for his was a full and productive life but the popular misuse of his life and work by ideological groups of small significance and polite bourgeois blacks with short memories albert camus serviced all men by discussing the man who rebels the one who has the courage to say no by not being black he broadens the horizon and presents the possibility of an international revolutionary spirit but there are many who are in the process of creating who are still reaping the influence of such men as malcolm du bois and camus when summarizing the most relevant writers of today it would be important to cite the penetrating insights and critical precision of ralph ellison the cathartic quality of leroi jones expressive tragedy the brutal surrealistic truths of chester himes and the colorful poetic symbols of melvin tolson these men are creatively interpreting the black experience in american life the question of what these and other writers are saying must remain for reading them or their critics interpreting these writers must be a dynamic process because the blackwhite problem is so explosive and consequently in need of constant reevaluation nevertheless it is possible to undertake a general formulation of issues faced by them one major issue is the managed illusion and destructive impact of certain popular u s american concepts and norms an example of this is the blind worship of political citizenship a practice which falsely categorizes issues into foreign and domestic and at the same time denies existing sociopolitical categories of american life the  consensus and conflicts of race religion nationality and social class are what dominate american life each of these is grounded in the peculiar development of american history but at the same time is linked to an international pattern of a similar nature the issue involves the need to face problems with a more concrete less naive view of social and political reality as an example the fact of poverty in india mississippi or haiti presents the same constellation of problems for which we must begin to think of the same programs for their solutions people are hungry the people are colored the land has been raped by corrupt and oppressive political regimes the same forces are at work promoting overt racism in rhodesia south africa angola mississippi watts and harlem and we cannot promote change unless we follow the advice of claude mckay and for their thousand blows deal one death blow and similarly the barbaric death game of the viet nam war a second major issue concerns the nature of the goals of the black community with the increased potential of technology and mechanical efficiency reigning as the supreme value black people must reassess and thereby reconstitute their values in light of this baldwin has rhetorically asked who wants to integrate into a burning house black people on the streets of many cities gave their answer with the rioters cry bum baby burn who can say perhaps there was no other way for those black people to express themselves and feel confident that they were heard however if we remain on this level the depth of the problem will cause everyone to burn the problem demands that we find and cultivate a basis on which to save ourselves and hopefully everybody in the midsts of antihuman values and antipeople institutions this leads us to the last major issue id like to discuss as every major social analyst has reported america is controlled and managed by power if this be true then a man or a people without power is a ward of those in power for possessing power makes one an autonomous agent from the immediate control of others with power people need power black people need black_power the central point is that the black community in order for black people to survive and develop a positive standard of life must develop social economic and political power autonomous from the immediate control by outside forces in addition to the obvious material results of such a development even the use of the term has meaning too long the images and concepts held by blacks have been projected in the interests of others the communications media made the term black_power into a fearsome cry a veritable war whoop well thats exactly what it is but the really frightening thing is that the war is not going to be a nat turner or mau mau affair the frightening thing is that nobody knows what its going to be like the dictums of a systematic ideology are no longer relevant the dictums must now come from hopefully serious dialogue between the intellectuals use of scientific knowledge and the experience of the people or the experience of the people will speak for itself ergo watts even in light of these and other problems i can turn to the future with some optimism this results from my faith in human beings to rebel and also from the degree of brotherhood i have experienced yes the future of black people must be understood with this in mind we an ever growing number of black intellectuals are committing our lives to the black community in hopes of surviving of everyone surviving our version of the national anthem is being wailed by such as john coltrane and archie shepp our soldiers are organizers for sncc and other such organizations our armageddon is fast approaching in sum as put by black poet laureate of harlem langston hughes o let america be america again the land that never has been yet and yet must be the land where every man is free
the issue most crucial v to our times in amerj ii g ica is the struggle for  human rights now being waged and most significantly in our streets the black mans struggle in america is but a part of the total picture viewing other places such as south africa reveals that the struggle against racism is the most crucial one facing the world today as a black man in america i can only address myself to the problems which directly affect me i dont think black men should place problems existing elsewhere ahead of the problems in america however much they might be related the only author who truly addressed himself to the problems of the twentieth century dr w e b du bois cut swiftly to the marrow of the problem with his prophecy that the problem of the century would be the color line most of the writers who have addressed themselves to the problem have merely echoed what du bois said early in this century unless there is total social change i foresee a bleak future for black people in america without total change negroes may expect to experience in the future what they are experiencing today that  policemen are required to protect a few hundred black people who try to walk down a street as happened in chicago this summer is symbolic of what negroes are now experiencing for the great majority of negroes the future looks bleak both economically and socially the white man has everything going for him at this point and he is determined to preserve the status quo one can readily understand upon looking at the position the white man occupies in america today why he will not change unless he is forced to america today is a white mans country it was created for him and he has spent an enormous amount of time and energy maintaining this structure the lesson of slavery teaches us that the founding fathers turned their backs on the black man at the inception of this country and their example has been since followed the white man refuses to understand that black people simply want the rights white people enjoy they  do not try to understand this because to do so would be admitting that they have wronged a people and they do not want to admit this fact or come to terms with their guilt the rights of black people to peaceably assemble are restricted in this country as a result of the hatred of whites thus black people who protest are reprimanded while white hecklers are tolerated while admitting that the cause of protesters is right and just the establishments in our cities use every legal means to restrict protest and in effect perpetuate the denial of the rights negroes are striving for the efforts of leaders such as dr martin_luther_king jr while most laudible seem doomed to failure you cant use a philosophy people do not accept in order to change people dr_kings belief is strong and sure the tragedy is that the majority of white americans do not accept his philosophy or share his dream about the brotherhood of man acts of hatred on the part of white northerners this summer unveiled a heretofore hidden beast the cries of chicagos mayor daley and other principals of the northern establishmentconsidering dr_king a meddling outsiderare not unlike the cries from the southland shades of wallace barnett eastland and company the black man is told that he can only do that which the white man approves for example black people are told to turn their backs on stokely carmichael because whites do not approve of what he says much of the truth in what carmichael is saying is completely glossed over by whites attempts to discredit carmichael are largely the result of white peoples fear of what they have interpreted his message to be though the white man goes to great lengths to prove that the negro cant achieve his goal without aid of the white man it is certain that most of what the black man has accomplished in america has been without the aid of all save a handful of whites the cry black_power has been heard while in essence it is true that an ethnic group should control the community where it is the majority it also is true that the negro must achieve his goals within the framework of the existing society the negro must join the american mainstream as a full citizen if american citizenship is the negros goal the negro cannot practice race hatred to exclude a man from participation in society on the basis of skin color whether white or blackno matter what name you give the exclusionis race hatred black_power has a beautiful ring and sound but we cant get hung up on slogans and allow the nicesounding things men say to mislead us so long as the white majority does not fully accept black politicians whatever power wielded by black politicians though controlled by and sensitive to the desires of the black community will remain second class power the black man cannot prevail in america as a separate entity he is too small a minority but to date the black man has never been a full citizen a part of the american mainstream with that thought in mind it naturally follows that white men must admit that black men have rights which whites have to respect disrespect for black men on the part of white men is responsible for most of the racial hangups in america the negro is not attempting to win and influence white people but instead is attempting to bring about complete social change in america this can be achieved without love but it cannot be achieved without respect most white people are totally opposed to the equality of negroes in this society the mere thought of negroes as their equal caused many white chicagoans to ban together this summer under a banner nazism thousands of americans died fighting against the white man must accept black men as equals for two very good reasons economic and social progress it is fast becoming economically unfeasible to maintain segregation in america increased technological competition between the worlds nations make folly of this system which wastes the talents and skills of millions of people the future of america is completely intertwined with the future of the negro in america if the negro does not become a citizen in the fullest sense this america may cease to exist to be sure there will be a nation here called america but it will not be the land conceived of in the american dream how unlike the poland of  is the poland of today and the change occurred because poland refused to make the social changes that were needed to assure longevity for the peoples dreams as a nation america cant continue to exist with vast numbers of her nativeborn constantly seeking freedom unless the dynamic change which must take place occurs this america is doomed another may arise but this one will surely fall whenever honest discussion about the negro and his struggle takes place the red flag is waved by the bigots and the reactionaries it should be loudly shouted that communismnor any other ism is not the gravest threat confronting america today rather the greatest threat rests within her own shores the white mans problem his inability to accept the black man has for too long lingered without solution the racial problems confronting america today are more the white mans than the black mans the black man is merely asserting that he wants the same rights as the white man that he become a citizen in fact as well as in law 
the movement has radij t   cally reoriented my i own conception of the p vocation i have chosen for to be a preacher is a strange and glorious but nonetheless terrifyingcalling in america at midcentury to preach gods word by tongue alone is not enough one must seek to unleash the creative energies which that word claims on its own merits by putting ones body where once he had cast his rhetoric it is in nathan scotts inimitable eloquence to dare test the spirits to see if they are of god  for certain allwhite communities in the greater chicago area remind us of the bitter harvest sown in the deceptive employment of terminology about god rather than encounter with gods children on the multiple jericho roads which bisect the city and which are shifting the boundaries of its ghettos no preacher can ease by without knowing the issues of our time    and the knowing is less a matter of literacy than of identification with those whose dispossession and basic powerlessness make them as they were in the days of isaiah micah and amosthe primary issues of the era affairs are certainly soul size it is for this reason that the men of literature who have struck chords of wintered discontent and yearlong searching in me are james baldwin particularly in nobody knows my name the fire next time notes of a native son albert camus his essay neither victims nor executioners the stranger and the plague joseph kafkas the trial lerone bennett especially striking was the negro mood before the mayflower and confrontation black and white thomas wolfes you cant go home again and the web and the rock and of course the anonymous poets who distilled from those mysteries wrapped in enigmas the great wisdom of ages and with gods inspiration created the holy bible man will be in eternal quest for his myths somewhere arthur miller another author who has reached me with peculiar force has written that we must stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and on the laurels of our ancestors lest we cheapen the myth by horatory tribute to the past indeed in our own parochial experience the appeal for black_power is the quest for an authentic myth to articulate a consciousness too long dormant in the ghettos of harlem cleveland los angeles and chicago for in the houghs and in the watts of our cities there too is a nation now in labor through the traumatic crisis and travail of its new birth of freedom we can not afford to abort that event for it rages against the dying of light in all men ours need not be a tragic era if we but live it outside platos cave and in the reflection of gods intent for man namely to live in communityand in truth
chicago as a case j ir t  study certain predicj ii j £ tions can be made on the future of the negro in america first o utmost importance is that negroes are locked in the central city the consequence of this fact is not only slums but a systematic institutionalized system of subjugation perhaps in ten years chicago negroes will be divided into three categories  the cogs in the system or the supporters of the system basically these will be the educated negroes teaching in the poverty program and the high paid civil_rights leaders their subsistence is derived from supporting the system through hollow attempts to rehabilitate lower income negroes  lower income negroes in chicago have been colonized into a definite welfare section of the city largely encompassed by public housing the colony of   negroes is supported by public assistance directed and guided by a large welfare bureaucracy as such they are told what to do where to go patrolled by armed guards and as indicated in the above paragraph are placed in a tug of war with the professional negro who derives his in come from giving them services  there is a minute third category which is essentially black radicals composed of artists and activists if recent trends are any indication of what happens to this category then they are in a precarious position usually they are arrested for insurrection degraded or pushed off as absurdities there are reasons for this essentially the vested private interests in the ghetto are ostensibly the liberals in the northern city especially jewish interests in the ghetto they hobnob with civil_rights leaders support their activities openly and claim antisemitism when negroes attempt to force them out the radicals are a threat both to financial interests in the ghetto and to the service group of professional negroes the future of the negro in the united states really depends on the success of the minute third category the radical blacksor as courtland cox of sncc says those close to the community using what i here choose to call politicalcultural integration those close to the community will probably choose certain paths a develop a consciousness among negroes through cultural extensions which whites cannot interpret and which they fear such as music poetry art etc b using these cultural extensions as political avenues to organize all blacks into a formidable political base which is securely knotted by the trust in the consciousness of culture i choose to use the northern ghetto simply because the south is becoming highly urbanized and if the achievement of the politicscultural integration can occur in the north it can occur in the south or concomitantly if sncc can achieve the consciousness of blacks based on this type of integration in cities like atlanta then the knowledge can be utilized in the north the other alternative is complete takeover of the black ghetto in the north and through violent power forcing the federal government to deal directly both financially and politically with the black ghetto envisioning this process the takeover of one street instead of burning the stores and houses could perpetuate this process i mean forcing white merchants out of the ghetto thereby forcing them out of the civil_rights movement which in a few years will probably be atrophied i also envision the development of cooperatives by blacks and the rearrangement of land use patterns to accommodate new residential and commercial functions a black renewal and black planning process i dont think this is a figment of the imagination although it may sound like a novel what the world doesnt understand is that if stokely carmichael and the coterie of brains advising him in sncc or northern student movement nsm in detroit and philadelphia are ignored now then the efforts of the vested liberal interests in the ghetto and of the traditional civil_rights organizations will prove successful fifteenyearolds will be twenty in five years and they wont stand for liberalism or the welfare ghetto or phonies i am not merely parading the slogan of black_power but its time that negroes understood that a lilywhite suburb is white power not simply because the population is  per cent white but because they have control of their zoning density and landuse patterns actually the planning of the ghetto by negroes induces shared power in the metropolitan area at the present the suburb is the mansion and the central city is the cotton field the analogy is useful since negroes are actually working to support the leisure class of the suburbs in the south they would kill the slave that didnt till the fields now when negroes say that they want to plan their communities it is called antisemitism or it is claimed that this will cause a white backlash after a riot when negroes rampage the streets and burn the exploitative stores cant people see that negroes dont want the stores that they would decide the functions of commercial interests in their neighborhoods are people trying to say that negroes dont know where to locate parks theaters and houses in their communities actually the bitterness arising between civil_rights groups concerning black_power is absurd sclcs and snccs home base atlanta has developed into an interesting idea of shared power in a metropolitan area obstensibly the west side of atlanta with the commercial interests of hunter street the shaded homes and the educated negroes is nothing less  than black_power within a community inducing shared power in the city the intensity of negro culture that greets you on hunter street in atlanta is a landmark of what negroes can do here you can hear horace silver ramsey lewis perhaps hear leroi jones read poetry in a coffee shop all in a black community why should negroes prefer to move into an allwhite community and listen to the beatles undoubtedly as far as i am concerned black people will have to build rehabilitate and plan within the ghetto simply the other alternative of asking and inducing the middleincome negro to leave the central city and move into the suburbs not only destroys the cultural patterns that are beautiful and significant to the negro but it is asking him to give up his right to determine what is best within his own race i am wrapped up in the idea of being black as i see it the only way that the three groups of negroes previously mentioned here do not develop is that black people plan their communities from churches to chicken shacks whether america wants to admit it or not this is what negroes are going to want my little sister already knows what it means to be black at  and she accepts it if because i know that my sister cant be deceived by liberalism or her friends and i want to see her live and enjoy being black means that i support black_power then i do no negro can afford the deceptions of liberalism and technological progress the only way black people can participate in these changes is the utilization of progressive methods in their own communities
a real question that we a f have to deal with is i whether or not black  people can act to end racism within the framework of america if not and i think not how do we get them out of that framework that is to ask where do we look to for strength and when asking that become sharply aware that there is no sense of a positive history in the black community only the negative history of being oppressed by the white man it seems to me that our work is to meet that problem with the people we work with and to help deal with it in terms of program i suspect that we will not be able to do much more than lay the foundation for the kind of struggle that black people will have to wage but we can begin to educate the people we work with to their history and i dont mean the history of the white man rather the history of nonwhite people and their role in the stream of world history i accept africa as the cradle of civilization and have to translate this fact to the people in lowndes county alabama in helping them get over the negativeness theyve been taught to feel about being black black people in this country who for so long have been told that they are only  per cent of this countrys population will have to see themselves as not independent of the nonwhites in south africa or in guatemala we can no longer consider ourselves part of the united states except as struggling colonial subjects the land of our birth is africa we join with the worldwide black belt in its struggle against white american oppression it is certain that nonwhites within the boundaries of the united states will be doing different things than nonwhites in other places but we have to develop a sense of working together in the same thing or against the same thing that is while were doing different things see ourselves as not independent of each other what this lays out for logical progress the only way black people can participate in these changes is the utilization of progressive methods in their own communities continued from page  black people in lowndes county or harlem or greenville mississippi is that what they build they have to control we cannot do that within the context of building a better america which is to say building for america and thats the heart of why sncc has to move towards blackness for us to talk about blackness is to talk about where we can find the basis of building within the framework of a concept of justice towards a civilized society it cannot be found in white americaat least by black people certainly black people are not above wanting decent medical care shelter food clothing even luxuries those things are not in and of themselves bad but america can only give us these things at the cost of our humanity and then it can only give us a barely adequate amount integration into america cannot give us dignity and humanity for it ignores the fact that the society we allegedly can integrate into has always depended on the negation of black people as human beings this fact alone exposes the lie that its possible for black people as a roup to integrate into america for the humanity of white people depends upon the destruction of the foundation of white supremacy this is not to say that sncc organizes around hatred of whites hatred of whites is a legitimate reaction among black people and im not going to put it down james baldwin once wrote that the aware black man is in a state of perpetual rage but sncc emphasizes that being black is not negative and that black people must understand what america has done to black people if we talk about white america about what it is in fact we can get black people to understand that there is no freedom in becoming a part of america the contradiction becomes even clearer when black people understand what they are in fact if that gets translated by white people as organizing hatred of white folks then thats white folks problem thats an expression of white guilt and a demonstration of the fact that white people are not ignorant of what they have done there will be hatred there is hatredthere are many reasons for nonwhites to hate white people there will be violence exposing the truth about what white america has done to us not only in this country but around the world could lead to indiscriminate violence or discriminate in that its directed at white oppression 
as artist my major problem is to do some of the same things that lsd is doingblowkeanrssm ing minds expanding consciousness black consciousness as a black artist i am working toward reversing the value orientation of the black man in america that decadent value system imposed upon him by whites i believe this can be done in several ways but one manner in which i am participating is by giving the black man a literature of his own a literature with those oppressive values of the dominate american culture diminished to the minimum the american society denies the black man a recognition of existence it dehumanizes him so a literature with black symbols relacing white symbols is needed a literature with newly created black myths and a reestablishment of positive folkways must evolve from the experiences of black artists who have sprung from the people we artists must create a literature with its own band of fantastic black heroes through literature theater and art the revolutionizing of the consciousness of the black people can be achieved as well as establishing channels of black mass communications in giving the black man his own values this aids in combating the white cultures domination our peoples sense of reality has always been distorted by definitions by whites and this must be halted i do not want a black art that is an offshoot of white art or culture or a darker reflection of the white mans hated society a completely mutated and revolutionary form of black aesthetics is needed to foster new ways of thinking and to release the pentup feelings which is the heritage of the sensitive black man black art must go against be against white psychology philosophy and aesthetics black art and ideas should spring from the black masses and should be communicated to the black masses the problem that threatens the black artist is not to become a better artist in the sense of bourgeois white america but to become something different to take on a new identity for the sake of his people perhaps the black artist should think in the ancient tribal patterns in the terms of his people as tribal units and he being the shaman sorcerer medicine man or witch doctor the hereditary relator of tribal myths tales history and wisdom one of my most pressing problems as an alleged activist would be the effectiveness of my program northern california has not gone up in flames it is questionable whether black_power is so imminent a threat in san francisco that it covers the white power structure many of the old civil_rights activists of core and sncc have sold out or are playing house niggers for some unexplained reason to the war on poverty program so to the white man the natives appear happy with their bright new beads and baubles but perhaps this is some kind of ultra sophisticated strategy or ruse and not what it appears as handkerchief headin as a revolutionary activist my major problems are partial failure and delay in northern california we are behind the leaders of the dormant civil_rights movement are sleek bourgeoisies indulged by liberal whites and on the payroll of the establishment here it seems so easy to integrate it is so very easy to get a white girl so the leaders have kept everything cool this is not an excuse on my part that nobody seems to be listening to the revolutionaries even while black men are still being forcibly  abducted for that racist war on brown peoples in that land that hardly any of us had heard of before uncle sam decided it would be a good jumping off place into china the oakland police are the same arrogant beasts who protect the rights of whites and abuse the black man in his own neighborhoods they have not been put on the run up here even once so one of the more pressing problems that the black revolution seems little other than a paper tiger in my locale but perhaps i am wrong certainly i know the solution to this problem black unityblack unity for black_power to confront the man  are you influenced in your personal outlook by the philosophies of any other writers or thinkers yes but not always consciously to say who had or has exactly the most influence is impossible this is due partly i suspect because living in america i was greatly influenced in my formative years by white writers that i now despise or resent for reasons of their active approval of this racist society so by attempting to reject much of this early conditioning i am constantly searching for new truths and am prone to destroy my new gods rapidly i read richard wright very early and was consciously and unconsciously influenced in my creative life kafka a sad spectre of an alien culture a hero of estrangement a prophet of dying europe was an influence for i did not know myself then this was before i found the beauty and value of my own people with their heritage and history the world that richard wright depicted horrified me at first and i refused to believe in what he spoke of through his art though my eyes told me that he was a man of truth in my childhood and adolescence life was something that happened only to me and books art and movies were something outside life i refused for a long time to put them together and i did at one time accept the american dream of which her writers so gloriously spoke i was in fact at one time a house nigger and it was mainly through reading that i came to view myself in this despicable role george orwell e franklin frazier chester himes and franz fanon have had extreme influence in my development as a black man malcolm_x above all the toilet by leroi jones and whos afraid of virginia woolf by edward albee have had the most recent affect upon me as a dramatist one was created by a black man of truth showing the reality that he knows is a black american reality that many of his brothers share and the other by a white prophet of americas hypocrisy who portrays the degeneracy of his own society a man who hates his own nearly as much as any outsider can being in the middle of this century and so near the beginning of my work i can not say candidly  which writers are exerting the most influence upon me but surely they must be those whose work i am learning from whose work i use as some measure to my creation surely these writers are in the main black for this must be if i am to one day be and think completely black of course there is leroi jones but there is also lawrence neal marvin jacknon and welton smith to name a few  who are the contemporary writersthat is writers of this centurywho you feel address themselves to the key issues of the times this question seems so broad if i started from the beginning of the century i could get hungup and write a book it is more of a theme than a question to narrow it down ill only mention some few in my time with reservations i include the white proletariat writers of the thirties for i believe that they thought of the black man more in terms of a social abstraction and their manifest good attitudes toward pertinent issues came from political ideology not human motives the absurdist playwrights who are actually old men save for albee who ill include in this category though perhaps i shouldnt but lately have come into prominence i include men like beckett ionesco genet etc though i believe they would resent being listed with those concerned with issues especially social or political issues in their demonstrating the futility and absurdity of mans existence they mirrored the spiritual annihilation of their dying culture so their plays of human issues forecast the relevance of social and political issues today for a new culture is about to sweep aside theirs and the offsprings of that society today in my time i was at first anxious over the progress of baldwin now i only feel quiet hostility after suspecting that baldwin isnt writing for me or to me i keep reading ellison again and again more because i love good art and w the craft of excellent writing and jones has just found himself and his direction as have many of us and though we black writers are not thrashing the same blind and dead horses it is too soon yet to place bets on the real contenders entire schools of black writers are springing up and these are the people addressing themselves to the times in which i am concerned all of the white writers today seem to be ominously quiet  list those issues crucial to our times and comment on them the single paramount issue for the black man today is the survival of black people there are too many people in this world the white man knows this the white man can no longer economically exploit the nonwhite peoples any longer he has no need to he has cybernetics the black peoples will soon be systematically exterminated unless they unite they will go the way of the buffalo and the indian  what kind of future do you envision for the negroes in america please state why you feel as you do unless drastic changes are made in the next decade i see only death for the black peoples in america and soon following the world unless the black man in america unites he will be given concentration camps instead of integration the relocation centers might be given the euphorism of retaining or retraining camps or such to ease the fears of those whitewashed collegeeducated negroes who would hesitate to enter the fake shower rooms with their phony bars of soap i foresee black babies sterilized at birth in the white hospitals of white america i foresee blacks being assigned the status of public american enemy supreme i see death for blacks at the hands of whites here in america america has already initiated a racial war upon foreign soil and america cannot continue to have so many dark witnesses and dissidents within its house in the coming years there will be parallel revolutions here in america the revolution among the whites will come when the pronounced fascists push to the fore to save capitalism which they realize is in its last and deadliest battle socalled liberal whites and whites of goodwill will be probably shot wholesale by the fascists even before the black man can eliminate these anchors about his neck and then white america will begin the extermination of the black man and in the immediate future there will be revolutions among the black as the black peoples liquidate their socalled leaders who fraternize with and sell them out to the whites when the moderates or liberal negroes are eliminatedthen the black people can find the selfdetermination to fight against the whites the people must and will fight for their own survival and destiny blacks need power to survive and it has to be gotten in other ways than civil_rights bills and wars on poverty it must be taken through strife
let me make this clear l g i aint a writer i aint £ even a thinker i do sp end most of my time considering what the young intellectuals and wise old philosophers are saying in an attempt to make a decision about the right direction for me i am a social worker and being of an existential orientation my decision about direction must not only apply to little old black professional spinster me but to all the little children who come to my neighborhood house as well as the welfare mothers the members of the womens clubs and the teenage drop outs with babies bad marriages and always lots of doctor bills it seems that there are only three alternative goalscomplete annihilation enslavement or assimilation of white folks this is from a worldwide vantage point nationally if we are interested in survival weve got just one possible procedurethat is to become smoother sneakier more articulate toms and to teach our poorer less privileged brother to be less volitile less angry much much less emotionally spontaneous or is the word honest we must become the most adequate pleasing passive secondclass white folk we can be internationally if we american negroes endure the storm there may be a time when the options are ours as colored people to consider if it is at all reasonable in this era when morality is an issue of power to consider humanitarian goals to be valid then we must consider what it will mean in  years after the next world war and the total destruction of civilization in the process to have to deal with a minority of vulnerable dependent whites lets face it there aint a negro alive who doesnt know an ofay he would like to save when the shooting starts the problem is that for some it might be a loving mother a secret but meaningful affair a decent boss i talked with a negro woman who lived  years with a white woman and reared her daughter in the home the white woman hired a seamstress to make the childs clothes and babysit on the mothers dayoff im sure this good black woman can testify to the goodness of white folk both annihilation and enslavement would take a great toll on the moral fiber of the new society we are too accepting to start rejecting people in a total way we are lovers to the core our society must be built on love not christian love but jesus love black love is sexual aggressive demanding as well as giving tender and protective black love permits a fight but not a murder a lay but not hooking prostitution is a service for the middleclass white population it seems to me few negroes acculturated as such have ever needed to purchase sex our black_power has got to be our black love we must destroy white power with black love now lots of our performers and musicians have already found assimilation to be the best way it would appear that for the most part they are wishing for individualization right out of the negro race to the higher white side and thats not what we want then there is nothing more obnoxious than watching a black man fistfight in a bar for the purity of a white whore that is just wholesale purchase of one of the lies we must love a way that is conquering it must destroy value systems and myths and finally and maybe most important we must destroy races american negroes who are americas only melting pot wouldnt lose a thing but to suggest to the world that it rid itself of the concept of racial supremacy through complete amalgamation would be blasphemous we must not tell not a whisper but begin now before its too late the first step in the use of black love is to slap your white friend when he makes another stupid racist statement instead of becoming embarrassed and alienated the second step is to stop killing men especially other dark ones and the third step is the production of lots of brown babies and of course all will become automatic when we finally really dig love ourselves
when you purchase life insurance you buy protection for  aracj £ your family in the event of your premature death but more  ww  than this one fact you are also starting a valuable savings p rosam which is tax sheltered it is one savings program  c which because of specific provisions in the tax law permits wealth to be passed within the family and even from one generation to another completely free of income tax estate and gift taxes you should shop for insurance as you would for consumer goods rates and terms of policies are regulated by law in most states but are by no means uniform or standard one company may offer a better deal on  payment life insurance but not in term insurance a check can be made of any insurance company by calling or writing your states insurance commissioners office keep in mind that state licensing laws vary and the company that is licensed to do business in many states is a safe company with which to do business term insurance offers the most protection for the lowest premium in all but very special cases however you dont accumulate cash values many people consider it best to buy insurance at the lowest possible premium rate and invest the difference saved by buying term insurance in common stocks savings accounts and mutual fund shares one important thing to remember is that if you do buy term insurance be sure its the type that is both renewable and convertible this gives you the privilege either to renew the policy as term insurance or to convert it to a different type of policy mutual companies offer dividends to their policyholders these socalled dividends are not taxed by the government for a very simple reasonthe dividend is only a form of refund on an overcharge which brings us to the question of whether or not dividends should be allowed to accumulate suppose you are paying  per year for  endowment policy which has accumulated dividends of  available after youve held the policy for a number of years in effect you are now insured for only  because your equity in the policy is  available upon your request yet you are paying premiums for  of coverage you might be able to secure the same amount of coverage for a great deal less or you might protect your loved ones with a lot more insurance with the same amount of premium before you make a decision to cash in such a policy check what premium youd have to pay at your present age for a  term policy or what arrangements could be made to convert the endowment policy at age when taken out to a  payment life or straight life contract another factor to consider is the rate of return you are receiving for the accumulated dividends left with the company youll be amazed to learn that most companies are paying around two per cent while you can earn anywhere from  to  per cent by depositing dividends in a federally insured savings account if you suffer from a disability and consider yourself uninsurable take heart several large insurance companies have set up plans to cover cases formerly considered as uninsurable also you can try to obtain coverage in group contracts where physical examinations are not required at work or through an association or club offering group insurance to members you can also ask your present insurance carrier if you can use accumulated dividends to buy paidup insurance savings bank insurance is generally cheaper because no commissions are paid to brokers or agents generally  of the first years premium and  per year for the next nine years is paid to insurance salesmen savings bank insurance is not available in all sections of the country and even where available you wont be able to obtain the flexibility in the contracts and the options which are available from most private insurance companies gi insurance is very reasonable in price and those who do not have policies and are in a position to obtain government insurance are missing a surefire money saver if they do not take advantage of the opportunity to get back to the subject of insurance tax shelter our present laws provide that insurance contracts can be exchanged tax free there is no current tax dilution on such insurance exchanges as there is on practically every other switch of investment ie switch from one stock to another because of change in investment objectives a life insurance contract can be exchanged tax free for another life insurance contract annuity or endowment an endowment for another endowment or annuity an annuity for another annuity contract annuities are given tax protection and this tax protection continues as long as the annuitant lives on the death of the assured any gainthe difference between premium costs and lump sum death proceedsreceived by the beneficiaries is free from income tax if your surviving spouse elects to receive death proceeds in installments there will be an increased payment made to such spouse to reflect interest on the delay in making full settlement such spouse can receive not only face of the policy but also the interest factor tax free until such interest exceeds   per year insurance proceeds are not subject to income tax they are nevertheless subject to estate taxes by inclusion in the estate of the deceased even though the proceeds are payable to a beneficiary but even here there is a way out all you have to do to remove insurance policies from inclusion in the estate is to give away ownership of the policy during your lifetime this means giving away the incidents of ownershipright to cash in the policy right to borrow on the policy right to change the beneficiary right to sell the policy etc you should pricecompare to get the best available contract for the premiums paid one way you can assure this is to ask the advice and counsel of an insurance consultant these consultants give advice only and charge a fee to tell you how to make the most of your insurance premiums the consultant does not sell insurance but only offers advice and will refer you back to your own broker or agent to make any changes in your coverage health insurancein the average american family medical care has become a biggerthanever expensereviewing these costs two facts will become obvious to you first each bill by itself seems pretty high and second there are an awful lot of them what can you do about it the answer isnt to cut down on trips to the doctor dentist or optometrist the costs of adequate health care has risen tremendously during the past few decades as a nation we are spending over  billion each year on medical care or about  for every man woman and child family health costs average about  per year health economics and good health rank in importance with sufficient food adequate housing recreation and other social and economic needs and concerns of the general population especially amongst the aged voluntary health insurance is playing an important part in providing persons of all ages with health care in essence a program of health insurance is a means of minimizing the economic impact of medical care or of loss of wages through disability through the use of insurance principles which produce a fair sharing of the cost essentially this is a systematic budgetary arrangement by which a person may pay medical bills or have income continued during a period of disability in recent years the american people made new gains toward meeting the costs of their health care more than  million people carried hospital or medical expense insurance in  more than  million of these were wage earners who were insured under programs or other arrangements designed to help replace lost income during periods of disability following are some of the more popular types of coverage available hospital expense protection hospital expense benefits provided by insurance plans help pay the cost of the hospitals daily roomandboard charge and other hospital services such as the use of the operating room laboratory tests surgical dressings and drugs to help meet the rising hospital costs insurance organizations are providing larger hospital daily benefits there is also a trend to extend maximum periods for which benefits will be paid surgical expense protection surgical expense policies provide for operations performed by physicians both in and out of hospitals regular medical expense protection these policies pay the physicians fee for nonsurgical care and often help pay for diagnostic xray and laboratory expenses this coverage also pays for doctor visits to the hospital major medical expense this type of coverage provides protection against virtually all types of health expensesin and out of hospital as long as treatment is prescribed by a physician it even helps pay for costs for special nursing care xray prescriptions and medical appliances among other services insurance companies provide major medical expense protection through group plans individual or family policies many blue cross blue shield and medical societyapproved plans offering extended coverage have been included in the basic hospitalsurgicalmedical plans previously mentioned major medical plans are usually identified by three features the deductible amount the coinsurance feature and high maximum benefits the deductible is the predetermined initial amount the insured person pays of covered expenses before benefit payments begin the insurance company then pays  to  per cent of the remaining covered expenses with the insured person paying the balance called the coinsured feature benefits provided under major medical plans run as high as    or even higher the maximum amount of benefits per year under major policies can apply on a per illness or per injury basis or to the total amount of expenses for all disabilities under the group mechanism major medical expense coverage is provided either on a supplementary or a comprehensive basis on a supplementary basis protection for catastrophic conditions is provided as a complement to basic hospital surgical or regular medical expense protection already in force often an uninsured margin of medical expensefrequently called the corridor amount exists between the basic and supplementary major medical expense plans this corridor functions as the deductible in this instance under comprehensive major medical plans both basic and catastrophic protection is provided in a single plan and these plans are generally available with an initial low deductible amount such as  to  under both types the insurance company pays  to  per cent of all hospital and medical expenses above the deductible amount prescribed or rendered by a physician loss of income because of disability loss of income protection provided by insurance companies or through similar wage continuation plans helps replace income lost by wage earners as a result of disability more than threefifths of the total civilian labor force in the united states is protected against the loss of income by insurance company plans or similar formal wage continuation plans personal accident and specific dread disease insurance these policies protect against loss of income against the loss of income or expenses incurred by a specific disease eg polio policies and many provide for accidental loss of life or for dismemberment group accidental death and dismemberment insurance these policies cover most of the contingencies of the previously mentioned policies but coverage is available only to groupsemployee groups associations clubs professional groups etc  life insurance many life insurance policies provide for the payment of monthly cash benefits in the event of the policyholders total and permanent disability liability insurance home owners policies and automobile policies can contain medical expense reimbursement provisions to cover the insureds responsibility but also to cover himself and his immediate family usually these benefits are payable even if the insured is at fault workmens compensation this is to provide employees with protection against expenses incurred as a result of an onthejob accident or sickness caused by the nature of the work payments are also made for loss of earnings and for accidental death or permanent disability sick benefits four statesrhode island california new jersey and new york have compulsory laws providing for reimbursement of wage loss due to offthejob sickness or accident medical care by federal authority medical care is furnished by the government in veterans hospitals to veterans in need or veterans suffering from nonservice connected disabilities and of course from disabilities directly connected with service in the armed forces social security disability under certain conditions persons who are covered under the provisions of the federal oldage survivors and the disability insurance act can receive disability payments if they are permanently and totally disabled dental expense policies this is the latest type of insurance protection to mitigate large bills only about  persons are presently estimated to be covered by prepaid dental health plans but the idea is catching hold and more and more groups are being formed to provide this type of protection the group health dental insurance inc of new york is an example of nonprofit public plans premiums are modest a husband and wife with two children can visit a dentist of their choice and have him paid by the ghdi if he is a participating dentist for family incomes under  the dentist accepts the insurance payment as payment in full for nonparticipating dentists or where family income is over  the ghdi pays a set allowance above which the insured has to pay included in the overall dental care is xrays anesthesia and aftercare plus allowances for oral surgery all of this protection is available for only  per month dental societies in  states have started nonprofit dental service corporations as the forerunner of an overall dental insurance program the blue cross too is experimenting with the inclusion of this coverage as one of its services and is presently operating a prepaid dental plan in an upstate new york county health plans for elder citizens the insurance industry has tried to head off government intervention in the area of providing health care for the nations fast growing senior citizen population most accident and health policies have provisions for the payment of benefits caused by sickness or accident to cease at age  however this fact creates a big problem the person who is over  usually has reduced earnings and cannot stand the burden of medical expenses even those policies which continue to pay past the th birthday for disabilities commencing prior to the th birthday fall short of providing adequate protection older persons who had little chance of buying health insurance at a relatively reasonable cost several years ago now can get it regardless of their physical condition  intensive enrollment drives aimed at persons  or older have been scheduled by at least four major insurance companies during this coming year these companies do not ask any medical questions require no medical examination and either the applicant or a relative may buy the policy by mail connecticut  is perhaps the first of these plans designed primarily for the elderly who could not afford the insurance plans which were available started by continental casualty in  the plan spread from state to state so that by  the company was represented in all states buying the policy how to get the best possible health insurance policy for the premium dollar is a perplexing problem it can safely be said that no two accident and health and supplemental coverages policies are exactly alike but what you should know is that each company sets forth the premium charge for each item contained in its contracts you should also note that while companies do offer package policies they are for the most part ready willing and able within the confines of state law to plan a policy to suit your individual needs tailormade policies have an advantage in that you pay for what you want and for what you can use you are in a position to avoid paying for coverage you already have in other policies or for coverage which you do not need you pay considerably more if you want loss of income coverage for sickness to commence with the first day of sickness actually it is the extended sickness which will play havoc with your finances and an eight day or fifteen day or thirty day policy will provide protection against the loss of income for extended sickness and will cost a great deal less in premiums many today are buying their policy protection for their homes as a packagecalled homeowner forms one of the advantages to this was the elimination of duplicate coverages and a considerable savings in premiums brokers have put up super packages which contain an individuals home needs life insurance and accident and health program an opportunity is given to pay for this overall insurance program on a monthly basis by financing the premium due with a premium financing company however the trend in this direction runs counter to the advice of most moneymanagement experts who advocate the more economical annual or triennial payment of insurance premiums they frown on unnecessary borrowing especially on a highcost shortterm basis the spreading of the premiums over the year can probably be accomplished at far less cost financing charges of insurance premiums cost from  to  per cent per year if policies are grouped to effect savings and the renewal dates are staggered throughout the year and premiums are paid quarterly or semiannually thus all policies for ones automobile those for the home or apartment those for life insurance those for hospital expense accident and health would be grouped into categories and arranged with renewal dates spread throughout the entire year 
almost as if caught up y in a national fad many £ college campuses a throughout america  c are becoming populated with students who are referred to in a variety of descriptive terms including those of white liberal historically the growth of the white liberal movement closely parallels the enslavement of negroes in this country therefore this is not a new movement but an old one which hasdue to current social conditionsassumed questionable importance the major questions which this analysis raises are related to the social and political implications of the modern white liberal movement do the modern white liberals have the same firebrand leadership quality as those in wendell phillips era or are they instead ideological miscarriages incapable of moving from utopian theory into democratic action basically it is the quality of their social action stuff and not the quantity that will occupy our thoughts it should be noted at the outset that many of the comments pertaining to the white liberal are also appropriate for his counterpart the negro liberal towards a definition the words white liberal are emotionally toned symbols which evoke a variety of images ranging from bearded sandaled grade school dropouts to cleanshaven expensivelyshod college presidents all of whom frequently lock arm in arm in order to walk down a street and sing we shall overcome somewhere between these caricatures we may find a more representative group of people upon whom we can attach the label white liberal levistrauss observed that in any society it is inevitable that a percentage  of individuals find themselves placed as it were outside of any system or between two or more irreducible systems the group asks and even requires that these individuals represent certain forms of compromise which cannot be achieved on the collec  tive level that they simulate imaginary transitions and embody incompatible systhesis one of the few points that observers like levistrauss can agree upon is the marginality of the white liberal he is at best in an ambiguous position between two contrasting ethnic groups he is a member of the oppressors seeking to help the oppressed rhetorically he stands between two different and often conflicting cultures armed with hope and what at times seems to be an unsatiable ideal the american dream david danzig writing in commentary identified what he perceived to be two schools of white liberalism  one whose ultimate goal is the gradual absorption of deserving negroes into white so ciety and  one whose ultimate goal is equal rights of all people based upon their status positions in his excellent book the negro mood lerone bennett jr refers to institutional liberals such as certain labor and religious groups and administrative liberals especially social workers and governmental agency executives other writers place the white liberals on a continum with the philosophically wellgrounded altruistic liberal at one end and the confused but wellmeaning and ofttimes dangerous dogooder at the other end borrowing from aaron antonovskys excellent redefinition of the marginal man we may define the white liberal as follows a member of the dominant culture in terms of power and reward potential who seeks to facilitate the movement of members of a less dominant culture into the dominant culture power or powerless is the white liberal an intermediary between the socalled negro community and the white power structure thereby being able to successfully negotiate racial equality howard zinns book the new abolitionists builds a strong case for this position and louis lomax implied as much in the negro revolt the negro is committed to action if the white liberal will use his power and influence to ready his people for honest orderly response the child of change will be born with less pain less hysteria and less loss of blood on the other hand saul alinsky ralph bunche and james baldwin seem to reflect a growing view that the white liberal is but a powerless inept follower in the white community alinsky referred to white liberals as having the tendency to leave the civil_rights struggle when a fight begins ralph bunche once called them mawkish missionaryminded sentimentalists and baldwin asserted that there is no role for the white liberal he is the negros affliction perhaps the greatest criticism of the white liberal is that he is not a liberal but a moderate in philosophical disguise while the white liberal may have membership in the dominant culture it also seems probable that he often lacks power to provide negroes with the much needed social and political boots for an operation bootstraps of equality his liberal actions frequently are interpreted as being somewhat uncle tomishand indeed tend to alienate nonliberal whites including those in power positions jews in particular are disproportionately highly represented in civil_rights activities but disproportionately lowly represented in the white power structure in addition many jewish scholars have been accused of using the negro cause as a means for gaining academic acclaim and financial renumeration its a sad day a disgruntled negro leader frowned when the foremost negro experts are not negroes but jews the precarious position of the white liberal is further undermined by negro patterns of reverse segregation robert penn warren who speaks for the negro charles silberman chrisis in black and white and lewis killian and charles grigg racial crisis in america wrote about many negroes feeling that the presence of white liberals in their organizations are preventing them from achieving racial equality they feel that the sitins prayins marches and other civil_rights activities should be allnegro productionswritten produced directed and acted by negroes still other negroes feel that most white liberals are neither prepared nor willing to assume roles less than top leadership the number of white directors and negro assistant directors in civil_rights or human relations agencies give weight to this fear how come an angry negro civil_rights demonstrator asked the writer whenever we want to complain to the man he always brings in a handful of company negroes who aint even directing themselves not to mention their departments ironically often whites who assume positions of leadership in negro organizations tend to lose touch with both the white power structure and also the other members of the white community such leaders become negroized losing their marginal position and moving into the less dominant culture the negroized white liberal looks like sounds like and suffers like negroes on these rare occasions the white liberal does not have to ask what it is like to be a negro if pressed to generalize about the modern white liberal this writer would say that he the white liberal is but a shadow of the man many civil_rights goals have been lost by the intervention of the white liberal of course many other activities have been won by such intervention however it seems that his lack of complete acceptance in either culture greatly limits the intermediary role of the white liberal and bolsters the cry for black_power new directions a more effective role for the white liberal probably will emerge when the latent anxieties of whites and negroes are subjected to a frank open dialogue it is time to move away from the eternally nice but superficial conversations the goals roles and extent of involvement of both whites and negroes engaging in the civil_rights struggle should be frankly discussed specifically how much does each participant expect to become involved and under what conditions the lack of sincere dialogue is not unique to the modern civil_rights struggle as early as  negro freedmen lamented save us from our friendswe know understand and can cope with our enemies we have named them we have them under control it seems axiomatic that total   commitment to equality of opportunity for all people is mandatory for the white liberal however total commitment to all civil_rights activities is not mandatory everyone need not march pray picket or go to jail conversely some activity beyond intellectual vociferation seems needed in order to assure the negro masses that the white liberal is not all show and no go this activity as an illustration can be as magnanimous as not fleeing from his neighborhood when negroes move in or the equally supportive act of correcting erroneous remarks made by friends a clear delineation of his projected role at the outset would minimize role inconsistencies of the white liberal by so doing he is less likely to be accused of lacking real commitment to civil_rights as he openly ponders his next move the white liberal is categorized as being a friend of freedom who pauses and hesitates it is this hesitation that caused alinsky to prefer being called a white radical rather than liberal what seems to be but a play on words does in fact get at the esssence of the functional value of the negrowhite partnership in the civil_rights struggle because it is a fad for many white citizens the liberal cause is adopted after all this is an activity about which they can tell their chilldren and grandchildren so they join civil_rights groups without a clear idea as to what they are willing to do this basic uncertainty is compounded by such questions as how they should talk act and dress these then are the confused but wellmeaning dogooders whom we mentioned earlier others join civil_rights causes because of a clear belief in and definition of their roles unfortunately too few white liberals seem to be of this vintage thus it is not the philosophically wellgrounded white liberal who has become the model for the white liberal stereotype but the confused dogooder at this juncture it should be repeated that many of the comments pertaining to the white liberal are appropriate for his counterpart the negro liberal
i watched a  itu  s roup of people enjoy  rvw t a performance by comedian bin  cosy i was impressed with the humor of the man but i noticed a very curious thing the members of the group seemed to enjoy him even more than the basic humor of his material seemed to warrant after the show i asked one of my white friends why hes just a very funny guy thats all i wasnt satisfied with this and so we discussed the whole thing in more detail at one point it developed that my friend thought that cosby was funnier than dick gregory when i inquired why the answer was just funnier i mean hes really funny just funny theres no race stuff to his material so that was it and that seems to be it with people all over america when it comes to dick gregory what my friend meant was that dick gregory made him think this facet of dick gregorys personality is his greatest contribution to his profession and to his culture of course i dont feel i need mention the fact that in all likelihood there would not have been any bill cosby without dick gregory but there have been other comics who have caused us to thinkwill rogers for example but the difference is that gregory makes us think about the most inhumane sordid unjust ugly social political and economic phenomenon in americainequality but more than that the man worms his humor down into our conscience and makes us squirm none of us likes that except those who are doing all they can to help solve the problem the reason my friend enjoyed bill cosby over and beyond the natural humor of his presentation was the fact that here was a negro comic at last who was funny and didnt remind him about selma jackson birmingham indianola etc his relief manifested itself in the extra show of appreciation and deliverance he mustered in his laughter my friend is not alone in this this same guilt is displayed by others for example a few years back the late nat cole had a very good television show that folded because the madison avenue boys claimed they couldnt get backing for the show now cosby comes along and with less than a years time in the big time he is given an opportunity to appear in his own series my point is that cosby is being welcomed with open arms because he represents a relief to the consciences of people after gregorys constant bombardment against the state of racial affairs in america they can wave cosby around and say see were doing our part but gregorys scathing remarks not only affect the consciences of whites they raise havoc with negroes also he is a constant reminder of what a negro can and ought to do many negroes like whites would like to put their head in the sand and wait until the storm blows over this attitude can best be exemplified in the comment im too violent to be involved in a nonviolent demonstration but gregory has an answer for them baby if you look up and see one of them big mississippi sheriffs with his big revolver cattle rod dog and rope youll become nonviolent as hell and it wont take long either then there is the guy who says i have a good job i have a family to support gregs comment how in the hell do you think you got that job baby i lose more money in missed engagements in a month going down there than you make in a whole year now the negro has his back to the wall just like the white person because greg not only preaches it he practices it there is a possibility that the reason that greg has all of the answers is because he knows all the questions how did he come to know all of the questions and the excuses because he too had his head hidden at one time his head was in the clouds my acquaintance with greg goes back to  i remember that my first impression of him centered around the fact that he had tremendous drive and ambition only one thing mattered to greg and that was to make it this monomaniacal drive was not only commendable but was also very wise because that was the only way a poor black man could make it but somewhere between the time greg was struggling to make it and the time he made it something happened to his own attitudes perhaps it was the fact that although the mayor of his hometown gave him a welcome home parade there were places there where he couldnt even go to eat perhaps it was because he could stand up on the stage and entertain a thousand people but there were some who would not and could not entertain him in their homes maybe it was the realization that he could have a thousand dollars in his pocket the admiration of millions and the acquaintance of the head of state and yet be reduced to something less than a man by some bum calling him a nigger like most people who have been converted greg is devout and intense in his newfound faith having come from the side that makes excuses he makes it his most urgent business to now be just the opposite thats why he hits so hard and effectively he can anticipate the rationalizations of others because he used them himself at one time understanding how they think and feel and understanding fully the crisis that exists he can penetrate and pain more than most his constant pinpricking of the american conscience has caused something of an antigregory cult to arise i dont expect that it will be easy for greg to continue to be the conscience of his audience im sure hes aware of the fact that some of his fans have dropped away because he refuses to let them relax and shrug their shoulders about the race problem he by his own actions shows them how and what to do he says do as i say and do as i do but i dont believe that greg has the inclination nor desire to cross back over to the complacent let martin_luther_king do it category he is in a very strange position for he serves as something of a barometer of race relations in america for if america accepts him it will be because her conscience is clear if she rejects him it will be because she cannot afford to have him constantly reminding her of her gross failure its something of a shame that america should need someone like dick gregory but its extremely fortunate that there was someone like gregory ready and able when the time came
the negro creative writj f i £ er in the united states  i t is in an unenviable position if he like white writers chooses as his raw material his own experiences and the life reverberating around him he is likely to find only halfhearted acceptance from editors and publishers it will make little difference how well he writes or how fresh and sharp his vision if he treats his material with honesty and holds onto his own integrity what he writes will strike even sympathetic whites as accusatory if on the other hand the negro writer chooses to follow the line of least resistance guarding his work from telltale implications of his own racial identity he may find a kind of success but he is unlikely to fulfill whatever potential he possesses for artistic achievement and this is so simply because no man reaches the summit of his own potential through the conscious denial of who he is and of the forces which have formed him many negro writers have failed because they sought to write as writers not as negro writers not understanding that in a racist and segregationist societyas the american society inherently is their claim to being merely writers and not negro writers has no meaning at all for if their subjects are negroes then the facts of life in america will dictate that the racism and segregation be dealt with in one way or another and if their subjects are whites it is altogether probable that white writers know them better and can present them with more clarity depth and honesty these negro writers failed because they sought to do the impossible and their failure is understandable the critics and the editors and the publishers told them and tell negro writers even now that the reading public which is predominantly white has little interest in negro problems and more damaging still that there is nothing universal in the negro experience in his introduction to the anthology american negro short stories hill  wang editor john henrik clarke says of the negro renaissancewhich covered the years between  and  that it was the richest and most productive period in negro writing in the united states perhaps this is so but if it is then it also means that the negro renaissance was not very rich and productive at all by objective standards but for the reasons already advanced this fact does not surprise after all the work turned out by the writers of the negro renaissance had to find publishers and publishers did not fall over themselves rushing up to harlem claude mckay that excellent poet of the period struggled valiantly to keep a literary journal alive in the end crisis and opportunity the nonliterary organs of social units floated by white funds provided the only somewhat continuous outlet for negro writing and so if relatively few negro writers of short fiction or any fiction came to prominence it is understandable yet on the evidence of mr clarkes anthology and of two other anthologies due for early publication negro writers continued to turn out short stories many of excellent qualityover the years two of the new anthologies mr clarkes and one edited by langston hughes and called the best of negro short stories little brown  coare in fact surveys of negro short story writing over the past century the anthologies contain stories by charles waddell chestnutt and paul laurance dunbar who were writing before the turn of the century and stories by the negro renaissance era writers claude mckay arna bontemps eric waldron jean toomer sterling brown rudolph fischer and langston hughes himself the two anthologies include works by a number of writers whose productive periods bridged the gap between the negro renaissance and the new era ushered in by the searing essays of james baldwin among these names are zora neale hurston dorothy west ted poston carl ruthven oftord john p davis arthur p davis john caswell smith and katherine dunham also represented are the talented writers who gained recognition in the wake of richard wrights success with his first explosive novel native son these writers are chester himes ralph ellison willard motley owen dodson ann petry and john oliver killens both anthologies feature short stories by frank yerby the single negro author who found a formula for fiction and stuck to it with great financial success other writers who gained eminence in the late forties and in the fifties and who are represented in the clarke and hughes anthologies are gwendolyn brooks mary elizabeth vroman paule marshall frank london brown alice childress alston anderson james baldwin john a williams and john henrik clarke himself the negro writers of the sixties some of whom are contributors to the new anthologies promise a ringing challenge to john henrik clarkes contention that the negro renaissance was the richest and most productive period in negro writing in the united states already this group of young writers have produced a stunning body of work and many of them have only begun their careers the john a williams anthology beyond the angry black was published several years ago as a paperback and the revised hard cover edition published by cooper square will have one deletion a ralph ellison excerpt and several additions it is not precisely an anthology of short stories and not all its contributors are negroes but the emphasis is on short fiction the younger negro authors in the williams anthology are james baldwin junius edwards s p lomax gloria c oden and carrie allen young others are gwendolyn brooks chester himes langston hughes margaret walker and richard wright white contributors to the williams anthology are john howard griffin the late shirley jackson abram kardiner and lionel ovesey seymour krim dennis lynds john w mcreynolds and paul olsen the hughes and clarke anthologies boast fine new writers who have been read principally in little magazines notably negro digest among this group are martin j hamer conrad kent rivers ernest j gaines pearl crayton mike thelwell and woodie king jr the new and powerful writers of the sixties whose works are in the clarke and hughes anthologies are ronald l fair lerone bennett jr william melvin kelley paule marshall ronald milner robert boles kristin hunter charles wright ernest j gaines and leroi jones all of these writers also have produced novels or books of essays plays biography and history completing the entire list of authors represented in all three new books are loyle hairston alice walker sylvester leaks albert murray charlie russell r j meaddough iii clifford vincent johnson cyrus colter hoyt w fuller and lindsay patterson only a few of the stories are famous the hughes anthology reprints this morning this evening so soon one of the finest of james baldwins fictional works the anthology also includes frank yerbys short story health card which won an o henry award and launched mr yerbys career the clarke anthology includes a sketch it is not really a story by the late great w e b du bois whose career as novelist essayist historian polemicist and bibliographer spanned several generations before his death in ghana on the eve of the march on washington the hughes anthology features a story by the legendary jean toomer often called the best creative writer cane of the negro renaissance period the fairskinned mr toomer apparently stopped writing and rumor has it retired to a country squires life in rural pennsylvania for those who have never read or have forgotten richard wrights early story of black and white communists in mississippi in the thirties bright and morning star will prove a revelation all the power and anger of the writers great talent leap out from the pages and seize the reader and it is not protestas the critics have labeled it it is a great bitter moving story it is reprinted in mr clarkes anthology of the newer writers those who seem to most effectively have mastered the art of short fiction are ernest j gaines paule marshall william melvin kelley and martin j hamer but then they are all good writers period and three of them have published excellent novels the stories in the three anthologies range all over america the west indies europe and africa and there is no single guiding rule by which they may be measured they are in fact as rich and varied and complex as life itself taken together the stories and articles and poems in beyond the angry black the best of negro short stories and american negro short stories tell more about the history of negroes in americaand of their relationship with whites than shelves of volumes of history and sociologyhwf
i recall upon meeting m b tolson at the fisk writers conference last spring asking him if he accepted the label given him by karl shapiro the poet who writes in negrowell my boy he answered youll see this afternoon and his generous smile although halfteasing was like his voicewithout a trace of condescension it was certain that the afternoon would affirm what i had surmised one sensed in the dancing eyes that guided his finally weary frame not mere longevity but rare vision and a sense of life his presence was gently humbling evoking joy pride and a most exact anxiety the way he said my boy with such warm affection lingers yet not inspired by me personally i think but rather an extension of the warmth shared by thousands of young black people whose fortune it was to be counted among his students suddenly i felt cheatedculturally deprived yesthat i had not been one of them and moreover cheated because m b tolson had in fact been hidden from me as shapiro has written a great poet has been living in our midst for decades and is almost totally unknown on sunday august   dr melvin b tolson poet laureate of liberia distinguished professor of the humanities at tuskegee institute was taken from us succumbing to a long battle with cancer my heart was saddened but amid the sadness there is gladness in the realization that my heart however briefly was among those touched by m b tolson the word charisma comes to mind but not unlike other words that come to mind is insufficient in capturing the spiritgiving force conveyed by tolson a man whose absence from our minds and our lives while with us is but another chapter in this unspeakably bitter travail i recall an associate in a telephone conversation saying to mr tolson we need you it was a fitting tribute to a man whose works speak profoundly of his  years for me meeting m b tolson was like experiencing a contemporary nat turner a man whose message to black people could not be encouraged
