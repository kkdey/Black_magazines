problems and prospects 
by frederick oneal
or a number of years negroes were not allowed to perform on the legitimate stage in america negro characters were played by white actors in blackface down through the years casting patterns in the various entertainment media have changed to some extent but not very much during the period roughly between  and  negro stars such as bert williams and others were spotted in white shows as if they were so super special that they had to be shown in almost wholly unrelated roles and mostly alone they were just the darlingest quaintest oddest most interesting sexiest most exotic or in other words just about the best thing in the show but not really a part of it the most common method of handling the negro actor in the straight play was to cast him exclusively in socalled negro roles which inevitably meant in some servile capacity such as the maid butler cook etc let it be clearly understood here that there is nothing wrong with servant and comedy roles per se the criticism stems from the characterization presentation and interpretation of these parts which until recently took the form of lazy shuffling characters speaking a dialect that even negroes had never heard the types of roles played by negroes are more of a barometer than the number of these roles the negro actor feels that he is grossly discriminated against in the casting of shows in all of the entertainment media surely his talents could have been used in many parts in a manner that would not have distorted the artistic concept of the production indeed in many instances it would have enhanced such values it would seem that negroes and orientals are the only groups whose roles are circumscribed by race the irish actor can play a japanese character the jewish actor can play the indian german actors play italian characters and vice versa but the negro actor only has a chance of being cast if the part specifically indicates negro the imagination of the agent casting director play director playwright or manager preoccupied with timeworn casting patterns does not extend beyond the racially designated description in the manuscript but these same individuals have no difficulty whatsoever with their imaginations when it comes to the selection of perhaps a david wayne for the part of the japanese character sakini in teahouse of the august moon or of jeff chandler as an american indian now all of this may sound strange and contradictory when we realize that by and large people of the theater have been opposed to discrimination segregation and other forms of bigotry and hypocrisy actors equity association is the union which has jurisdiction over those actors dancers and singers who work in the legitimate theatre the council its governing body includes seven negro members and one officer among the seventytwo members for almost twenty years equity and the league of new york theatres the organization of theatrical producers have worked in cooperation with other elements inside as well as outside the theatre community to make this area of entertainment free and healthy the league equity the dramatists guild and other organizations and individuals have on more than one occasion joined together to defeat the threat of official censorship during the dark days of mccarthyism the antiblacklist committee in actors equity working with the league managed to keep the theatre relatively free from political persecution and the principle of guilt by association as a result of this kind of cooperative effort the theatre has remained the most free of all entertainment media while being ever mindful of its collective and individual responsibility and obligation to the public served in the mid s washington d c was one of the most lucrative stops on the touring theatre circuit but the management of the national theatre in that city maintained a policy of racial discrimination the league and equity pleaded with the management to drop this vicious and immoral policy and when this request was refused these two organizations together with members of the dramatists guild decided to refuse bookings in this or any other theatre in washington until such time as the management could see fit to change this policy this was in  the national theatre remained closed for the next five years while touring shows played the gayety theatre a former vaudeville house that had dropped this discriminatory policy the national was finally remodeled and redecorated under a new management and reopened in  with a welcome to all races and nationalities on a completely nondiscriminatory basis inasmuch as washington was just about the most segregated city in the united states at that time perhaps it was this collective action that broke the dam of prejudice and bigotry releasing the first wave of such changes that have taken place in that city since  it was a healthy action that could only terminate in a wholesome result since  by contractual agreement equity does not permit its members to work in any theatre where segregation and discrimination are practiced inquiries are often made of the union as to the number of negroes there are among its  members due to the fact that the racial background of members is not indicated in the unions records no one actually knows some say a thousand or more others maintain that the figure is much lower equitys ethnic minorities committee has made an unofficial effort to determine the number of negro members of the union by inquiry among members both negro and white as to their knowledge of all negro actors known to them as members of equity after examining a number of lists submitted we found a great deal of duplication but from this somewhat unorthodox method we learned that the figure is around  there may be negro artists who are members of other performing unions such as american guild of musical artists american federation of television and radio artists american guild of variety artists and screen actors guild actors equitys jurisdiction is only over those actors singers and dancers who perform on the legitimate stage in the united states and canada such jurisdiction also includes some industrial shows a few night club shows musical theatres summer stock etc each year many young negro and white actor hopefuls knock on the doors of producers they all look forward to a successful career in the theatre many inquire as to the chances for such success such chances vary somewhat according to the individual but on the whole they are pretty much the same for whites as for negroes except that the chances of those of high visibility are diminished or complicated by the existence of color a great deal of the imagined interest in and fitness for a career in the theatre is occasioned by the very rare freak success of a newcomer to the profession such a case is usually accompanied by reams of news stories and in some instances they are stories not really about a newcomer but about a well trained and experienced actor or actress being given a publicity buildup and the newcomer tag is but a useful gimmick unlike many other professions it is very difficult to establish oneself in the theatre there are many heartaches disappointments and frustrations in some cases this has led to mental instability the american negro as a whole has plumbed more levels of society economic religious political etcthan any other comparable group such experiences are of particular value to the negro actor especially in contemporary drama where more restrained portrayals are demanded however as in the classics we have not fared too well such style demands dedicated study and effort far too many members of the profession black and white have aligned themselves with the generally accepted lay opinion that one does not have to study in order to become an actor or actress within the last few years that segment of the profession has dwindled considerably and to the point where we now have a fairly large group of competent young actors and actresses who are ready for almost any assignment if the negro actor aspirant will remember all this and also that his chances of success are further complicated by the fact that he is a negro then i would suggest he secure a copy of the book opportunities in acting by dick moore published by universal publishing and distributing corporation in the vocational guidance manuals series it was written in answer to the many questions asked by those who are seriously considering acting as a career the prospects for the negro actor in search of a career in the theatre are further lessened by the fact that many producers feel the socalled negro show is not a good financial risk as theatrical investments go compared to investments in white shows they seem to forget about many successful negro shows which have been produced for years one could include among them such plays as green pastures shuffle along porgy and bess carmen jones and emperor jones anna lucasta still remains among the alltime record holders for broadway runs of straight plays paul robesons othello holds the alltime record for the broadway run of a shakespearean play even with the bad judgment exercised by some producers in their selection of negro plays it is quite possible that an objective survey would indicate that there is a greater proportion of success among these negro shows based on the total number produced than white shows under similar circumstances the availability of stars also plays a great part in the decision of producers the legitimate stage has not peculiarly enough developed many negro stars not one of the current crop of luminaries was developed by the theatre and yet plays have been shelved for lack of a competent available negro star of sufficient magnitude to head such productions this does not mean that negro actors are not available who could do just as well or possibly better than the desired stars but the precarious economic position of the commercial theatre does not allow for such experimentation in some lay circles the term star has been used rather loosely to the extent it has lost a great deal of its former meaning except to those producers theatrical investors and others who still know and respect the true meaning of the term frequently actors are referred to as having starred in this or that play when in reality the parts played and the billing if any given these actors are not even comparable to feature recognition in the trade the word star is applied to an actor or actress who has reached a stage of artistic development to the extent that they can lend favorable influence to the box office potential once such personalities have attracted a considerable public following they are in the contractual position to demand that their names now synonymous with a well desired trade mark be placed above the title of the play or directly beneath it in very large letters true in many cases this position is not well earned but such rewards are not without consideration for commercial values opportunities for negro actors in the legitimate theatre are so few it is seldom if ever they can grow steadily to the point where they can reach the star category the legitimate theatre has been forced to borrow negro personalities that have been developed in other media many a star has found his original medium more lucrative though and cannot afford the occasional luxury of doing a play or musical top boxoffice attractions such as lena horne and sammy davis are not always available and quite often the roles to be filled are not suited to the particular talents and personalities of this small group since the employment of negro stars usually means the employment of negro supporting players whenever a play is shelved or abandoned it follows that a number of negro actors have been denied a chance to develop towards the star circle this boxoffice draw of such stars as miss horne and mr davis was demonstrated in their last appearances on broadway both appeared in plays that did not receive very favorable critical comment yet miss hornes vehicle jamaica and mr davis mr wonderful had runs of more than a year mr davis latest musical golden boy is still running at this writing and playing to full capacity each week with no end in sight despite not too favorable reviews without a doubt such plays would have closed long since with lesser names this would be true of shows with white stars as well the existence of the star system today is largely due to the desire of the producer to exploit that which he feels creates in the potential theatregoer a desire to fork over the price of admission in this respect he has created what he now terms a frankenstein essentially a stars success is related to the stars ability to attract customers to the boxoffice the figures on the employment of negroes during the past season  as compared to previous seasons are somewhat interesting during the above period the total employment of negro actors on and offbroadway dropped considerably from that of the previous season  the total number of jobs filled by negro actors reached a new high during the  season figures for the last five years are as follows      number shows with integrated casts on bdwy  offbdwy  jobs available on bdwy offbdwy number shows employing negroes on bdwy offbdwy the drop in the total number of jobs available to negro actors during the season  as in certain other past periods is mainly due to the number of shows produced with predominantly or allnegro casts for example during the  season three shows porgy and bess  tambourines to glory  sponono  accounted for  of the total number of  employed that year this was all but  of the total that same season offbroadway three shows jericho jim crow  ballad for bimshire  and cabin in the sky  accounted for all but  of the total employed in that area a total of  shows were produced on broadway last season and  during the   season the most important figures are those under the heading number of shows with integrated casts these figures indicate parts played by negroes that are not designated by the author as socalled negro parts where race is not thematically necessary to the story and not so directed as to imply racial identification it will be noted that these figures have held up pretty well and in fact increased somewhat in addition to the increasing number of negro artists being used in nonracially designated roles another encouraging factor is the number of negro playwrights whose works have been produced in recent years all of them are not necessarily new playwrights but with the possible exception of langston hughes they are new to broadway and offbroadway such writers as james baldwin leroi jones lorraine hansberry deceased louis peterson ann flagg adrienne kennedy errol john ossie davis william hairston loften mitchell alice childress irving burgie abram hill and william branch have been presented to broadway or offbroadway during the past ten or fifteen years the works of  of these writers have been produced during the past five years some of these new playwrights might be classified in the angry young man category who sometimes forget that the primary requisite for a good play is its ability to entertain it must first get and hold the attention of the audience if this is not done one might as well be talking to oneself surely there is a place in the theatre for ideas convictions points of view but the craftsmanship and technique of playwriting must be employed to express these ideas and convictions in terms of good theatre for a number of years the negro writer seemed to approach his work out of a peculiar psychological or doctrinal fixation that is his work takes on a conscious or unconscious protest it is very difficult for him to develop or summon forth that degree of confidence selfassurance and inner dignity to approach his work without a certain degree of emotional preoccupation and sometimes that same emotional preoccupation destroys craftsmanship and technique the result is that the literary work suffers dr alain locke wrote in  as follows propaganda pronegro and antinegro has scotched the dramatic potentialities of the subject negro drama especially with the few negro playwrights has the propaganda motive worked havoc they have had the dramatic motive deflected at its source race drama has appeared to them a matter of race vindication and pathetically they have pushed forward their moralistic allegories or mellodramatic protests as dramatic correctives and antidotes for race prejudice today however the negro playwright having become aware of his potential strength in the battle for full citizenship has been able to overcome a certain amount of this emotional preoccupation the result is and will be that his work will take on a higher degree of technical perfection and literary value in addition to the established and promising negro playwrights there is further reason for optimism occasioned by some degree of progress in other areas in recent years one or two stage managers have emerged such as charles blackwell formerly of david merrick productions and now working with harry belafonte james wall working in a similar capacity in television irving vincent maxwell glanville currently playing a role in golden boy and one or two others the work of two negro directors was seen on broadway during the past season frank silvera directed amen corner as well as coproduced the play with mrs nat cole and lloyd richards was represented by the musical i had a ball and he will direct another show this season other negro directors who have directed on or offbroadway during the past two seasons are osceola archer edward cambridge and vinette carroll donald mckayle has established himself as one of the top flight choreographers having served as assistant choreographer for west side story red head and more recently as choreographer for golden boy albert popwell directed the dances for the revival of south pacific at the new york city center others of this group are katherine dunham walter nicks talley beatty and alvin ailey in addition to frank silvera and mrs nat cole irving burgie ellis haislip and ossie davis can be added to the list of negro producers this group as well as the negro playwrights can be very instrumental in expanding opportunities for negroes in the american theatre george mcclain has worked in several management capacities and is now assistant manager of the st james theatre he has served as company manager for several large productions on prebroadway tours dick campbell was company manager for the langston hughes show tambourines to glory and for ballad for bimshire he is currently working for crossroads africa the product originated by rev james robinson and after which the peace corps was patterned one of the more successful talent agents is ernestine mcclendon who holds franchises from all of the major performer unions her clients include almost as many white artists as negroes there is a growing use of negro musicians in the pit orchestras of broadway shows and since the desegregation of the new york locals of the stage hands union negro craftsmen are working the broadway theatres perry watkins veteran negro scenic designer has also produced on broadway he is currently working with duke ellington on his new show civil_rights organizations are beginning to realize that the negro creative artist and particularly the playwright and actor exert the greatest influence in the establishment of the negro image conferences are currently being held with the naacp in the hope of establishing an naacp national performing artists advisory committee as a permanent department within the national office with a staff person on both the east and west coasts to pursue on a continuing basis the ultimate objective of complete desegregation of the performing arts  
the flight from broadway 
by ossie dav
hen i came to harlem in  i joined a flourishing comv munity theatre sponsored by dick campbell and muriel rahn the rose mcclendon players where i got my basic training as an actor and as a playwright it is impossible for me to imagine having had any kind of meaningful life in the theatre without this training and i feel this must have been true for most of the student performers whom i met and worked with there the rose mcclendon players was a community theatre in the true sense of the word it cultivated and serviced the harlem community with highgrade theatrical entertainment which gave negroes a chance to see their own lives reflected on stage at least four plays a season to a subscription audience it gave burgeoning negro playwrights a chancewhich they could get nowhere elseto see their plays mounted and performed and it gave negro actors stage managers set designers and assorted technicians a chance to learn and to practice their craftunder the best instruction with the coming of world war ii the rose mcclendon players disbanded but its work was taken up and advanced by the american negro theatre founded by frederick oneal and abram hill ant as it came to be called was even more intensive and extensive in its operations and from its roster has come such theatre people as oneal himself ruby dee sidney poitier harry belafonte hilda simms earle hyman max glanville and a host of others it is difficult to imagine the american theatrical scene as we know it today in the absence of these performers it is equally difficult to imagine they could have made such an impactive contribution had they not had a theatre workshophad they not had antat which to learn and to practice their craft no further argument is neededit seems to meof the indisputable and irreplaceable value both to actors and playwrights etcand to the harlem community itselfof a community theatre but harlem had had no significant community theatre since ant closed up shop in  why i think the decisive answer is that broadway discovered ants production of anna lucasta in  and gobbled it up that i believe was the beginning of the end for suddenly there was a place downtown on broadway for negro actors the end of a war fought in part against racial intolerance had come and broadway decided to introduce a new concept of the negro to the american public plays like deep are the roots jeb strange fruit on whitman avenue and later native son all followed anna lucasta and most of the functioning cadre of ant joined the march into the theatrical mainstream there was effort from time to time to fall back and regroup to keep the old establishment going out of the blood sweat and tears of those who remained to the end but it was hopeless the suction the sweeping undercurrent flowing towards broadway only a subway ride away was irresistible and a great community theatre so absolutely essential to the spiritual life of the community passed away almost without protest many regretted its passing who felt that a certain tone a certain richness had gone out of the lives of our people and who sought in various ways and at various times to build up another theatre to replace the one that had flown away on the wings of success but the times were against the idea integration the movement of the negro people outward from their ghetto confinement into the mainstream of american life and culture that was the objective too long had we negro actors playwrights directors etc fought to get onto broadway and been by and large denied too long had we been forced to stand on the outside looking in now that the doors were open at lastor so we thoughtwe must make every effort to move through to stop now and devote any of our time and energy to building a theatre in harlem would be to look backwardsin effect to resegregate ourselves after years of struggling to breakdown segregation no one can deny that integration has come to broadway that though much remains to be done the negro is now included meaningfully in most aspects of broadway life certainly he will not find any statutory limits or barriers to his activities the negro is accepted in a way that was unthinkable prior to anna lucasta but accepted into what broadway itself is in a spiral of inflated production costs which makes it more and more difficult for theatre to dare try and make a real contribution to american culture and rising ticket prices that drive more and more people away from its doors every season and while the negro actor playwright director etc can still look to broadway as an arena for the gainful exercise of his talent that arena itself grows smaller and smaller as every year fewer and fewer plays make it to broadway at all and fewer and fewer of that few survive beyond the first week and what of the negro community or in more up to date terms the negro audience can it hope to have its own spiritual and cultural requirements met on broadway as they formerly were met by the rose mcclendon players and the american negro theatre now when the submerged aspirations of the negro are beginning to surface in a more and more disturbing and revolutionary fashion a la watts can broadway as it now liesslowly dying of economic strangulation its voice essentially inaudible on the burning issues of our time vietnam watts poverty crime mississippi etcreally speak to the needs of the negro community or any other community in the thirties broadway was a cockpit where significant ideas were fought and bled over today it is on television that mccarthy and his ism came a cropper or that south vietnam at last manages to engage the attention of the nation it is a motion picture like dr strangelove that brings us face to face with the realities of atom power politics and even more significantly it is to our novelist and writers of essays that we turn now for serious discussions of our social plight what playwright or play is more relevant to the major turbulences of our timesor can command a larger and more attentive audience than james baldwin and his essays leroi jones and his poems or john o killens and his novels tobacco road was about rural poverty among whites it was of another time and quite successful as good theatre and as social comment such a play of our times about urban poverty among negroes and puerto ricans might do equally well on both counts but plays about negroes especially unpleasant plays about negroesie baldwins blues for mr charlie do not make money what producer knowing todays costs of production would want to risk offending his audiences sensibilities at todays ticket prices incidentally mr baldwins amen corner which was not unpleasantin that it did not make the predominantly white broadway audiences feel guilty was not successful true lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun did make money but her sign in sidney brusteiris window did not my own play purlie victorious stayed on broadway seven and a half months and can be counted an artistic success but phil rose our producer ruby and i had to take money out of our pockets to keep it there    money we never got back another play offbroadway in which i was associate producer ballad for bimshire an excellent musical also failed what i am trying to say is that while there are no impediments to plays about the truth of negro experience being produced on broadway such productions so far have not succeededhave not been hits in the sense that anna lucasta was the negro community can find its anguish and its joys mirrored faithfully and profitably in books in magazines and in the news on television but on broadwayno dice the great hope that we would be included into the mainstream american theatrethe hope which led us to abandon our own independent community theatre in harlemhas been realized in form but defeated in substance what shall we do we negroes about our needs for living theatre both as performers and as member of the negro community i think we must first realize what is happening to broadway broadway as we know it is changing theatre is becoming decentralized and americans will in the future look less and less to broadway as the endall and beall of drama just as we no longer look to hollywood for what is of real consequence in motion pictures we too must move with the timesand we are community theatres and repertory acting companies are springing up in various places bent more on serving the needs of their own communities than on trying to imitate broadway a tremendous proliferation of nonbroadway oriented theatre groups is taking place all over our country i am myself a member of the founding committee of the american negro theatre inc which aims to secure foundation grants to build a theatre in harlem already kenneth whitlock with his prospect park summer theatre robert hooks and barbara ann teer with their group theatre workshop roger furman and his new heritage theatre and leroi jones and his black arts theatre are beginning the flight from broadwaythe long trip back home surely we shall see a new community theatrenot only in harlem but in all american communitiesnot yet but soon old habits die slowly and broadway was and is still one of the sentimental landmarks in american culture  will hate to see it lose face i will hate to see the sceptre pass to other places than new york but broadway grows less and less able to satisfy the cultural needs not only of the nation but even of new york city itself i believe that we being negroes have a special thing to say to ourselves and to the world of our own daily lives which only theatre can express and  believe we have a special need to celebrate the rediscovery of our people which only the theatre can fulfill potentially nobody can make more spiritual capital out of the coming decentralization of the theatre than we canand no other groups need it more than we do broadways loss is bound to be harlems gain at least i hope so and i want to be there when it happens 
in search of the revolutionary theatre 
by leroi jones 
revolutionary the atre should force  ii  change it should be change  ah their faces turned into the lights and you work on them black nigger magic and cleanse them at having seen the ugliness and if the beautiful see themselves they will love themselves we are preaching virtue again but by that to mean now what seems the most constructive uses of the world the revolutionary theatre must expose show up the insides of these humans look into black skulls white men will cower before this theatre because it hates them because they have been trained to hate the revolutionary theatre must hate them for hating for presuming with their technology to deny the supremacy of the spirit they will all die because of this the revolutionary theatre must teach them their deaths it must crack their faces open to the mad cries of the poor it must teach  anyone names except common sense the revolutionary theatre should flush the fags and murders out of lincolns face it should stagger through our universe correcting insulting preaching spitting craziness    but a craziness taught to us in our most rational moments people must be taught to trust true scientists knowers diggers oddballs and that the holiness of life is the constant possibility of widening the consciousness and they must be incited to strike back against any  agency that attempts to prevent this widening the revolutionary theatre must accuse and attack anything that can be accused and attacked it must accuse and attack because it is a theatre of victims it looks at the sky with the victims eyes and moves the victims to look at the strength in their minds and their bodies clay in dutchman ray in the toilet walker in the slave are all victims in the western sense they them about silence and the truths could be heroes but the revolu   lodged there it must kill any god tionary theatre even if it is wesern must be antiwestern it must show horrible coming attractions of the crumbling of the west even as artaud designed the conquest of mexico so we must design the conquest of white eye and show the missionaries and wiggly liberals dying under blasts of concrete for sound effects wild screams of joy from all the peoples of the world the revolutionary theatre must take dreams and give them a reality it must isolate the ritual and historical cycles of reality but it must be food for all these who need food and daring propaganda for the beauty of the human mind but it is a political theatre a weapon to help in the slaughter of these dimwitted fatbellied white guys who somehow believe that the rest of the world is here for them to slobber on this should be a theatre of world spirit where the spirit can be shown to be the most competent force in the world force spirit feeling the language will be anybodys but tightened by the poets backbone and even the language must show what the facts are in this consciousness epic whats happening we will talk about the world and the preciseness with which we are able to summon the world will be our art art is method and art like any ashtray or senator remains in the world wittgenstein said ethics and aesthetics are one i believe this so the broadway theatre is a theatre of reaction whose ethics like its aesthetics reflects the spir itual values of this unholy society which sends young crackers all over the world blowing off colored peoples heads in some of these flippy southern towns they even shoot up the immigrants favorite son be it michael schwerner or j f kennedy the revolutionary theatre is shaped by the world and moves to reshape the world using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world we are history and desire what we are and what any experience can make us it is a social theatre but all theatre is social theatre but we will change the drawing rooms into places where real things can be said about a real world or into smoky rooms where the destruction of washington can be plotted the revolutionary theatre must function like an incendiary pencil planted in curtis lemays cap so that when the final curtain goes down brains are splattered over the seats and the floor and bleeding nuns must wire soss to belgians with gold teeth our theatre will show victims so that their brothers in the audience will be better able to understand that they are the brothers of victims and that they themselves are victims if they are blood brothers and what we show must cause the blood to rush so that prerevolutionary temperaments will be bathed in this blood and it will cause their deepest souls to move and they find themselves tensed and clenched even ready to die at what the soul has been taught we will scream and cry murder run through the streets in agony if it means some soul will be moved moved to actual life understanding of what the world is and what it ought to be we are preaching virtue and feeling and a natural sense of the self in the world all men live in the world and the world ought to be a place for them to live what is called the imagination from image magi magic magician etc is a practical vector from the soul it stores all data and can be called on to solve all our problems the imagination is the projection of ourselves past our sense of ourselves as things imagination image is all possibility because from the image the initial circumscribed energy and use idea is possible and so begins that images use in the world possibility is what moves us the popular white mans theatre like the popular white mans novel shows tired white lives and the problems of eating white sugar or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing white businessmen of the world do you want to see people really dancing and singing all of you go up in harlem and get yourself killed there will be dancing and singing then for real in the slave walker vessels the black revolutionary wears an armband which is the insignia of the attacking army  a big redlipped minstrel grinning like crazy the liberal white mans objection to the theatre of the revolution if he is hip enough will be on aesthetic grounds most white western artists do not need to be political since usually whether they know it or not they are in complete sympathy with the most repressive social forces in the world today there are more junior birdmen fascists running around the west today disguised as artists than there are disguised as fascists but then that word fascist and with it fascism has been made obsolete by the word america and americanism the american artist usually turns out to be just a superbourgeois because finally all he has to show for his sojourn through the world is better taste than the bourgeois    many times not even that americans will hate the revolutionary theatre because it will be out to destroy them and whatever they believe is real american cops will try to close the theatres where such nakedness of the human spirit is paraded american producers will say the revolutionary plays are filth usually because they will treat human life as if it was actually happening american directors will say that the white guys in the plays are too abstract and cowardly dont get me wrong    i mean aesthetically    and they will be right  the force we want is of  million spooks storming america with furious cries and unstoppable weapons we want actual explosions and actual brutality an epoch is crumbling and we must give it the space and hugeness of its actual demise the revolutionary theatre which is now peopled with victims will soon begin to be peopled with new kinds of heroes    not the weak hamlets debating whether or not they are ready to die for whats on their minds but men and women and minds digging out from under a thousand years of high art and weakfaced dalliance we must make an art that will function as to call down the actual wrath of world spirit we are witchdoctors and assassins but we will open a place for the true scientists to expand our consciousness this is a theatre of assault the play that will split the heavens for us will be called the destruction of america the heroes will be crazy horse denmark vesey patrice lumumba but not history not memory not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our despair these will be new men new heroes and their enemies most of you who are reading this

lmost everyone in the western hemisphere has heard of sir laurence olivier the great english actor who has starred in the theater and on motion picture screens but who pray tell is james earl jones the two namesone so famous the other practically unknown came into juxtiposition last year when life magazine ran a review of an offbroadway production of othello which featured jones in the title role coincidently sir  laurence was and at this writing still is playing the same part in a british revival of the ancient play lifes reviewer compared the acting styles of the two men and concluded that jones more than held his own with his completely individual completely absorbing portrayal of the moor of venice in one respect at least sir laurence was laboring under a handicap which several earlier critics had pointed out being white he had to resort to some rather eyestopping and from the critics point of view distracting blackface makeup to more properly assume the role of othello who was a negro jones had no such problemhe is a negro james earl jones is  years old is a little on the heavy side although hes tall which compensates for this and has what many theatergoers and reviewers acknowledge to be a most incredibly striking face one that is massive and almost biblical in appearance because of the thick bushy beard that curves around it thick black eyebrows top off this imposing combination of facial features and lend to jones an air of intensity that is just right for the moor of venice he is a bachelor who lives in a messy tworoom flat in new yorks lower east side and his one interest appears to be acting indeed this young man seems to eat sleep and live acting and it is possible just possible that someday his name may be as wellknown as sir laurence olivier at the present however jones is just one of several dozen very talented actors who are littleknown in the new york theater world bobbing about in lowbudget productions and waiting to be noticed by top producers unlike his struggling colleagues though jones is more than satisfied to be where he is at this particular point in time in a profession famous for its stars this is one man who is seriously pursuing his career by acting and studying and who professes that he is totally uninterested in the tinsel glamour that accompanies the hollywood brand of stardom a glance at his theatrical record reveals the deliberateness and purpose that mark his budding career he has had a string of roles which taken together comprise a fine apprenticeship in the theater he has run the gamut from comic roles such as the whimsical cannibal hired to eat the heros motherinlaw in the love nest to more serious portrayals such as the dignified prince of morocco in the merchant of venice and the older brother in the cool world which played briefly on broadway before being made into a film yet despite these and many other parts jones is in no hurry to make a name for himself each week he takes the subway to the actors studio to sit in as an observer on study and criticism sessions and on monday his day off from the theater he is usually in the audience of current plays looking analyzing and even enjoying despite all of this activity and  experience this tall handsome actor still must face the obvious question of just how far a serious dedicated negro can go in the american theater below the star level of people like sidney poitier and lena horne and sammy davis jr there are dozens perhaps even a few hundred negroes in show business who exist in a large gray area where nothing ever seems to happen beyond a hardly noticeable role in an occasional play or film is it possible to break out of this area to bigger and better parts jones refuses however to view the theater strictly from the viewpoint of being a negro opportunities for actors in general could be better he saysand means it this is not to say that jones is completely unaware of the color of his skin far from it there are always little incidents that serve to remind him that he is a negro a few years ago for example he was playing the part of the bombadier in the motion picture dr strangelove in the tense climactic scene in which the american plane is rocked by a soviet missile jones was being carefully instructed by the director stanley kubrick kubrick told him to look upward in fright at the moment of the explosion with the camera very low looking up at me jones recalls i thought to myself sonofabitch this guy wants me to roll my eyes if it wasnt kubrick i wouldve said are you trying to get a stepin fetchit effect or something actually i think he almost wanted that effect he wanted simply to suggest it to awaken in the observers mind the particular image of the negro in trouble an even more subtle complication of his being a negro as it relates to the theater is that joness skin is of a medium shade and his nose is slim and conservative in appearance thus when he comes on stage the audiencewhile naturally recognizing him as a negro may find itself more readily able to identify with him than with a darkerskinned actor the writer of a play in which he was understudy to the lead once approached him and told him jimmy i think that if you were out there the audience might identify better with the character the actor in the lead naturally was several shades darker than jones while he may have his sensitivities about being negro there is no question that jones is proud of what he is i dont want to go on stage and eliminate my negritude he says flatly i think theres something so exciting about being what you are whether its being seven feet tall or black or blonde that you shouldnt want to disguise it or pretend it isnt there many white liberals who have applauded the recent trend toward casting negroes in parts that would normally go to white actors or actresses such as ruby dee playing cordelia in king lear will be drawn up short by joness attitude toward this development he does not want to be so integrated into a play as to lose his identity as a negro jones definitely wants parts that are meant to be played by negroes only he has set up an inflexible condition that an audience must recognize him for what he is a black man and then it must accept him this way he is interested in exploring and developing his blackness and in using it unashamedly in the theater ive always wanted to play mephistopholes and emphasize all of his black aspects he says for all of these conditions and demands on an audience jones is resignedat least for the present to the fact that it takes theatergoers a few minutes to get used to him as a negro before it can accept him as a character in the play they never really identify he says but they come much closer to it the deeper into the character i get as an actor i found that people cry watching othello in the moment of his agony and at that moment they necessarily have to forget what he is even bull connor would cry watching othello in spite of himself its that deep psychic defense that people have thats a hard thing to crack it keeps them from accepting negroes in certain capacities to illustrate what he means jones summons up the story of the time he was sitting in a movie theater watching a newsreel about the korean war when a scene flashed on the screen showing american soldiers both white and black in action together a woman sitting nearby jones suddenly jumped up and said in very shocked tones to her companion they dont have negroes in the front lines one need go no further than the television set to see this kind of mentality in action jones believes he points out that tv commercials are a field that is now opening up to negro actorsif they are the right shade theyre trying to do token integration he asserts take a soap commercial lets say its important for the producers to show a negro woman using smiths soapflakes well its almost as important not to have her so specifically negro that anyone couldnt identify with her you recognize the shade and thats the token as a negro in a profession that makes strenuous physical and mental demands on those who pursue it jones has more than once been confronted with the conflict of making a choice of which comes firstcivil_rights or art occasionally he is able to successfully combine one with the other as when he participated in a taped television program about the three civil_rights workers who were murdered in mississippi not long ago it was during this taping that he was confronted with yet another manifestation of the same basic dilemma one of the men in the television studio who had been working with the student nonviolent coordinating committee approached him and tried to talk him into going into the south and working for civil_rights there jones reluctantly turned him down i think if i went down there he says i would have to devote myself to it totally and if i did that i dont think i would take the choice that james foreman or martin_luther_king takes i think i would take the choice of malcolm_x to cope with that situation there is need for that kind of pressure rather than the moral pressure because morality is long gone the more militant black leaders who say that the solution is economics in the north and force in the south are right i mean for now maybe some day morality will be the solution i dont know the curious thing about jones is that even while he is talking about the oppression of negroes in america there is no bitterness in his voice it is as if he were talking about oppressors he has heard about but never met almost in the same breath he will say i dont know what christ was talking about but he was onto something his conviction that malcolm_x had the right approach to the race conflict may even be somewhat explained by his interest in the assassinated black nationalist as a dramatic character id like to perform malcolm_x he says id like to explore with an audience and a director and other actors that phenomenon that was called malcolm_x this last statement isnt surprising when you understand that jones looks on the theater as a pressure chamber where invisible forces froth and boil over indeed it is possible that for him as for other dedicated actors an understanding of life is acquired on the stage in that electric moment when there is that unity of spirit and concentration between actor and audience in that moment when the spark of life leaps from a script jones says that he cannot go onto the stage to pretend to be someone hes not at the same time he may often go before an audience and discover in the character something of himself which until that moment lay below the threshold of his awareness apart from these abstractions of exploration and discovery jones is concerned with the more downtoearth techniques and tools of his profession he is a hard worker for his role in othello he steeped himself in the maze of theories hypothesized by shakespearian scholars to explain the personality of the darkskinned general jones has learned that an actors concentration can be one of his most useful tools gene frankel a new york director and drama teacher taught me that he says concentration on what youre doing on stage on your part is largely responsible for involving your audience you can even be doing bad work but if your concentration is strong enough theyll watch your bad work rather than their dates or the people in the next row i can sense their involvement when my own involvement in the part is strong enough if im too busy watching to see if ive got them i dont get them its like zen its a yoga of acting you do it and then you know it its a matter of total commitment along with these techniques jones has also developed a philosophical attitude toward assessing the value of his own work which other actors might envy there are neither successes nor failures he says i think ive committed myself as best i could to everything ive done if an artist looks at himself objectively he wont see himself in terms of success or failure thats usually for somebody elses judgment joness ambition is to be a great actor that is to be able to play a particular role better than anyone else who had the same kind of talents and skills in an offmoment once jones admitted my life is sort of funny in a way i go around as if the sky could fall in on me at any moment although so far it hasnt lately he hasnt had much chance to check the sky hes too busy making a living in the theater 
the tattered queens
by ruby dee
hen  about w  i first learned the death of dorothy dandridge a tremendous sadness came over me id known her slightly only really over the years our paths had never crossed in workoccasionally socially but i had seen her mostly as an actress and remembered with joy her beautiful performance as carmen in the movie carmen jones i felt i knew her as well as i knew myself    what as a young performer she aspired to what she had to settle forthe active search for opportunities the sporadic success the long periods of nothing to look forward to the deliberate pretense of indifference the deep selfdoubt a major role then waiting waiting    she was lucky for her career as an actress began with a head start as a singer and between the betweens she could fill club dates how fortunate not to be just an actress i wondered if the tragedy of dorothy was not indeed the tragedy of all negro actresses i worked with an actress once in a huge theatre in the bronx in a playarsenic and old lace i had vaguely known of her what style she had i recall thinking what grace i wondered where she had been trained there was something about her personalitydistinctly royal profoundly human she might have played any role from a queen to a peasant representing any race her name was abbie mitchell she had worked with some of the leading talents of the early s she had been acor country abbie mitchell cicely tyson claimed here but mostly in europe an extraordinary soprano a prima donna i felt fortunate that our lives had touched at the time of our meeting i was quite young and coming along well for a colored girl at the time i believe that often young performers lacking a continuity of experience lacking a knowledge of history of entertainment of the tradition and great contribution that our people have made to the theatre may tend to feel that a whole new world begins with each newcomer not so inspired by abbie mitchell i began to read books about and by negro performers i am deeply grateful to such people as james weldon johnson tom fletcher and edith isaacs for having written on the subject it was through their books that i began to feel a sense of belonging somewhere as an actress  as part of a tradition id almost missed knowing abbie mitchell where was her scrapbook where was there a more complete description of her life couldnt my husband ossie davis write her story as a play why didnt  talk to her more ask her what it is like to reach the top is there a top for negro actresses why wasnt she as well known and as frequently employed as the leading white performers of the time retired why what would she play next it was some years later by then after talking about her after asking other older performers who came out of retirement about her i finally wrote her asking for an appointment the letter came back unanswered unopened it was marked deceased rose mcclendon and the famous walk down those stairs even ethel barrymore complimented her for it with kindness that comes only from being white regularly employed and nationally recognized who was she had she worked in more than the half a dozen plays id seen referred to where was there a record of her accomplishments i remember tall sensitive edna thomas why dont i see her on television sometimes or broadwayon or off retired now perhaps but because she wants to be it seems that negro actresses enjoyed a fuller creative life in the old community theatre eg the allnegro lafayette players such actresses as edna thomas hilda offley evelyn ellis and laura bowman knew and benefitted from working in stock companies they had a chance to more fully explore the depths of their talent they were not primarily restricted to plays about negroes one may be extremely talented but only constant exposure makes a performer stageworthy and cameraworthy i never heard of a negro starlet with a seven year contract learning the ropes in b movies and studio schools quite a few moderately talented white actresses have blossomed into fame and fortune under such attention what might have happened to dorothy dandridge with a sevenyear contract and the security that goes with it we actresses are so accustomed to the fact that performers such as ethel waters lena horne beah richards pauline myers jane white hilda simms and claudia mcneil have no part in television or work regularly in stock that we stop trying we hear talk of integration and things getting better and indeed there are some marvelous integrated commercials and more negro actors appearing in incidental parts and every now and then racially mixed leads and an occasional allnegro show but these are isolated instances not a trend indicating that things may be somewhat better in an individual sense group participation in the creative life of the country is less than ever we cannot grow in isolation the negro actress is still acting on the fringes not really a part only occasionally let in better off portraying the prostitute the second roles written with not enough imagination and truth we can point to no one of us who has the remotest chance of reaching the prominence of helen hayes ethel barrymore bette davis etc no one with that kind of economic opportunity either we dream we scream we pretend we picket or like some other of our most gifted mildred joan smith muriel smith marion douglaswe quit will the newer names on the horizonlike cicely tyson and diana sands and gloria fosterescape the paucity of opportunity that always seems to follow occasional spurts of comparative good fortune for colored stars when we talk or write about ourselves and our place in american society so much is necessarily a lament but perhaps a look at stark reality may help clarify and make objective our grievances indicate alternatives to despair through some program of action i fully realize the cultural poverty that is abroad in the land leading white actresses are afflicted by some of the same ills that affect the negro actress their lowest level of employment is however often commensurate with our highest there are many more parts written for men than women white and black but my concern here is with the negro actress who faces double discriminationthat of sex and that of race what must we do we negro actresses to be saved we must most certainly make a determined effort to encourage our playwrightsparticularly female to write for all media there is a kind of autocracy about an entertainereach one sort of spinning around in a personal orbit on individual momentum i maintain that we actresses must concern ourselves more with the fate of each other and of the younger actresses coming along by helping to find material and getting it produced by promoting scholarships for intensive training we must also see to it that the new theatres springing up over the country include negro actors as basic and intrinsic parts of their companies indeed the future of the theatre may lie in repertory companies and on the road in the past musicianssingers and instrumentalistsfared better in relation to their art than we have they have been for the most part innovators and pacesetters top money and opportunity however still go to their white imitators innovators in song dance and language theirs is a development springing from the soul roots of our people but that same soul roots truth of the lives of our people has yet to be explored in drama we know best on stage and screen the prostitute the negro maid as a person rather than a stereotype the negro mother the average woman and the middleclass woman have for the most part yet to be dealt with in depth this holds true of the heroines of our history also we must ask our playwrights to do better by us we do have as a people an address to life a cry a joy that is particularly ours that has yet to be fully and unselfconsciously put forward women must become producerspioneering and prospecting among our own for backing i am particularly gratified at the work done in this connection by maria cole and juanita poitier we must see to it that our young people consider the very important backstage and olfcamera roles as technicians more people see films than ever go to the theatre if one of the purposes of art is to effect change we must make every effort to become proficient in every phase of film making working for inclusion in american films at every possible level the reality is that we are but  per cent of a population which is geared to segregate and to discriminateimproving i believe but desperately in need of artistic  effort to help change the image of the negro and so effect social change more quickly as art not only reflects life but also influences it we must dedicate ourselves to the improvement of life and its truthsabout women about negroes the negro actress cannot afford to be isolated from this effort we must not evade the fact that in todays america most negro stars are at best tattered queens haunted always by an aura of tragedy failure and defeat but we must not be defeated with a sober look at what is happening with us today we must make every effort to make things better for those who will come after us and i would especially encourage those young women of my race most likely to be overlookedthe very black the very africanesque to study and to work i believe they have shied away from theatre because their particular kind of beauty has not only not been encouraged but has been heretofore too often rejected but how else can a people know its own beauty except that those artists most representative of it come forth and tell it the fairskinned those nearer to caucasian in appearance and manners have always fared better in our theatre but are we not basically of african descent in the better times to come there will be equal place on our stage and screens for all shades all types all colors we must see to it that this is so 
theatre the negro in and out
by james baldwin
t is a sad fact that i have rarely seen a nej gro actor really well  used on the american stage or screen or on television i am not trying to start an artificial controversy when i say this for in fact most american performers seem to find themselves trapped very soon in an iron maiden of mannerisms somehow the achieved record falls below the promise henry fonda for example is one of the most accomplished actors around but i find it very difficult to watch him because most of the roles he plays do not seem to me to be worth doing moreover it would seem to me that his impulse as an actor is very truthful but the roles he plays are not his physical attributes and his quality of painful halting honesty are usually at the mercy of some mediocre playwrights effort to justify the bankruptcy of the american male eg the nebbish with whom he so gallantly struggles in two for the seesaw the point is that one can attend the broadway theatre and most of the offbroadway theatre all season long without ever being moved or terrified or engaged the spectacle on the stage does not attempt to recreate our experiencethus helping us to deal with it the attempt is almost always in the opposite direction to justify our fantasies thus locking us within them now the figure of the negro is at the very heart of the american confusion much of the american confusion if not most of it is a direct result of the american effort to avoid dealing with the negro as a man the theatre cannot fail to reflect this confusion with results which are unhealthy for the white actor and disastrous for the negro the character a white actor is called on to play is usually a wishful fantasy the person not as he is but as he would like to see himself it need scarcely be said therefore that the situations the playwright invents for this person have as their principal intention the support of this fantasy the caine mutiny court martial a majority of one tea and sympathy and tall story are all utterly untruthful plays the entire purpose of the prodigies of engineering skill expanded on them is to make the false seem true and this cannot fail finally to have a terrible effect on the actors art for the depths out of which true inspiration springs are precisely the depths he is forbidden to reach i am convinced that this is one of the reasons for the nerve wracking busyness of our stagekeep moving maybe nobody will notice that nothings happeningand the irritating self indulgent mannerisms of so many of our actors in search of a truth which is not in the script they are reduced to what seem to be psychotherapeutic exercises listening to actors talk about the means they employ to justify this line or that action is enough to break the heart and set the teeth on edge sometimes the actor finds that no amount of skill will justify or cover up the hollowness or falsity of what he is called on to do this is where the director comes in it would seem that much of his skill involves keeping everything moving at such a clip and to have so many things happening at once that the audience will remain in effect safely protected from the play if this is true for the white actor it is unimaginably worse for the negro actor the characters played by white actors however untruthful they may essentially be do dependon the accumulation of small very carefully observed detail thus chester morris playing a thoroughly unreal father in blue denim yet mimics the type so well that it is easy to be misled into believing that you once knew someone like him but the characters played by negro actors do not have even this advantage white people do not know enough about negro life to know which details to look for or how to interpret such details as may have been forced on their attention to take one of the many possible examples the scene in reginald roses black monday in which juano hernandez is beaten to death hernandez plays a janitor in the deep south you will remember who is opposed to integration he does not believeso he informs a marvelously mocking and salty hilda simmsin pushing himself in where he is not wanted he is also telling this to his twelve year old grandson who is beginning somewhat improbably to wonder if he is as good as white people now of course we have all met such janitors and such negroes but their tone is very different and their tone betrays what they really feel however servile they may appear to be there is always a murderous rage or a murderous fear or both not quite sleeping at the very bottom of their hearts and minds the truth is that they do not have any real respect for white people they despise them and they fear them they certainly do not trust them and when such a man confronts his nephew or his grandson no matter what he says there cannot fail to be brought alive in him envy and terror and love and hate he has always hated his condition even though he feared to change it even though he may no longer be able to admit it if the playwright does not know this as on the evidence i gather mr rose did not he cannot draw the character truthfully and the actor who plays him is seriously handicapped this shows very painfully in the scene in which hernandez meets his death his reaction to the effigy of a hanged negro in spite of all mr hernandezs skill is false this is not the first time he has seen such an effigy and if he has been living in that town all his life it is simply not possible for the white people there to surprise himat least they cannot surprise him by being wicked or by being afraid they have always been that and he knows that about them if he knows nothing else any negro facing in such a town three overheated white boys knows what he is in for he can try to outwit flatter cajole them put them at their ease by humiliating himselfthough at this point the spectacle of his humiliation is probably not enough to set them at their ease or if the chips are really at last thank heaven down he can resolve to take one of them with him and even if all the foregoing guesswork is wrong one thing remains indisputable once attacked he would certainly not be trying to get past his attackers in order to go to work not on that morning not in that school not with death staring at him out of the eyes of three young white men all of the training therefore all of the skill which mr hernandez has acquired to say nothing of his talentfor it took a vast amount of talent to bring lucas in intruder in the dust aliveis here not merely wasted which would be bad enough it is subverted sabotaged put at the mercy of a lie for the wellspring on which the actor must draw which is his own sense of life and his own experience is precisely here what mr hernandez cannot use if he had it would have torn the scene to pieces and altered the course of the play for the plays real intention after all is to say something about the integration struggle without saying anything about the root of it if you will examine the play carefully you will find that the only really wicked people in the play are wicked because they are insane they are covered therefore and the crimes of the republic are hidden if we get rid of all these mad people the play seems to be saying well get together and everything will be all right the realities of economics sex politics and history are thus swept under the rug    now the negro actor after all is also a person and was not born two seconds before he enters the casting office by the time he gets to that office he has probably been an elevator boy a cab driver a dishwasher a porter a longshoreman his blood is already thick with humiliations and if he has any sense at all he knows how small are his chances of making it in the theatre he does a great deal of acting in the casting office more probably than he will ever be allowed to do onstage and whatever his training he is not there to get a role he really wants to play he is there to get a role which will allow him to be seen it is all too likely that he has seen actors inferior to himself in training and talent rise far above him and now here he is once more facing an essentially ignorant and uncaring white man or woman who may allow him to play a butler or a maid in the show being cast he dissembles his experience in the office and he knows that he will probably be lying about it onstage he also knows why it is because nobody wants to know the story it would upset them to begin analyzing all of his probable reactions would take all of the space of this magazine and then some but resentment is compounded by the fact as a negro actress once observed to me that not only does the white world impose the most intolerable conditions on negro life m they also presume to dictate the mode manner terms and style of one s reaction against these conditions or as a negro playwright tells it explaining how ketti frings came to adapt richard wrights long dream for the stage she was sitting by this swimming pool see and reading this book and she thought this would make a perfectly darling play so she wrote the first few scenes and called out her negro butler chauffeur and maid and read it to them and asked now isnt that the way you poor downtrodden colored people feel about things why yes miss frings they answered and i thought so says the playwrightand so we go on and on and on the point is that the theatre is perishing for the lack of vitality vitality humanly and artistically speaking has only one source and that source is life now the life actually being led on this continent is not the life which we pretend it is white men are not what they take themselves to be and negroes are very differentto say the very leastfrom the popular image of them this image must be cracked not only if we are to achieve a theatre for we do not really have a theatre now only a series of commercial speculations which result in mammoth musicals and daring plays like compulsion and inherit the wind which are about as daring as a spayed tomcatthis image must be cracked if we intend to survive as a nation the negroinamerica is increasingly the central problem in american life and not merely in social terms in personal terms as well i intend from time to time in discussing the theatre to return to this point for  think the time has come to begin a bloodless revolution only by a more truthful examination of what is really happening here can we realize the real aims of the theatre which are to instruct through terror and pity and delight and love the only thing we can now do for the tired business man is to scare the living daylights out of him both the albee plays at the york theatrethe death of bessie smith and the american dreamleft me rather waiting for the other shoe to fall both plays seemed to promise more than they delivered but i am not at all certain that i know what it is that they promised this is not by the way meant as a complaint or as a joke i dont mindin the theatre at any ratehaving my cozy expectations swept out from under me and im the type that enjoys being forced to ask myself just what the author had in mind i was hardly ever moved to the heart as we say by either of the albee plays but i was mystified enraged amused and horrified i dont know if you will like them or not but i think you ought to see them to take the plays in the order in which they were presented the death of bessie smith takes place in the deep south much of it in a thoroughly demoralizing hospital there is not a single attractive person in this play unless one excepts the offstage bessie smith and the goodnatured but simpleminded type who takes her on the journey which ends in her death neither bessie nor this man have much to do with the main action of the play there is a question in my mind as to whether they really do much to illuminate it but we will discuss this in a moment in the course of the play bessie smith dies offstage and this is the extent on the surface anyway of herconnection with this drama the plays principal concerni thinkis with the character of a white southern nurse character is perhaps not quite the word i want rarely has less character been presented at greater or more unsympathetic length i hesitate possibly because i am a coward to suppose this creature is intended in any way to represent the fair ladies of the south and yet she is clearly of no interest in herself except clinically and i must add that as i watched her my own memories of southern faces came flooding back bringing with them the nearcertainty that this horror this emptiness might very well be what the southern faceand particularly the faces of the womenhide i imagine that anyone who is old enough will not fail to be reminded of the faces and the personalities of the women who accused the scottsboro boys of rape we first encounter this woman with her fatherand they deserve each otheron the porch of their home she is icily and methodically and not for the first time they certainly have nothing else to talk aboutpuncturing his delusions as to his person his political ambitions and his friendship with the mayor who is a patient in the hospital where she works on the admissions desk the relationship between the father and daughter is absolutely unspeakable as are almost all the other relationships in this play but  i was puzzled as to what precisely mr albee wished me to make of it it is a relationship which like the character of the nurse is really of no interest in itself it being doomed by the lack of resources in the people to be static they will have this conversation over and over then they will die or the curtain will fall and what either we or they have learned in the meantime is a question it may be that mr albees intention was to reveal as forcefully as possible the depth of the southern poverty and paranoia and the extent of the sexual ruin but if this is so then i think he has miscalculated    i sympathize with him in the dilemma to which his raw material his personages have drawn him i am an american writer too and i know how it sets the teeth on edge to try to create out of people clearly incapable of itincapable of selfexamination of thought or literally of speechdrama that will reveal them but the solution is not to my mind to present these people as they see themselves or as they are we must be enabled to see them as they have been or as they might become otherwise we merely judge them as specimens and feel nothing for them as human beings it has perhaps never been more difficult than it is now to illuminate the person beleagured and bewildered by the irresponsibility and provincialism and worship of mediocrity which he in his innocence mistakes for democracy on the other hand it has possibly never been more important so that i do not object to the deadly hysterical stasis of the nurse but to the fact that mr albee never forces me to identify her inhumanity her poverty her terror with my own for in essence the passionless brimstone exchanges which open the play are the play the tone never changes and we never learn very much more about the nurse or the other people in the play or about the community in which the action takes place there is an arresting sequence between the nurse and a negro orderly but i must confess that the intention here was hopelessly muddled for me by the castingi could not tell at once whether harold scott was playing a white man or a light negro and when it was clear that he was playing a negro i found myself distracted by the question of whether any negro in the deep south would so expose himself to this white witch i did not know what to make of the interne a dull type at best it seemed to me and whatever sympathy i might have been expected to feel for him was demolished by his incomprehensible passion to take the nurse to bed whatever for this leaves i believe only the brief appearance of another wonderfully distracted nurse the offstage bessie and her last paramour and here again either i have totally misunderstood mr albees intention or he has miscalculated i expected at some point in the play some ruthless flash which would illuminate the contrast between the wonderfully reckless life and terrible death of bessie smith and the whited sepulchre in which the nurse is writhing but this does not happen bessie smith bleeds to death the nurse is the only character who knows who she is earlier her father had protested her addiction to nigger musicand the nurse succumbs to hysteria she announces that she too can sing and horribly tries i think i understand mr albees intention here all right but i think it fails of its effect because there is no agony in it people pay for the lives they lead and the crimes they commit and the bloodguiltiness from which they flee whether they know they do or not the effort not to know what one knows is the most corrupting effort one can makewhich the nurse abundantly proves but the anguish which comes when the buried knowledge begins to force itself to the light which must be what is happening to the nurse upon the death of bessie smithhas driven countless thousands to madness or murder or grace but certainly far beyond hysteria the american dream turns out to be the gelded youth so admired here and now it presents a much more bland and amusing surface but can scarcely qualify obviously as a funny play its vision of the antiseptic passivity of american life and the resulting death of the masculine sensibility makes it more closely resemble a nightmare i cannot synopsize this play which offers even less in the way of story and even more in the way of incident than bessie smith it begins at a marvelous clip making its deadly observations with a salty impertinent speed ive got a right to all your money when you die says mommy to daddy because i used to let you lie on top of me and bump your uglies daddy needless to say has long since given that up but it goes flat about halfway and finally surrenders much too quietly i came away with the feeling that it was a far better play than the author realized and that he had given it up much too soon or that both plays were exercises notes for work which mr albee has yet to do i imagine that he will find it necessary to do much more violence to theatrical forms than he has so far done if he is to get his story told it is possible that what i am really complaining about here is a certain coldness intrinsic to albee which will always mar his work but i doubt this for one thing the venom which has gone into the portaits of the nurse in bessie smith and the parents in american dream does not argue too great a detachment but too indignant a distaste and he has a strange way with language a beat which is entirely his which may be controlled by the head but which seems to be dictated from the guts

wo small negro boys stood on the sidewalk as another passed by one said he believes people are prejudiced against him because of his color the other boy asked how can we convince him its not worth the effort the boy replied you just cant teach some people to hate this comic scene was observed by thousands of americans from philadelphia to oakland calif for the first time in the past decade of tense civil_rights conflicts and for that matter at any time in americas history people are invited to laugh withnot atthe trials and tribulations of the negro in the funnies it is a rare occasion indeed nothing has been more sadly neglected in the field of cartoon humor than the negro the door was opened by berkeley california cartoonist morrie turnerthe first negro to be syndicated in the funnies

morries humor in hue his characters all childrenone negro boy wears a confederate capbounce with life and welcome freshness satirizing the foibles of the american negro and the realities of his relationship with the white man the humor of wee pals carries the knockout punch of a prizefighter the philosophical wit of charlie schulzs peanuts and morries own special brand of love and humor he quickly points out that it will not be strictly devoted to negroes but will deal also with the injustices of all minority races as soon as i learn how to draw an indian without using a feather  its humor involving integration comments cartoonist dave berger i think its a terrific potential for newspapers says one newspaper editor morrie turners wee pals says what all of us feel but have been afraid to say with humor i dont believe editors are ready to accept this thing turner says perhaps negro humor is not yet ripe for public acceptance as morrie believes but he cannot discount the overwhelming response already by his readers perhaps also morrie says if newspapers were more competitive they would be more willing to give wee pals a chance morries humor charades life with embarrassing and honest realism the youngster who wears the confederate cap was introduced in a sequence carrying a confederate flag in front of two other boys one turns to the other and says obviously american history is not a required subject of the kindergarten class as a cartoonist morrie constantly seeks out his own selfconfidence in each daily strip i die a thousand deaths over each idea as he puts it a selftrained graphic artist morrie toys with each new situation often concerned that it will  be understood and liked maybe i worry unnecessarily how others will take it he says many of his faithful fans and close friends often see something else in the scenes and their own interpretation helps them to identify with the characters as wee pals comes to life in americas newspapers they became a living institution for morrie sometimes it seems like they come to life and almost draw the strip for me he explained even though his multiracial cast of children go nameless they are confined to a particular role because of their color or dress in one situation for example a white youngster wearing glasses tells his friend a negro boy here comes a couple of kids ill demonstrate my theory as they approach he slaps a chinese boy in the face a girl standing nearby socks the bespeckled boy in the face in the last panel we see him lying on the ground gamely declaring see its like i told you    hate breeds hate the words hate and racism are used cleverly by morrie without bitterness but certainly with a touch of sadness in situations that have heavy moral overtones at  morrie turner and his wee pals which he originally wanted to call dinky fellas are fighting their way to the top for a cartoonistany cartoonist success comes hard in the face of stiff competition from those who have made it and those who are flooding the market with an overabundance of new ideas the son of a pullman porter morrie was raised in oakland the neighboring metropolitan city to berkeley where he lives with his wife letha and young son morrie jr  in a comfortable home as a young boy drawing came naturally to morrie in grammar school one of his doodles of a football game with all  players was framed by the principal and proudly displayed on his office wall because it had so much action in it morrie has been drawing ever since even during world war ii while morrie was serving with the armyair forces th bomber group his cartoons were providing laughter for the soldiers married shortly after the war morrie made a living for awhile as a freelance artist and then went to work as a police clerk in  to support his family by  he decided it was time to find his own soapbox since leaving the police department he has spent fulltime creating negro humor during these  years however morrie has produced more than  cartoons for  different magazines ranging from true to better homes and gardens the development of wee pals was influenced by comedian dick gregory and charlie schulz whom morrie idolizes as one of the cartoon greats his original allnegro cast was flatly rejected by several major syndicates including united features which handles peanuts whose executives told morrie wee pals would not be a profitable venture nevertheless morrie did not give up his big break finally came a little more than a year ago while the strip was running in a hometown negro newspaper the berkeley post it immediately caught the eye of lew little head of a san francisco syndicate who convinced morrie to integrate the strip in the first week little sold it to the oakland tribune which bills morrie as one of its former carrier boys and other major dailies quickly followed suit including the richmond citizen in tennessee in just the short time that wee pals has been before the public it has found a welcome reception the womens antidefamation league of philadelphia recently honored morrie with its  humanitarian award the tribune and the los angeles times which also publishes wee pals have nominated him for the national conference of jews and christians brotherhood award morrie is now producing another integrated army situation strip for the chicago defender called dogbert it carries biting humor and gives morrie a chance to let off steam says morrie candidly where do i go from here 
problems facing negro actors
by woodie king jr
he problems of the negro actor are not so much the negro actors problem as they are the white ameriwhen an american negro actor is faced with playing a character he must also confront a trio of problems first should the character be american in its truest sense when american life is most american it is apt to be most theatrical says ralph ellison second should he be negro as negroes really are or negro as we have led whites to believe we are in order to endure and third should the character be american negro the peculiar sensation doubleconsciousnessan american a negro w e b dubois these problems are not easily solved since white america has already told us what the answers are going to be if we intend to act on its stage an old negro actor told me he hated leroi jones two plays the slave and the toilet because they were too filled with protest his student a young beginner agreed with him even to the point of accusing the plays of being vulgar the strange thing was that the beginner had no idea of the kind of plays or the problems the old actor faced during the thirties and forties no idea of the vast history of his craft i will get back to this a little later it was a strange conversation the old actor putting down jones for protest writing and at the same time telling me acting in the thirties had life vitality    federal theatre    negro macbeth    roll sweet chariot   run little children and the actors leigh whipper edna thomas  son you ought a been there   beginners interested beginners view bad road companies inexperienced stock companies and cute community food digesters these prospective actors watch plays and actors that say absolutely nothing the parts the actors play are not worth the time and efforts put into them beginners watch plays that do not attempt to recreate our experiences they watch cute white plays because that is all white america wants a negro actor can sometimes be found in these cute little comedies anniversary waltz come blow your horn enter laughing kiss and tell or something similar his first lines set the negro beginners teeth on edge the embarrassed prospective actor glances about the white theater all the white faces are laughing at the excessive and ridiculous mannerisms the white director has given the negro actor if he makes it the beginner is thinking this must not happen to him he must do exactly as the white actors else the audience will laugh at him simply for being a negro on the stage too but the beginner doesnt know that white people in general dont know enough about negro life to know which details to look for how to absorb the interpretation the negro actor wants to present after reading more plays and how to act books he assumes that he is ready to be henry fonda marlon brando sidney poitier cary grant sir laurence olivier etc he scouts until he finds a white theatre group needing a flat painter carpenter coffee boy etc however before he can get this job he must be able to intellectually discuss sartre albee pinter ionesco beckett brecht and stanislavski he can name a hundred white actors but he cant name five negro actors this is a sad fact recently i talked to a young actress who is paying a great deal of money for acting and singing lessons she had never heard of w c handy or charlie parker and knew absolutely nothing about the history of the negro theatre yet the beginner can tell one everythingafter two months with the white group about the white theatre he will argue about staging a play about what a writer means about the way he would tackle a role if he ever played one finally the little social group will do a little comedy and the negro beginner will be given a cute little buddy part and the white audiences will laugh at him exactly as they had done at the plays he had watched that featured professional negro actors the beginner will eventually learn the truth about all the little social groups he will begin to doubt when white beginners continue to get leading roles no matter how bad they are while he paints sets and occasionally is rewarded with a walkon or a buddy part or perhaps it will be while reading j marriots massive book on the theatre in which the author warns beginners whites against getting with those little groups and working like a nigger forever he learns after about two years of hard labor that sartre and beckett are only talk with these little groups and that they had no intention of using him except as comic relief university theatre the negro actor enrolls believing he will appear in the plays because he will be a student paying tuition to learn all phases of the theatre however he will not be taught all phases of theatre at a university least of all acting again he is left out because the selections are mostly classics or some other form of archaic theatre that was written when the black man did not figure into the scheme of white america and we know that the professors who select the plays are white therefore personal idiosyncrasies enter into the problem and they keep the negro actor from the stage the basic motive is simply resentment towards miscegenation on the american stage in general and the university stage in particular america doesnt want the negro actor to be a man on its stage and since the basic themes of american plays revolve around sex the negro actors situation is tragic the student obtains nothing at all how can he when the actedout play on stage before an audience is the basic dynamics of such a study the true understanding of acting comes when the student is involved in acting and producing before a live audience and the professors destroy this by selecting classics which the negro actor finds difficulty in acting not to mention the difficulty of casting i cant use you in this one mr  its a swedish or russian norwegian french etc play the majority of negro actors who seek training in university theatre have traces of the southern dialect if they have not assimilated and the way american education is today one cannot have any traces of the south in speech it is an awful but true fact what then if the student actor is cast because of necessity in three sisters enemy of the people antigone st joan major barbara     can he be convincing in such a dated repertory that was written when he did not figure into the scheme of things a drama department must seek truths in theatrical works many professors keep these truths in mind when casting and very often avoid the negro actor the negro actor cannot bring truth as whites see it to the classics however a university willif the national association for the advancement of colored people complainspresent emperor jones or othello and maybe the merchant of venice after consulting  the local synagogue but a negro actor cannot look forward to playing a lead character in a university theatre production after graduating he knows nothing about acting before an audience item i compared the average ratio of plays a negro actor appeared in per season to the average number a white actor appeared in per season at wayne state university in detroit  also compared the total number of plays of negro graduates against white graduates the ratio was  to  drama school the only place to obtain acting experience is the drama school the negro actor either goes to a theatre magazine or obtains information from a friend in the theatre both stressing how great the instructor is at teaching mr stanislavskis method the actor finds his past acting experience brushed aside by the teacher he is immediately tossed into a beginners class if he is above average better than every white actor in the class he will work with some name professionals if not he will work with a teacher who has no knowledge at all about the negro and very little about acting the teachers know that established names are impressive to the new actor he will occasionally mention the times he worked with jesse bonstelle petier garrick fiske modjeska brando or beaumont and fletcher not necessarily in this order yet the drama schools with all their faults are the only places where a negro actor can sharpen his craft this of course is because he actually works on a stage with others before a live audience now after a long and arduous journey the young negro aspirant becomes a professional actor some use the achievements of the past to guide their future i said earlier i would get back to this now it is alright to be of the present no one would knock this but when a performer knows absolutely nothing of the history of his profession how can he possibly understand the present the most proficient actors in the businessjames earl jones robert hooks a freeman jr diana sands cliff frazier brock peters ivan dixon abby lincoln gloria foster clarence williams iii roscoe lee browne know the past present and have ideas of some of the future problems they will encounter the photos by carl van vechten and vandamm of the late charles gilpin rose mcclendon canada lee frank wilson jack carter edna thomas abbie mitchell and freda washington are the perfect examples of the glory of the past they were the actors who brought forth to america the famous allnegro productions of macbeth porgy haiti and other exciting plays via the federal theater project it grew out of harlem and it remains to this day an important contribution to the american stage i think it is because those actors had a purpose so many of todays actors lack purpose and direction how can one grasp for something when there is nothing to grasp shout in rage if not really angry and too one cannot communicate and assimilate at the same time item in the midst of the present racial struggle in this country our stage ignores it it treats it as if it doesnt exist negro playwright the negro actors situation can be bettered by  joining with negro writers and  building an audience within the negro community i think this has been done with great results in detroit at the concepteast theater and in harlem with leroi jones black arts theater both actor and playwright must be willing to experiment with new forms within their respective crafts if this is done the small churches and corner storefronts will be filled with willing ears and it can be done since there is no one to answer to but each other it worked in harlem with the american negro theater they produced phillip yordans anna lucasta with great results it produced worthy plays by negro writers abram hills on strivers row and early plays by young ossie davis and  years later mr davis hit broadway with his romping comedy purlie victorious now ossie davis is an experienced writer not one of the typical library writers clifford odets but one who has the background in acting and directing within a negro community and if we do not know yet that a play about negroes must appeal to negroes we should leave the theatre i do not mean they must love or hate it but they must identify with it the playwright must seize new ideas and techniques if the negro actor is to again be of any importance he must disregard the argument he received in collegean argument for a standardization which is paradoxically strangling the actors contribution item the plays of the early abby theatre in dublin were not considered excellent unless they caused a riot the theatre as it is today without controversy and excitement save leroi jones is dead theatre it is a place to go and digest dinner the negro playwright should write about what he understands all around him he can see what happens when white writers pen negro struggle situations they all fail due to a lack of understanding the subject as a negro playwright tells it explaining to james baldwin how ketti fring came to adapt richard wrights long dream she was sitting by this swimming pool dig and reading this book and she thought this would make a perfectly darling play so she wrote the first few scenes and called out her butler chauffeur and maid and read the first few scenes to them and asked now isnt this the  way you poor downtrodden colored people feel about things  why yes miss fring they answered after considering which is better keeping miss fring happy or disliking the play italics mine and i thought so says the playwright and on we go and on and on all the critics felt approximately the same about it after it opened on broadway here in part is one example from john chapman  i did depart after the first act of this one and reported to my newspaper that this act of the long dream was shoddy and lasciviousa degradation of my seat companion and of several admirable negro actors    it seemed impossible that this play could have been adapted by the lady who did such a beautiful job of adapting thomas wolfes look homeward angel of course the better things about the play were omitted by mr chapman the brilliant direction by lloyd richards and the two excellent performances by a freeman and lawrence winters the same thing happened when baldwin wrote blues for mr charlie all his white characters were badly drawn and many thought this would have been impossible for baldwin to do since it is he who stresses always that negroes know more about whites than whites know of themselves negroes have been taking care of their children and kitchens for over  years i also think that more negro novelists should write for the theatre if the long dream the cool world mandingo etc then it should be john o killens ronald fair william melvin kelley chester himes or some negro writer doing the adapting and even though baldwin failed with his white characters his negro characters were so real and vivid that one is held spellbound by them let me say this in conclusion if the negro actor can impose his own values upon the american stage namely his past present and possible future he can join with white america in controlling it 
theatre of reality 
by ed bullins 
the contemporary american theater  many times the black  playwright finds himself in opposition to the black actor principally when the actor manifests attitudes and behavior that the writer is engaged in altering there are considerations that a novelist does not concern himself with but that a playwright is compelled to if the playwright is realistic and sincere about having his work produced the essential and most arbitrary element is humans the producer the director the actors the hypothetical audience and sadly the critic a generality that can be made is that the producer of stageplays is concerned with making money in america there are the becks of the living theater in new york which the police shut down they are currently touring in europe because america resisted their dedication to pure and noncommercial theater the becks believe that producing plays which advance or keep vital dramatic art is a duty they are so antitraditional as to have staged ezra pounds adaptation of classic japanese noh theatre and in contemporary spirit presenting kenneth browns the brig a dramatic experience which resists labeling not being quite a play nor an antiplay the becks present production frankenstein which opened in europe is experimental which stretches understatement to its limits but it may be the boldest attempt at staging antonin artauds ideas for a theater of cruelty to date the becks living theater is as diverse as art and there are too few young dynamic people today like peter rachtman of the west coast rachtman is one of the group that brought leroi jones powerful dutchman and the toilet to los angeles and san francisco and though profitoriented rachtman is not discouraged from staging productions of quality though they be against the status quo and not meek and quite white american if they are good box office this is only to say that quality sells as does trash ideally lowkeyed quality plays can be produced successfully as can more sensational ones in good or poor taste and this also implies that plays by or about negroes have to be neither sensational controversial nor banal cinema has broken this ground with films such as lilies of the field and nothing but a man but whatever the play it should be honest if honesty is controversial then that is the truth of drama so it is for the black playwright to do the best he can at his job of writing and presenting his vision and not become prematurely emasculated by the prospect of not being produced only because of his race and the themes which come naturally from his cultural experience a black playwright must find his producer as one of any color must and as the black novelist has to seek out a publisher though the playwright may discover he has special handicaps in getting produced for one unlike the widening shelves of negro novels there have been only a small number of successfully produced negro plays that is plays by negroes concerning negro characterization and created for the general audience not that special almost exclusively white audience which patronizes negro drama for obscure exotic reasons there is hardly any precedent of success by which the negro playwright can win his producer and the producer being commonly white has the colorbarrier as an intensifier of his suspicions that he is gambling on something into which he has minute insight he worries that he can sell black novelty and innovation to a newly created audience if there were any major black producers this factor might be reduced but the situation appears to remain as it has been the most relevant item in the playwrightproducer relationship is cost it may cost a producer  times more than a publisher to back black talent and businessmens ledgers are especially sensitive to two stains red and black ink if there is a common prayer universally murmured by playwrights one of its petitions is that their work get adequate direction adequate direction is usually more than the compulsiondriven play wright believes probable and he feels inspired direction is entirely within the dimensions of miracle when the playwright laments his past productions the director is likely to be given a large share of the abuse and the remainder goes to the aggregate components of the disaster of course some playwrights can capably direct their own works but this is rare different aesthetic physics are at work in writing a play and manipulating the many elements that go into a staged play and the writer is ordinarily too close to his baby to have the scope and objectivity needed to raise the work from the page and from within his imagination so that it may be communicated completely to the audience happily for the novelist he is the lord of the small universe he creates and his fictional souls shuffle along in time to his whims and no others the negro playwright has a special problem in finding better than average direction outside of the new york theater area there is an absence of capable black directors and within new york the same statement possibly holds true why would a negro playwright prefer a negro director it could be assumed by the writer that a director with like cultural experiences could better interpret the nuances and shading of meanings in the work identifying somewhat with the characters situations and with the theme if the reverse is true if  the playwright prefers any excellent direction to that of the average then it is a problem that belongs to every playwright to have his work interpreted skillfully and when the playwright understands that the best direction is beyond the simple limits of interpretation then the directors art and understanding of theater techniques can begin working much to the benefit of the total production the total production stands very nearly upon the performances of the actors even shakespeare has taken many a pratfall behind the ineptness of actors for the playwright of color finding qualified negro actors for his cast is difficult though there are numerous available bodies ready to stand before the lights and expose their teeth and overblown egos of all his problems the negro playwrights greatest is the young trained actor and actress of his same race not the lack of trained people this training does not necessarily qualify these actors for many roles the black playwright has in mind if a negro playwright is to write effectively and honestly he must draw upon his experience all negroes do not come from the ghetto naturally but if the situations the playwright creates upon stage have characters he knows to have basis in truth ordinarily these are black characters it is very difficult for many negro actors and actresses to identify with negro characters from the masses though they do well representing extremely middle class negroes the same may hold true for young white actors at auditions the black playwright might observe a black actress mouthing her lines like a white telephone operator or bouncing through a scene set in the black ghetto of south philadelphia as if she were doris day aping the american version of the blueeyed girl next door some male negro actors appear horrified when asked to speak like sonny liston and seem offended and say that they can not talk that way and will not even say those words they mince out the exits leaving behind remarks like i thought an actor was needed sadly the black playwright did not have it in him that day to create the modern american othello or cleopatra he merely wrote from what he knew so his contemporary play was left in need of just black actors ones who were not afraid to act as black human beings a playwrights major problem as opposed to a novelists is that each of his characters must be what he is they all must stand tall this must be brought out by the convincing performances of the actors to be what the character is then the actor must portray the character in an honest and natural manner but today it would not seem unlikely that a director would come before a negro actor newly graduated from an american school of acting and spend hours with him saying now remember in this part you are a negro you are black and the pity is that the actor would really have to sweat to get into his role he would have to work diligently convincing himself that he was indeed negro often a characterization falls the actor the director or the playwright fails collapsing the structure of the plays reality about their ears a novelist has more range to ramble in than his characters believability or their situations he can even chat philosophize and wisecrack with his readers characters in drama are resented by the audience for their not sticking to the point maintaining the honesty of their motivations with the negro playwright it is the negro actor who dramatizes the vital characters and the actor must breath the truth of his own conviction in that character for his portrayal to be perfect but not all the blame rests with the black actor or his schooling there are interracial and a few entirely negro theater groups training black actors to do little other than the greek classics shakespeare chekhov and shaw casting negroes indiscriminately in every conceivable role a sort of white characterization done in authentic black face true the experience for the actor is invaluable and should be a part of his training but a hidden evil exists in the continuation or the strict adherence to this brand of liberality it is a selfdefeating device for the actor the black actor is unintentionally made to say in essence that he can act too he a black man can do the classic repertoire of the continent as can a white actor that he can act and not only be stereotyped in butler roles set in the ante bellum south well it should be known that he can act especially by the actor one of his number has won an oscar and others appear on nationwide tv though it is questionable whether these are any criteria of adequate professional standards incidentally these black actors play negroes not creon following the above type of reasoning is tantamount to the black authors wasting years telling his waiting readers that he can write that he is concerned with the art of writing and nothing else but getting almost no writing completed and in print aside from his infrequent artistic manifestos sent out to indicate that he is still breathing the fight by the black actor to prove that he can act is as much over as the black writers fight to prove that he can write and both should get to work at their crafts and be aware that aristotle and his aesthetic dogmas are not of this time and never had been meant for the black artist anyway there are new roles new themes and new definitions being created and explored now and the black actor and writer should become aware  in approaching one of the artistic black theater groups the negro playwrights scripts may be taken and returned shortly and the playwright told that his work is too experimental or obscene if it uses too much of the negro idiom of the ghetto the groups premise might be that when negroes of flesh and blood are depicted on the stage that this is verging upon revolution and is too drastic it is far beyond the groups range of belief and comprehension they can not become familiar with a real negro on the stage or the playwright may be told that they do not bother with original scripts that they do the classics or the work of proven negro writers like langston hughes that is the negro writers who have made it somewhat with the white press and then are considered minor celebrities by the black bourgeoisie then the artsy craftsy colored folk accept them as their own when asked why they do not produce young black playwrights the answer almost invariably is there are none are there of course there are none to their knowledge because of their refusal to look for or acknowledge any until the white critics deem it correct for them to with this situation existing entering little theater for the black playwright is more than likely not an asset to his career but a handicap for he will seldom find other than the conventional timid and intellectually lazy and backward bourgeois black masquerading as an artist the theater of reality should be mentioned now when speaking of the audience and the critic the revolutionary nature of this theater is not of style and technique but of theme and character any theatrical style or method can be used separately or in combinations to reach the truth of the play in this manner the play could begin naturalistically with a character in a realistic setting and progress through expressionism surrealism absurdity and back to realism dramatizing the journey of the character through his own pysche to reach his loss of innocence selfawareness or illumination to reach what individually is called reality the method is not the goal in this theater the result must elicit the single response of yes so it is not a call for a return to realism or naturalism that this theater calls for it is the exposure of illusion through exploding myths and lies that are disguised as reality and truths these myths and especially those concerning the black man clutter the heart of his existence his humanity nor is this theater a plea for his humanity time will not be wasted in silly issues this theater is not exclusively about negroes nor for negroes its trend should only go counter to that force in western society which dehumanizes enslaves and defeats man at his best whether this force originates in mans institutions or his bewildered psyche that has built a defense and powerstructure that can not be much longer contained this theater in this century may be viewed as against society the american society in particular by white critics it will undoubtedly be misnomered protest literature and yes it will certainly expose some of the wrongs of the society for this theater is against the hypocritical cant and morality of this sick society and demonstrates how sick the society is by exposing her sores her warped humans if this is social realism or protest then let it speak reality for all people not only a temporarily deprived selfish middleclass today the bulk of the theater going audience is white one problem for the negro playwright is that part of the audience will resist the reality of his characters they will refuse to identify with black characters in any way even the middleclass negro members of the audience will fight the characters if they come from the submerged elements of the culture the characters of the new reality will be fought whether they are upon a stage or found in a book and most of the inaccurate criticism of negro works have had this kind of bias at its roots the white critic is deceived by himself and his colleagues and the university departments of literature always  years behind perpetuate and sustain these myths one great boring myth is that black writers are collectively engaged in writing protest literature and can or will do little else these same people should get hip to chester himes a talent of major proportions who has been around before a lot of them this lie of protest has circulated so widely and convincingly that it has damaged most contemporary negro writers as passed over earlier it may have destroyed the most talented black writer of today but perhaps the times will rescue him for his art and it is hokum lately two of the most authentic works of black protest literature have been the book black like me and the documentary play in white america  and both have been authored by white men but small knowledged english professors across the country if they mention it at all without having seen the production or having read the script are branding leroi jones play the toilet a protest play when it is simply a love story done in a melodramatic naturalistic vein the writer can not worry about the audience he knows there is a small hardcore audience for him and they will discover one another and luckily the audience will grow to universal proportions and the writer knows that there is only one critic himself all that a reviewer or a critic can do positively for a writer is to get him more audience appeal or get him more readers if the critic fails to achieve this then the writer should dismiss him the black writer knows that the critics are white and they are most certain not to understand his work or get its finer points especially when the writer is not slanting his work to a middleclass white audience and he is setting his own limitations and not relying upon the critics judgments honesty is what the writer should be after the theater of reality is an attempt to return to mans honesty to himself to his fellows and in his vision it is indeed a theater of metaphysical yearnings the playwright does this job by uncovering the reality of his art his humanity his existence as an intelligent and moral entity in the universe and makes the entire universe an audience of this transformation of the psyche and spirit this new revolution is of the mind and spirit and the revolution seems to have begun and if it has there are many facets to it there are the doers there are the theorists and there are the chroniclers and story tellers each is working from within a framework of reality which can always be expanded illuminated and hopefully passed on 
festival time in iluhur
the festival t is a grandiose idea andas such ideas are likely to be  characterized by a certain dreaminess but that is not necessarily a fault without great dreams many little miracles would not be possible the chief dreamer is leopold sedar senghor the poetpresident of senegal like most serious african leaders president senghor is concerned with africas achievement of genuine power and consequence in the world and he feels that the edifice of african power and consequence must be built on a base of cultural security the historical significance of the first world festival of negro arts flows from two facts president senghor told the senegalese people the first is that the festival will be held in dakar in senegal in other words in africa the birthplace of the negro peopleof homo sapiens himself even  where it will mean something more than a return to original sources it will be a case of man sinking his roots into mother earth the second fact is that the stage of defending negritude has passed and that the festival will serve rather to illustrate it and as an illustration and no longer a theoretical exposition it will constitute a definite action a positive contribution to the construction of a civilization based on universal values in a word we will have ceased once and for all to be cultural consumers and will at long last ourselves become cultural producers such then is the significance of this event which will mark the advent of a new era for us the era of cultural independence i say independence and not autarchyfar from it because the works to be assembled and displayed here will almost invariably have been enriched by foreign contributions and it is well that this should be so since the problem for negritude in this twentieth century of ours is to participate in the convergence of all mankindnot exactly in this atomic century by contributing new techniques but by contributing a new style a soul the same which quickened the pulse of homo sapiens when the sun of reason rose above the horizon   it is the language of poetry the actual planning of the first world festival of negro arts was entrusted to a local committee at dakar and to the governments of the dozens of countries in africa and the americas which indicated interest in participating in the festival the festivals aims were generally outlined as follows to permit negro artists throughout the world to return periodically to the sources of their art to make known the contributions of negritude a negros pride in his race and a recognition of the innessbrown of new york city john a davis president of the american society of african culture is the committees vice president marian anderson is vicechairman of the committees board of directors and mrs lyndon b johnson wife of the president of the united states is honorary  negros unique creative ability based on his african heritage to make it possible for negro artists to meet and demonstrate their talents to members of the international art world to advance international and interracial understanding the american committee for the festival is headed by mrs virginia chairman of the committee in many ways the american participants in the festival will strikingly illustrate the concept of negritude  the african origin the pride of race and the amalgamation of cultures prominent among these participants will be miss anderson duke ellington and his orchestra baritone william warfield soprano martina arroyo dancer arthur mitchell and gospel singer marion williams all the lively and plastic arts will be exhibited during the  days of the festivalfrom april  there will be exhibitions of contemporary paintings as well as of traditional african sculpture several african countries will present their national dance and theatre troupes choral groups will appear from the united states the depaur chorus as well as from the congo leopoldville and other countries and a nightly pageant under the stars will blend african folk music negro spirituals and th century european compositions grand prizes will be presented in the areas of literature filmmaking and performing music composition and popular entertainment and a special colloquium on negro art in the life of the people will draw authorities on negro life and art from all over the world to dakar exhibitions and prizes  nigeria is the star nation for the first world festival of negro arts and as such has the right to the only exhibition dedicated to one particular country the dakar town hall has been chosen as the exhibition hall for the special nigerian presentation  there will be some  specimens on view in the new museum carefully selected to reflect aspects of economic technical social religious or cultural life the exhibition will be taken to paris following the festival  the great hall of the palace of justice will house the exhibition of modern and contemporary art sent to dakar by the plus countries participating in the

for flights between europe and south america it is an old colonial center but it is a very new cityit is in fact two cities the principal city is a glittering aggregation of modern government buildings apartments and villas with broad boulevards and cozy parks the other city is a conglomeration of shackssome of them all but incredible  and pungent market places and medinas straight out of the ancient past the main city is frenchflavored and mostly frenchoccupied there are some  europeans in dakaror there were that many until the recent decision from paris cutting back on military outposts in senegal and other african countries closely associated with the french government the europeans reside in most of the beautiful villas and plush apartment buildings on the plateau the cosmopolitan heart of the city but not because there is racial segregation there emphatically is not only a  few africans can afford to live in such luxury also the better shops along the avenues william ponty and maginot and bordering independence square are owned by the french and those not owned by the french are in the hands of lebanese and greek traders the other city is predominantly african its borders are not geographical for africans live throughout the city even on the plateau the french colonialists being less racist than the british did not disdain the africans in whose midst they found themselves and so they built their villas next door to the african huts the african city is principally distinguished by the style and quality of its housing the better of these old residences are low rambling structures walledin from the street and set around a courtyard the worst of them are wood and cardboard leantos but there are the medinas the native quarters which stretch for miles depressingly toward the developing suburbs but all in the african city is not depressingfar from it some of the new housing developments beyond the medinas are handsomer than any similar residences negroes occupy in america they were designed for middleincome people and there are individual villas replete with gardens and garages as well as blocks of apartments there also are shopping centers usually with new movie theatres with one key exceptionthe  ministry of financethe government of senegal is in the hands of africans and it is africans one sees relaxing against the burgundy upholstery of the huge citroen limousines the cadillacs of france gliding through the streets but africans are all but absent in significant industry and business in the sprawling markets the african stalls are the poorest and least attractive and africans are present in the offices of the utilities and the professional services primarily as clerks there are more than  hotels in dakar a few of them ngor croix du sud very good a few of them fair vichy hotel de la paix atlantic plateau but most of them quite small and ordinary there are many restaurants some of them excellent and nearly all of them french the exceptions are the vietnamese and lebanese restaurants there are no africanowned restaurants in dakar that americans would want to patronize one of the liveliest nightclubs is africanownedthe nianey it is located on la corniche the seaside drive and it is as wellappointed as any of the others discotheques are popular and there are several to choose from the music is as familiar in dakar as it is in atlanta and the dancing is not very different there are several sidewalk cafes a large number of movie theatres super markets and shops selling everything from mink coats to razor blades some of the most interesting shops for being exotic are owned by the lebanese and greeks and they feature items of clothing and utility which appeal to the religious faith of the african populace that faith is islamic an estimated  per cent of the senegalese are moslems the great mosque is a structure of imposing stature and considerable beauty there are several dozen lesser mosques scattered throughout the city and an astonishingly elegant mosque at touba some  kilometers from dakar the people the dominant raceor tribe in dakar as in all senegal is wolof other races are peul serere tukulor diola and malinke the wolofs are prominent in government education and in the arts the senegalese have been in the vanguard for generations for they were favored by the french administrators during colonialism as teachers and subofficials throughout the vast french west african empire the large number of french people in dakar is a consequence of the citys choice as governmental industrial and educational center during colonialism thousands of frenchmen pulled up roots in france and settled in dakar and many of those still living there were born there they no longer control the actual machinery of government but the industry remains solidly in their hands and while an increasing number of africans are assuming key jobs in education top posts in the university and the secondary schools are held by frenchmen and other europeans the president of the rapidly growing university of dakar is french for example next to the french the major merchants in dakar are the lebanese and greeks they are traders by tradition and whole blocks in the center of the city are lined with their shops one little different from the other all selling the brilliant cloth and arab robes so popular with the africans the near easterners like the french have little to do with the actual business of running the government a colorful minority in dakar are the moors the angular handsome nomads from mauritania who reap considerable wealth through the establishment of small stores in the african areas there are few moorish women among them apparently the moors come down on foot from mauritania in teams of three or four spend a period of three or four months minding the stores which remain open virtually around the clock then return to their families while others take over the commercial chores they live very simply spending money only on food their simple blueandwhite or blackandwhite robes and on sandals they socialize with none of the other groups another minority in dakar are the portuguese an artificial race of portuguese and african ancestry they hold themselves somewhat aloof from the ordinary africans and yet they lack the status of the educated africans they are clerks barbers and minor functionaries festival facilities  at the cost of some  the government renovated and enlarged yoff airport perhaps the busiest air terminal south of the sahara  a new classiclined museum was especially built to house the countrys impressive collection of african art and artifacts the collection of art and sculpture which has been assembled from all over the world for the festival also will be exhibited there  the daniel sorano theatre one of the most modern and most comfortable theatres in the world was built for the festival most of the performances will be presented there before a select audience the theatre seats only   amity stadium which will accommodate some  persons also was built for the festival all performances held at the daniel sorano theatre also will be held in the stadium so that the general public can attend  another minority in dakar are the portuguese an artificial race of portuguese and african ancestry they hold themselves somewhat aloof from the ordinary africans and yet they lack the status of the educated africans they are clerks barbers and minor functionaries  goree island one of the historic sites of africa will be the scene of a nightly sound and light spectacle during the festival the island served as a staging area for many of the hundreds of thousands of africans who were sent into bondage during slavery it also was inhabited by the dutch english and french during different eras and served as a fort for france during the two world wars on one end of the island the elaborate underground tunnels and fortifications reminiscent of the maginot line remain pretty much as they were originally the united states gift to the senegalese government for the festival is a handsome motor launch which will transport visitors from the dakar docks out to goree island the trip takes about  minutes festival footnotes  while christians represent only about six per cent of the dakarois population there are several remarkably handsome catholic churches in the citv and the cathedral of dakar which occupies a site at the very center of the plateau section is an impressive edifice some of the choral music performances will be presented at the cathedral  the brilliant costumes of the african womenlavenders and crimsons and chartreuses are favoriteswill startle many american negroes but the sight should prove once and for always that bright colors definitely do compliment dark skins black american women traditionally have shied away from brilliant colors for much the same reason that many negroes refuse to eat watermelon but the sarilike costumes in senegal might begin to change all that  the artisan village a little compound where ceramists goldsmiths and silversmiths weavers and sculptors work display and sell their products has been upgraded and modernized for the festival  visitors will find unfortunately that prices also have been upgraded and modernized the best buys here probably will be gold and silver jewelry as other items may be bought more reasonably by haggling with peddlers along avenue william ponty or on the streets of the city  haggling over price incidentally is a tradition in africa the buyer who pays the first price asked by the seller will be taken africans expect to argue and bargain and they are skillful at it however for the american unaccustomed to such practices the danger is that inflated prices will be paid for items  the sight of men walking along the streets holding hands might startle some americans but it shouldnt it means only that they are moslems and friends and not as the late richard wright naively assumedthat they are sexual or homosexual partners  there are some  lepers in senegal and some of them will appear as beggars on the streets of dakar  visitors to the festival must expect to be regularly accosted by beggars as well as by platoons of peddlers many handicapped africans are trained to beg for a living and the practice is encouraged by the concept of charity in the islamic faith  only those with very strong stomachs and insatiable curiosity are advised to brave the bowels of the great central market but for those the experience will be worth it it is fascinating for example to watch the women hack and approtion the huge fish sold in the markets lower depths  the french in dakar will be hostile at worst and will feign monumental indifference at best they should be ignored however festival visitors should insist on courtesy and service as they certainly will be paying for it  a dollar is worth  francs frenchafrican community francs not the kind from france on the books but the local bank exchange is about  francs for a dollar travelers check and  for a dollar bill that does not include the one per cent charge for making the exchange  all visitors to the festival should have visas preferably obtained before entering the country however president senghor has given assurances that visas will be available at the dakar airport for those arriving without them there is a charge visitors also should have roundtrip or intransit tickets indicating that they will travel on from senegal after the festival  apart from taking the usual smallpox and yellow fever and cholera and typhus shots visitors to senegal should take along dependable antimalaria pills  taxis are plentiful in dakar and they have meters visitors should not pay more than is indicated on the meterexcept late at night when the meter tab is doubled as a sort of service tax  tipping in senegal is not done according to americanor even europeancustom a five per cent tip is considered adequate  there are several excellent beaches at dakarat the hotel ngor below the coastal drive near the residence of the american ambassador mercer cook sr and below the park along boulevard roosevelt there also is an excellent beach at goree island restaurants are located nearby 
and save a round for jamie brown 
by anita r cornwell
e stood in front of the bara tall thin forlorn figure in soiled khakisfingering the c hange jn his pockets he was new in town having just hopped off an interstate tractor trailer some thirty minutes ago and he knew he should be looking for some place to sleep but the one dollar and fortyseven cents clutched in his bony hand did not provide the needed encouragement a brisk september breeze swept down the avenue banging against his hunched shoulders and he looked around wondering if hed ever see a friendly face again then from inside the bar he heard the jukebox hammering out a down home blues which set the wheels of memory spinning in his aching head he jerked his hands from his pockets and slowly pushed through the battered door the music was still loud and going good as he slid onto a corner stool and plunked his quarter down so thered be no question concerning his ability to pay he ordered a glass of beer then pulled out a crumpled pack of stale cigarettes the record ended and soon he was aware of one man pulling away from the small group at the other end of the bar and apparently headed in his direction the stranger gingerly holding a bottle of beer in one hand and a long thin cigar in the other wore a wide brim beige felt hat which set firmly on his head as though welded there and a yellow silk tee shirt which stretched endlessly across his bulky chest and disappeared down into black gabardine slacks tightly gathered at waist and ankles his tan narrowtoed shoes made quick tapping sounds on the hard barroom floor and any moment jamie fully expected the fellow to stick the cigar between his teeth yank the hat from his head and break into the old soft shoe routine as he neared jamies stool his leathery face broke in a gaptoothed grin and jamie not quite knowing what else to do lifted his glass and drained it surprisingly enough jamie brown jr the perennial country boy and harry lem yonkers onetime country boy now turned city slicker hit it off rather well i was born in south carolina lem told jamie after they had moved over to a booth but once i lit outta them woods i never looked back he gave a significant pause then you from down that way too i bet jamie nodded he was born in georgia in the midst of the depression but hed been travelling since he was old enough to hop a moving freight i been in charlotte a while he said carefully lem was silent as he lit a fresh stogie then taking a long pull from his beer he ran one finger across the small neat mustache which hugged his lip like a pencil mark the law after you jamie shook his head woman trouble he said grudgingly then began fishing around for another cigarette lem grinned i guess you busted he said finally jamie nodded his brooding eyes staring at his beer glass he hadnt allowed himself to wonder why lem was being so friendly so if it was a little game in the back room he was after he could move on now however lem only leaned back against the booth his odd catlike eyes examining the ceiling while his mind seemed busy with some far off activity i got a room up on the avenue he began slowly and if you aint quite prepared to put up at the bellevue maybe youd like to try your luck there till you git straightened out jamies stomach muscles tightened if there was one thing he was sick of it was sharing other peoples rooms in charlotte when he wasnt with his girl he had his cousins two small but overactive boys in the bed next to his and back home hed slept on a pallet under the kitchen table even now he could feel that hard floor trembling as an outraged march wind tore at the corners of that crumbling shack he looked over at lem almost ready to refuse the offer but the agile lem jumped ahead of him of course he began amiably if you have other plans now dont let me interfere and jamie of course had no plans there were dreams but nothing that included an immediate roof over his head so finally he accepted lems invitation and decided to worry about motives later lems room up around nd street was fairly comfortable and surprisingly clean the bed looked terribly tempting to jamie who had been sleeping on everything but a bed for the past several weeks lem explained that the landlady took care of everything just leave your clothes in the bathroom he said to the boneweary jamie miss mamiell tend to em late next morning while jamie dressed in his freshly laundered clothing lem slumped down into the lone comfortable chair propped his narrowtoed shoes up on the outdated coffee table and began sounding jamie out whereupon jamie promptly announced his intentions of finding gainful employment lem nearly swallowed his stogie man you crazy or something that eight to five crap is for squares you one of th little people and black to boot you aint ever gonna git nowhere nohow so you may as well live while you standing still in your own little rut turning his back on lem jamie grunted his hands deep in his pockets his eyes raking the avenue his mind a thousand miles away on caro the girl who had twotimed him in charlotte finally he looked back at lem who was still on the same old tune the way i figure it lem was saying rather smugly a mans gotta use his head to git along in this old world now me i can git a little lucky at times so i get picked up now and then so what he demanded waving a languid hand there aint hardly any more bugs in the cooler than here and i dont hafta worry bout the rent or the women hounding my door his eye caught jamies man them broads can be a pain cant they they give you a quarter and think they own you one of them big loud ones got her wine head tore up one night and come barging in here like hurricane hattie and liken to kilt a little chick id just met at the timbers he sighed heavily remembering the atrocious incident and i guess you know what miss mamie said after that no more entertaining in the room meaning no more broads naturally a faint smile crossed jamies lips as he pictured the fat broad giving lems chick hell now he knew why lem didnt mind him staying here but he wanted no part of lems copdodging schemes so early next morning armed with several want ads from the sunday paper which hed found stuffed under the bath tub he made his way downtown and many hours later a rejoicing jamie had a job as an elevator operator he could hardly wait to see lems face when he told him the news man youre kidding lem said quickly and jamie mistaking lems reaction for disbelief  over his great good fortune went on to relate even the minute details which led to his find when jamie finished lem held his head in mock despair and here i spend half the day lining up something good for you he groaned man the setup is waiting an open book you can make more in one day with that territory ikes got for you than youd make in a whole year hiking some elevator up and down jamie clammed up his wounded sheep dogs eyes avoided lem who immediately realized his approach had lacked finesse tell you what he said springing up out of the chair and giving jamie a smile which displayed his gap and most of his gold fillings ill get ike to hold the book whilst you think about it he sighed his eyes rolling up to the ceiling its sure a sweet setup though i would take it myself but them bluecoated bastards are on my tail right now i cant even look crosseyed less they right there smelling around and you cant pay off nobody hardly any more he lamented turning to stare out at his beloved avenue jamie shrugged but did not vocally reject the proposal if lem wanted to believe he was stupid enough to get mixed up with the numbers racket he would go right along letting him think it but he was ready to settle down and he knew if he had a steady job and kept his eyes open sooner or later hed find the right girl to settle down with him and that girl stepped into his elevator one rainy morning in midoctober without even bothering to nod at him he was old on the job now and in his lanky countryboy fashion had even acquired a bit of polish being tall and slender with the flat hips and wide sweeping shoulders of a flashing halfback his uniform hung well on him he got along with the other operators did his job well and banked what little he could after paying the rent and lending lem five here and there his account was slow shaping up but he really didnt mind the money spent on lem for in addition to his generous nature he was well aware that whatever lems motives he had done him a great favor by taking him in when he was down to his last dollar and despite lems constant ribbing jamie was grateful for his companionship for he found the ways of the city baffling indeed though constantly surrounded by people he had never been lonelier in his entire life his coworkers were friendly but they were not his friends and those faceless bodies who poured into his car day after day really didnt know him from a crack in the wall then at five oclock sharp the whole horde fled from the building as if it were enveloped in flames then retha hodges glided into his elevator breaking the shackles from his haunted heart yet already he was her willing slave had she but known it at lunch time he caught sight of her again briefly for she took the late lunch when the crowd reached its peak and was soon swallowed up he glared at the hungry mob surging past him and for one awful moment his vexation was such that he thought of taking the whole load to the basement and leaving them to find their way up the best they could at five oclock he missed her completely and was so shaken that he actually toyed with the idea of asking ben their starter about her but by the time he was free ben had vanished as had practically every other soul in the huge building when he finally pushed through the revolving doors dusk had firmly set in and mumbling to himself he slowly made his way to the corner where he waited for the light to change banging his fists one against the other he stared up at the darkened tower of city hall where a host of unseen starlings chattered madly like women at a bridge party then glared at the long succession of jersey buses inching around the corner spitefully blocking his way unaware that he was not going anywhere anyway as lem was only too willing to point out he was standing still in his own little rut damn lem damn him to hell he muttered startling several pedestrians standing near him then he whirled and blindly walked in the opposite direction si v in no time at all she was smiling at him and he had even managed to learn her name but then he made no further progress whatsoever and daily he grew more desperate he simply had to make her aware of him as a person not as just another operator yet the more he pondered the situation the more insoluble it seemed then against his better judgment he sought advice from lem man youd better let that chick alone said lem standing flatfooted in yellow striped socks and flowered undershorts dont you know them whitecollar broads are the worse skirts under th sun theyre looking for some square wholl set em up in the suburbs like theyre queen of th may he yanked the stogie from his mouth forget that broad man and come on down to th timbers with me where you can get your kicks without paying with your own blood jamie already in bed snorted furiously what make you think you know so damn much you always talking outta both sides of your mouth but you aint got no more than i got lem cackled as he strutted over to the bed man i told you before aint none of us got nothing and we aint ever going to git nothing so why dont you stop whining that broad you lusting after aint thinking bout you her folks done sent her to college and they expects her to marry somebody with more education than she got i bet you anything if she aint already got her eye on some lawyer or some teacher she got some joker stashed away in medical school  man her folks aint gonna have nobody like you messin round anybody like her jamie swung with the pillow then but lem ducked away laughing fiendishly and scooted up the hall to the bathroom the next day was rainy and dreary and jamies spirits were exceedingly low for somehow that morning he had missed seeing retha around ten he took his break and skitted through the damp mist down to the corner cafeteria he had not had breakfast and briefly as he moved through the line he considered buying bacon and eggs but his stomach rebelled so he settled for two cups of coffee then as he sauntered away from the cashier he thought how nice if one of the cups were for retha so vivid then was the image of her in his mind that when he actually saw her sitting alone he thought surely he was still daydreaming then she smiled and motioned for him to sit with her and his heart took wings despite the horrid clammy weather she sparkled like a newly minted coin and he heard lems sarcastic warning ringing in his ears her folks dont want nobody like you messin round anybody like her but he quickly forgot lem in his desperate effort to find something fetching to say to her almost in the next moment it seemed she had to leave he stood also confused and bedazzled on the verge of leaving with her no please stay and finish your  coffee she requested with such delightful charm that he fairly blossomed she laughed then a pure clear sound which fell upon his ears like distant church chimes and then to his utter astonishment he heard her saying that perhaps they would meet again tomorrow at break time jamie left the building the following morning staring down at his feet bleakly wondering if they carried him on still another of his fools errands pushing through the revolving doors he ran down the steps that led into the restaurant he saw her at once sitting at the same table joy transformed his face and for the moment his shyness left him i missed you this morning he said i thought maybe you didnt come in i came early she said the work has piled up tremendously then she nodded toward the counter dont you want coffee today he moved his chair closer his eyes devouring her face naw i dont drink it much he answered not really concentrating on what he was saying i hadnt et breakfast yesterday a faint flush stained her cheeks and instantly he was conscious of his speech people like her didnt use words like et and he didnt usually any more in charlotte before he met caro he had gone to night school for two years but maybe hed better hunt around for something to brush up again he couldnt have his girl blushing at his bad language retha gave him a dazzling smile but his selfdoubts had tied his tongue now then in one of the most exquisite gestures hed ever seen she lifted her hand and touched his own as it quivered near the sugar container i have to leave now jamie were terribly rushed just now but tomorrow perhaps     her dark eyes slipped into his and he felt her hand warm and soft and burning him to his very soul and he was so filled with love for her he could have wept    thereafter morning coffee became a habit with them and soon they were lunching together his shyness with her all but vanished as he gained more knowledge of her life away from the building but in spite of all the moments spent together at break and luncheon after work ended retha hodges was still as lost to him as the moon for a while he convinced himself that this was only a temporary situation and spent his evenings exploring the city sometimes even venturing into one of the movie houses on chestnut street but it was no good in the movies alone when your girl is god only knows where so he decided to spend his free time on another selfimprovement kick wandering into learys one evening he came across a used english textbook but not until he noted the gleam in lems eyes did he realize his error in bringing the book home for up until that very moment he had given lem the impression that the girl on the job no longer interested him lem swooped the book up from its wrappings and waved it high above his head man what you doing with this junk english essentials you gonna ruin your brains if you got any you talk all right almost as good as me then he made as if to throw the book into the waste basket and jamie hopped up with a violent start lem laughed then laid the book on the dresser but jamies nerves remained coiled for he knew lem wasnt through with the matter and he was in the right mood for getting things off his chest too then as he stood ready for battle the solution to the problem of seeing retha after work suddenly came to him he would get a place of his own and the idea such a remote possibility minutes before and now so very real filled him with exultation lem saw the moist brown eyes come to life as the thin angular face glowed from an inner fire and for the first time he realized that jamie might soon move out of his reach so youre still messing round that broad from west philly huh he exclaimed as he flung himself into the chair and ran a finger along the pencilmark mustache man shes gonna cut your guts out and wear em for beads i thought you had some sense  but jamie did not move nor had the slight smile of wonder left his face and lem knew he was on the wrong track he knocked the ashes from his cigar then pointed it at jamie i guess you know the only way you can get to first base with a dame like that is to have folding cabbage and lots of it jamie knew what lem was building up to but in spite of himself he listened indeed hed been thinking along similar lines himself his eyes grew moody his lips took on a pouting look his common sense told him that retha hodges wouldnt touch him with a tenfoot pole if he got mixed up with the numbers but would she ever have to know lem lit a fresh stogie but kept one eye on jamie to know just when to bring on his clincher then finally he stood up tell you what he began suppose we walk down to th timbers later on i hear ike might drop by sometime tonight and you know he cant hold that book open forever hes losing money man that territorys worth  a day if its worth a penny jamies heart thumped like a kettle drum he wished lem would shut up yet desperately he wanted to know how much hed make with such a book the  take home pay he got now hardly took him around the corner then finally the walls and the ceiling closed in on him i think ill take a walk he said grabbing frantically for his jacket ill see you later with his cigar delicately poised like a stunted foil lem came forward at the timbers he asked softly jamie hesitated maybe and he practically ran from the room the mild november night hung heavily on his shoulders as he moved wearily down the avenue toward broad street he had little idea where he was going and couldnt care less if retha hodges were not with him then the need to see and talk with her overwhelmed him he found a phone booth in a crowded cutrate drug store and called her she agreed to meet him at a bar out on girard avenue near th street she was waiting for him and he was so glad to see her his voice left him momentarily its late he said finally i know you ought to be home    she shook her head its not quite eleven i live just around the corner his heart thudded at the mention of how near her home was to him then he asked the question that was burning a hole in his brain if i had a place would you come to see me sometime she regarded him for a long moment and he wasnt sure whether she wanted to laugh or spit in his face then she smiled and told him she would perhaps sometime he tried to grin but didnt quite make it its not good enough he thought despairingly but it was better than an outright no but what he really wanted to know he couldnt ask or rather didnt want to risk having answered but still but still i love you he blurted  out before he was aware the words  had even formed on his tongue i know she said quietly then looked away from him damn he thought frantically damn damn damn wasnt she going to say anything more then she spoke again and brought the roof down on his head jamie im engaged to a fellow in law school hes my brothers room mate at howard howard howard university in washington she told him he finishes in june we plan to marry then oh jamie said and the word took off swirling around the room like a stunned insect oh he finally said again his mind unable to think of any other word his heart a ton of lead threatening to pull him through the floor she touched his hand dont look like that jamie i know i should have told you earlier but i kept putting it off thinking that once you werent soso alone maybe you could better cope with the situation he stood in front of the timbers bar a tall lonely figure fingering the change in his pocket the november air was chilled now cutting through his jacket but he seemed not to notice then lem came out and confronted him i been looking for you man come on in ikes waiting     but jamie merely shook his head his eyes squinting at the dimly outlined lem i just came to let you know im cutting out he said finally then before lem could reply jamie turned and walked on down the avenue his shoulders bent against the night
