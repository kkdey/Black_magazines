and l rights
by donald r hopkins
here are i would say two elements of sadness in the present controversy being waged within the civil_rights movement it is very sad to see the traditional civil_rights movement dying in the inglorious man ner that it is and it is sad to see the new philosophy of the black ghetto being born in the inauspicious manner that it is ideally both events being patently inevitable would have occurred with so little fanfare that this country would have been reaping the ineluctable benefits of the new black selfconsciousness even before it realized that something dramatically new and exciting had been wrought in its midst unfortunately and perhaps to its ultimate damnation such is not the way of race relations in the united states where new myths and old realities lack even the tinny grandeur one finds in its international politics it is possible to look at americas attitude toward say the war in vietnam without feeling quite so nauseated as one feels in searching her attitudes toward black_power or any other philosophical position the black american may assume which is to the slightest degree at variance with the sacred attitudes of the white liberal establishment this is so because the impulse to war the avarice and arrogance of international power politics can be made out to appear more rational mistakes may be made in calculating the will to resist of a given people relationships become artificially structured and the course of human events takes on an internal logical cohesiveness to which the desires of individual  human beings and nations become subordinate if white america has even this  threshold control over its attitudes toward black america it is nowhere apparent one is reminded  of a period a few years back when the popularity of malcolm_x and the publication of c eric lincolns book the black muslims in  america made it appear that the muslims were threatening to set the tone of racial activities in the  northern urban negro communities at this time there went out a great hue and cry from liberal ? whites and from the predictable dependable black bourgeoisie decrying the racism of the muslims praising the moderation of the bourgeoisie and appealing to the  caucasian conscience to come to grips with the urgent problems of the ghetto before the burnbaby burn apocalypse to any rational mind the muslim threat was never potent  even if we disregard the fact that from almost every conceivable perspective the end product of mem bership in the organization was to provide a benefit to the individual and the community the most shallow analysis of the thinking of rankandfile citizens of the black community would have dispelled any fear of an upsurge of militant muslim sympathy the black_power controversy provides the most recent parallel to this uncanny unfathomable paranoia of even the best thinking white americans this would not be so sad were it not for the fact that what the black community in america needs more than money jobs and education is philosophyor to put it better ideology the negro community needs to think collectively in terms that would sharply differentiate its thinking from that of any other racial or national group in this country and such thinking is the sine qua non the absolute condition to the permanent improvement of the status of the negro in america it is my suggestion as it is a basic assumption of black_power advocates that it is possible for a people to literally pull themselves up by their bootstrapsto miraculously stop behaving the way all the mindless dictates of history and sociology would have them behave such a people whose thinking has been changed by the grasping of an ideology which contains certain truths about their historical and social relationships can change the course of human affairs their thoughts by changing their own political and social posture can change the political and social posture of others black_power is a concept which demands that the black american effect such changes in his thinking now or we might say at last i would offer the white american a simple test take any recent picture from a national magazine which shows a poor negro family standing in the squalorous shamble of a living room in a tenement dwelling such pictures are easy to find for they have a great repute and are much in demand then ask yourself which philosophy the civil_rights philosophy or the black_power philosophy is more likely to get the floor swept first i submit that the clear answer is the black_power philosophy should for any reason whatsoever due to pride anger love whatever  per cent of the black slum dwellers decide to sweep their own floors and patch their own walls a social revolution would be heralded that would resound around the world perhaps americas fear of black_power is a fear of this revolution which would so drastically alter the relations between the races in this country the negro as a social construct is not only durable he is useful it permits the white american to deal with the foreign element in its midst without taking it seriously as a human quantity the basic idea behind the civil_rights movement has been that if the negro is sufficiently patient the white people will get the floors of the tenements swept this is the movements conceptual infirmity as it assumes that the black man like a wooden puppet cannot move until the master has pulled the strings it is not clear how great is the investment the white american has in this artifactitious negro character his misgivings over black_power would indicate that the investment being built up over centuries is great indeed if this is so then this country is faced with a great crisis for it is highly unlikely that the faulty assumptions of the civil_rights movement will ever again claim the allegianceif it ever didof any significant number of black americans there is then no choice between civil_rights and black_power the choice is between black_power and the utter alienation that leads to wanton destruction of people and property the sooner the white press and politicians realize this the sooner will they be able to begin the arduous task of cultivating in the minds of the generality of white men a healthy and necessary respect for black humanity 
the creative possibilities of black_power
by dr nathan wright jr
theme of black_power in spite of  much recent publicity q  is not new on the  american scene nor is it likely in the foreseeable future to come to a definite end regardless of the outcome of the current debate concerning the propriety of the term black_power black_power has been a continuing refrain in the history of the american negro the slave uprisings which were more frequent than historians often relate continually reiterated the black_power theme it was the clarion call of the rebel john brown and of the abolitionist frederick douglass again the sophisticated and angered web du bois and the militant visionary marcus garvey addressed themselves to the issue of the black mans cooperative strength and dignity and a philip randolphs brotherhood of sleeping car porters came together held together and became a major leverage in american political and economic life through a commitment to what militants today speak of as black_power to what precisely does the theme black_power speak in the negro churches it has most often addressed itself to a kind of black solidarity in a holy war where in an imminent latter day the saints of light who have withstood the evil onslaughts of the powers of darkness will receive their due reward howard thurman in his recent and perhaps his greatest book the luminous darkness speaks of the perception of his early youth that white humanity was beyond the pale of his morality such widespread feelings of the mystical uniqueness of the negro in his corporate life have been the backdrop for the political thrusts which we identify most often as black_power in its first several decades of militancy the national association for the advancement of colored people could be fairly identified with  the alleged dissidents of today who speak of the critical force of the negros united strength reference to such an idea today is subjected to the frequent criticism that it is open to misunderstanding is subject to individual interpretation and therefore may be misleading as black_power speaksas it has done over several centuriesto the negros recognition and aggressive assertion of his own fundamental sense of dignity integrity and worth it would and must have at least flexibile implications for no two individuals can perceive of and assert their own validity and place in precisely identical ways the belligerent by nature will tend to express his own sense of being and relationship in bellicose ways the more temperate will tend to use more temperate means nonetheless there may be an apparently realistic danger in a mass rallying to the theme of black_power the negro people over the years have been encouraged by  many means to suppress and sublimate their natural feelings of conflict and frustration in this light under a longpostponed and newfound freedom the potential catharsis inherent in the current call to the banners of black_power may be fraught with not unexpected and painful excess black_power may be seen to be a logical and perhaps muchneeded expression of the negros awakening to selfawareness by an overlydelayed and awkward stretching of his arms and flexing of his muscles as he looks half yet untested and unmeasured politibewildered at his newly felt but as cal and moral strength 
are negroes ready for black_power
interestingly those who oppose the use of the term black_power have often raised the objection that negroes court annihilation once black_power comes face to face with white power such a vision of the armed conflict of two opposing and ludicrously unequal camps represents both a misreading of the intent of those who espouse black_power and a failure to understand the necessary dynamics of social and moral progress ethnocentrism or the consciousness of ingroup solidarity with a consequent sense of pride and power is one of the strongest of human sentiments what an ingroup or an ethnic community may be is defined by the culture of which such a group is a part the american culture has defined a number of ethnic groups including notably the jews the irish and the scotchirish who represent religious national or a combination of religious and national groupings all of these groups have intensive pride in their own membership and this is given expression in a variety of ways there are several singular and significant differences in the circumstances of the negros place or role as an ethnic group in american life the negros ability to express his sense of pride has been circumscribed perhaps nowhere has this been more flagrant than in the wellnigh completely successful attempts of the white community with the encouragement and complicity of the nations social scientists to have the negro forget that he is by and large a europeanamerican indianblack african hybrid the negro has been encouraged to forgetas in my own familythat the hickmans and the wrights our family names were of british stock and that the varying shades of color and different textures of hair are a reflection of a variegated ethnic ancestry by culture almost completely and by race to a fairly considerable degree the overwhelming majority of american negroes are of a european background yet the negros sense of limited racial and cultural pride has been restricted to his supposed african origins in a veiled and uncertain past rare is the writer of an american textbook in sociology or history who attributes to the negro anything other than pure african descent except in the semiderogtory sense of illegitimacy even here illegitimacy is an occurrence common to family strains and is simply heightened in varying degrees and by diverse means among the rootless and the oppressed black_power may be seen to be a form of ethnocentrism albeit falling into a trap set by the historically racistbound american culture with the complicity of social scientists who inevitably tend to operate hopefully with some objectively within the accepted frameworks of the society of which they are a part the negros sense of pride is further blunted by the seemingly unamerican assumption that the negros position of social and economic inferiority is immutable the last hiredfirst fired concept here may be seen to be not the multiplication of individual behavior but the logical expression of the mind of a way of life which rejects the negros sense of worth the negro himself has purchased stock in this endeavor partly by recoil in selfdefense and in part by imposed design the american negro has eschewed social equality no major civil_rights leader even today espouses as a major plank in his platform social equality at the very heart of which is the matter of intermarriage yet even economic survival and advancement as well as a sense of pride depend in no small degree upon relationships of a blood and legal variety negroes today are isolated from the jobs not only at the bottom of the ladder but from those so desperately needed at the top to begin a closing of the economic gap admittedly by an absence of contacts whom one knows is for white americans as important as what one knows for negro americans the failure to know people in those intimate and familial relationships which spell care and concern and mutual economic responsibility means no less than a growing fact of isolation from the economic and social fruits of american life which are theoretically their due inheritance the renewed impetus towards the concept of black_power here reflects the apparent readiness of many negro americans to give a perhaps still illusory implementation to their now hoarse and hackneyed and desperate cry of all here now  
are negroes willing to be aggressive
a story is told of an advertisement for what was billed to be the most unusual show on earth the day came finally for the great performance and an audience in curious expectancy was treated to a oneminute show of symbolic behaviour twelve negroes were simply tugging hard at a rope when those who had come for the show demanded an explanation the producer simply asked where on earth have you ever seen twelve negroes pulling together what is apparently true of the american negro is true of all ethnic groups people are all unique and only at critical and measured points do corporate interests emerge for the negro this has been both bane and blessing hence with the current controversy over the use of the term black_power a consensus is sought where no agreement need legitimately exist the fact is that in spite of the massive economic and social signs and indications of the monumental failure of the american people to close the gap in any significant way between where negroes are in relation to their white counterpartsmany negroes are content with the current drift and trend of things negroes as all americans are generally better off today than they were at the end of world war ii the awareness of this fact leads not only many negroes representative of the man in the street but also a substantial portion of recognized negro leadership to speak with apparent integrity of the progress and gains which negroes are making yet the american economy generally has been growing by greater degrees than has the negros alleged progress this leads other negroes of a different type of perceptiveness and of equal integrity to reject the term progress with as great a degree of disdain as that with which some have rejected the term black_power the willingness to speak to the affirmative implications of black_power may be in a wellnigh precise relationship to ones conception of negro progress on this issue negroes are not and doubtless will not be agreed the figures for the relative income of nonwhites in relations to whites over a recent fifteenyear period are as follows                               the fact that there is no clear statistical trend suggests thateven if the figures may be radically improved for  to the idea of a relative and secure indication of progress is for the negro an illusory reality  further the current programs under the auspices of the office of economic opportunity and the extensive efforts of private and civic agencies on behalf of negro employment and upgrading are all in the direction largely of lower echelon and madework jobs these serve a basic and absolutely necessary purpose of enabling negroes to survive and of postponing the day of massive revolt in our present circumstance this is no mean purpose and must be given the fullest encouragement at every hand nonetheless the catapulting of significant numbers of the available qualified negroes into positions of high economic value and extensive influence at policymaking levels in our business educational and civic structure remains neglected in a way which may prove to have perilous proportions a sad fact which must be contemplated by all is that in spite of all of our efforts in the negros behalf in the recent past his relative stake in the benefit levels in the american good life have not improved at the same time that his perceptions of his own worth and due inheritance have tremendously increased this suggests the possibility of a heightened sense of polarization within the negro community with numbers of middleclass negroes having bettered their status being understandably under the illusion and spell of progress by the tangible and unmistakable reality of their own personal progress on the other hand however there may be in the days ahead growing masses of the disinherited feeling isolated and neglected believing themselves to be forgotten by their  traditional leadership and ever more willing to spell out in word and deed the implications of black_power in terms of the frustration and depth of deprivation which they perceive to make their lot some economists believe that the economic system which is traditional to our culture calls for a fluid reservoir of untapped resource at its base if such a reservoir is neededas may be realistically perceived to be the case from its sustained existencethe rudimentary economic problem becomes a potentially explosive social problem when the group at the bottom is not heterogeneous being entirely of one group comprising both welltrained and some who should be there all through a sense of social injustice such has been the negros plight even with increased education statistically only a relatively small proportion of the economic gap is closed in most communities of america it remains true that only after most white unemployed find employment are the unemployed among negroes given basic consideration hence in our large cities there has been a recent rise from a  per cent to a  per cent unemployment rate among negroes between the ages of  and  while the rates for white youth in the same category have been going steadily down the differing lots of negro americans have thus brought about differing attitudes toward the problems of the present and the future human nature historically has not been fundamentally altruistic in terms of sharing power altruism has the sweep of its depth and breadth within the strict limits of our basically keeping the things that we have thus to hope for the aspiring and upwardly mobile negro and those in the secure white community to voluntarily side totally with those who perceive of themselves as the disinherited may represent the height of folly the cry black_power says my share for some for others it gives the totally unfounded illusion of threatening their accustomed or hopefully to be increased abundance 
can black_power really work
the question of the feasibility of the use of black_power is mainly a rhetorical one the perceptions of the relative threat or advantage which others pose for us is always with us further power in terms of human dynamics cannot be calculated always in terms of numbers and this is especially true where morality is perceived to lie at the heart of the matter it is not a matter of whether negroes can express black_power but one of must in the sense that the negroas all who would grow up into responsible selfhood must domust give assertion to his own inherent sense of worth and being several centuries of admittedly crippling segregation and discrimination have not left the american negro unaffected he has been limited in this evil process and it is he alone who must stake his claim to the worth which for centuries he has been denied in this task of giving expression to his own newfound selfrealiza tion the american negro must stand alone no one may do this for him or with him it is so with our children in our own households it is true also with rising social groups here one may appropriate the famed analogy of booker t washington in claiming that today all americanswhite and blackmust be as one as the hand in all that pertains to the extension of the corporate national good life but we must be as separate as the fingers of the hand in the doing of that which each group must do for itself the staking of its claim in its own unpredictable and variegated way to its own due dignity and worth what then is the white mans role it is a changeless law of human life that each man must claim for himself the dignity of his own adulthood those who would deny to the negro this privilege would consciously or unconsciously will for the negro that he be less than what he should be what he would do for himself today has been the privilege of all other americans since the shot heard around the world if the black man has any power of place in american life it is black_power and so the term is simply descriptive of a contemporary and hopefully growing reality in american life as the negros response to the term black_power is mixed so is that of the white community many would applaud what they perceive as the negros coming at last into his own others who have been close to the american negroand who may find themselves in positions of worthy and much needed influence in our national and local civil_rights groupsmay understandably regret the current impetus toward black_power thus to carry the analogy of growth into adulthood further the lament of the white liberal and consequently of organizations in which he has significant control may be not unlike the lament of a foster parent who contemplates losing as a child the one to whom he has become accustomed to giving succour in the movement toward black_power the white liberals perceived reluctance must be understood and appreciated therefore as the difference of one who historically has extended the hand of friendship and upon whose help once the dust of selfassertion has settled the negro must continue to rely to what strategic endsaside  from eventual growth and an ultimate furtherance of selfrespect can the movement toward black_power lead there are at least several  national selfinterest the negros current restless and aggressive protest points in an as yet relatively mild and presently selfdestructive way to what may well be the massive irrational ultimate and widespread response to the continued arbitrary isolation of the masses of the nations negro poor from economic mainstream of american life either we develop all the nations human resources for their full productive potential and then open opportunities for their effective utilization for our mutual benefit or we create liabilities which become a sustained unnecessary and geometrically increasing burden upon both this and succeeding generations in this light the contemporary impetus toward black_power may be seen to be a restorative and conserving force in american life calling america to save itself from the folly of a myopic vision of what america in human terms is destined and called to be  urban improvement the life of our cities needs to be redeemed the negros often angered protest represent the claim that social palliatives in our cities no longer apply and that new and fundamentally creative answers must be found for the sores which fester in the heart of our cities life our urban schools with their contemporary racial unrest remind us that the basic planning and administration of any enterprise at every level must be sensitive to and representative of the concerns of those who are served schools with proprietors as removed from their constituents as our urban systems tend now to be may be seen to be as potentially insidious as the urban system of absentee landlords marginal insights the negros present protest speaks to neglected dimensions of the meaning of democracy thrust to a considerable degree outside the center of american life the negro may be seen to be in a unique and enviable position of bringing new and saving perspectives to basic issues in our national life one such area to which his own pleas for an audience before the bar of american good judgment is that of the extension of the meaning of equality our religious and national heritage as well as the persistent experience of family life speaks to the equitable principle of taking from each as he is able and providing for each as is his need those who may be perceived to be benighted deserve our richest and best resources in enabling them to progress toward standing alone can a truly democratic society reach for less than this humane goal by virtue of his rich experience at the margin of american life we must demand of the american negro that through his fresh insights he ennoble as best he can the common inheritance to which we owe allegiance here a uniquely black_power may be seen to provide rich resources for us all changed status inevitably a declaration of a changed perception of his own position creates a changed racial situation with an altered nature to the problem new challenges await us which can assuredly do no less than provide some new groundwork in exchange for the old from which little that can be called true progress was achieved new conditions and uncharted paths are always fraught with peril we cannot foretell what the future holds in specific or detailed way for any implication or consequence of the impetus toward black_power but the assertion of human dignity and worthas we may learn from experience with our own sons and daughterswhile creating times of testing are productive of much good and growth and gain it is in the confidence and hope that the days ahead as well as the more distant future may be entrusted with its own problems that we built today the human aspect of our corporate life it is in this context that possibly we may come to see and accept as a creative necessity the current focus on black_power  
 to the leaders of america power and freedom
is of critical importance that the leaders of this nation listen also to a voice which says that the principal source of the  threat to our nation comes neither from the riots erupting cb g our cities nor from the disagreements among the lead ers of the civil_rights movement nor even from mere raising of the cry for black_power these events we believe are but the expression of the judgment of god upon our nation for its failure to use its abundant resources to serve the real wellbeing of people at home and abroad we give our full support to all civil_rights leaders as they seek for basically american goals for we are not convinced that their mutual reinforcement of one another in the past is bound to end in the future we would hope that the public power of our nation will be used to strengthen the civil_rights movement and not to manipulate or further fracture it we deplore the overt violence of riots but we believe it is more important to focus on the real sources of these eruptions these sources may be abetted inside the ghetto but their basic causes lie in the silent and covert violence which white middleclass america inflicts upon the victims of the inner city the hidden smooth and often smiling decisions of american leaders which tie a white noose of suburbia around the necks and which pin the backs of the masses of negroes against the steaming ghetto wallswithout jobs in a booming economy with dilapidated and segregated educational systems in the full view of unenforced laws against it in short the failure of american leaders to use american power to create equal opportunity in life as well as in lawthis is the real problem and not the anguished cry for black_power from the point of view of the christian faith there is nothing necessarily wrong with concern for power at the heart of the protestant reformation is the belief that ultimate power belongs to god alone and that men become most inhuman when concentrations of power lead to the convictionovert or covertthat any nation race or organization can rival god in this regard at issue in the relations between whites and negroes in america is the problem of inequality of power out of this imbalance grows the disrespect of white men for the negro personality and community and the disrespect of negroes for themselves this is a fundamental root of human injustice in america in one sense the concept of black_power reminds us of the need for and the possibility of authentic democracy in america we do not agree with those who say that we must cease expressing concern for the acquisition of power lest we endanger the gains already made by the civil_rights movement the fact of the matter is there have  been few substantive gains since about  in this area the gap has constantly widened between the incomes of nonwhites relative to the whites since the supreme court decision of  de facto segregation in every major city in our land has increased rather than decreased since the middle of the s unemployment among negroes has gone up rather than down while unemployment has decreased in the white community while there has been some progress in some areas for equality for negroes this progress has been limited mainly to middleclass negroes who represent only a small minority of the larger negro community these are the hard facts that we must all face together therefore we must not take the position that we can continue in the same old paths when american leaders decide to serve the real welfare of people instead of war and destruction when american leaders are forced to make the rebuilding of our cities first priority on the nations agenda when american leaders are forced by the american people to quit misusing and abusing american power then will the cry for black_power become inaudible for the framework in which all power in america operates would include the power and experience of black men as well as those of white men in that way the fear of the power of each group would be removed america is our beloved homeland but america is not god only god can do everything america and the other nations of the world must decide which among a number of alternatives they will choose ii to white churchmen power and love as black men who were long ago forced out of the white church to create and to wield black_power we fail to understand the emotional quality of the outcry of some clergy against the use of the term today it is not enough to answer that integration is the solution for it is precisely the nature of the operation of power under some forms of integration which is being challenged the negro church was created as a result of the refusal to submit to the indignities of a false kind of integration in which all power was in the hands of white people a more equal sharing of power is precisely what is required as the precondition of authentic human interaction we understand the growing demand of negro and white youth for a more honest kind of integration one which increases rather than decreases the capacity of the disinherited to participate with power in all of the structures of our common life without this capacity to participate with powerie to have some organized political and economic strength to really influence people with whom one interacts integration is not meaningful for the issue is not one of racial balance but of honest interracial interaction for this kind of interaction to take place all people need power whether black or white we regard as sheer hypocrisy or as a blind and dangerous illusion the view that opposes love to power love should be a controlling element in power but what love opposes is precisely the misuse and abuse of power not power itself so long as white churchmen continue to moralize and misinterpret christian love so long will justice continue to be subverted in this land iii to negro citizens power and justice both the anguished cry for black_power and the confused emotional response to it can be understood if the whole controversy is put in the context of american history especially must we understand the irony involved in the pride of americans regarding their ability to act as individuals on the one hand and their tendency to act as members of ethnic groups on the other hand in the tensions of this part of our history is revealed both the tragedy and the hope of human redemption in america america has asked its negro citizens to fight for opportunity as individuals whereas at certain points in our history what we have needed most has been opportunity for the whole group not just for selected and approved negroes thus in  the slaves were made legally free as individuals but the real question regarding personal and group power to maintain that freedom was pushed aside power at that time for a mainly rural people meant land and tools to work the land in the words of thaddeus stevens power meant  acres and a mule but this power was not made available to the slaves and we see the results today in the pushing of a landless peasantry off the farms into big cities where they come in search mainly of the power to be free what they find are only the formalities of unenforced legal freedom so we must ask what is the nature of the power which we seek and need today power today is essentially organizational power it is not a thing lying about in the streets to be fought over it is a thing which in some measure already belongs to negroes and which must be developed by negroes in relationship with the great resources of this nation getting power necessarily involves reconciliation we must first be reconciled to ourselves lest we fail to recognize the resources we already have and upon which we can build we must be reconciled to ourselves as persons and to ourselves as an historical group this means we must find our way to a new self image in which we can feel a normal sense of pride in self including our variety of skin color and the manifold textures of our hair as long as we are filled with hatred for ourselves we will be unable to respect others at the same time if we are seriously concerned about power then we must build upon that which we already have black_power is already present to some extent in the negro church in negro fraternities and sororities in our professional associations and in the opportunities afforded to negroes who make decisions in some of the integrated organizations of our society we understand the reasons by which these limited forms of black_power have been rejected by some of our people too often the negro church has stirred its members away from the reign of god in this world to a distorted and complacent view of an other worldly conception of gods power we commit ourselves as churchmen to make more meaningful in the life of our institution our conviction that jesus christ reigns in the here and now as well as in the future he brings in upon us we shall therefore use more of the resources of our churches in working for human justice in the places of social change and upheaval where our master is already at work at the same time we would urge that negro social and professional organizations develop new roles for engaging the problem of equal opportunity and put less time into the frivolity of idle chatter and social waste we must not apologize for the existence of this form of group power for we have been oppressed as a group not as individuals we will not find our way out of that oppression until both we and america accept the need for negro americans as well as for jews italians poles and white anglosaxon protestants among others to have and to wield group power however if power is sought merely as an end in itself it tends to turn upon those who seek it negroes need power in order to participate more effectively at all levels of the life of our nation we are glad that none of those civil_rights leaders who have asked for black_power have suggested that it means a new form of isolationism or a foolish effort at domination but we must be clear about why we need to be reconciled with the white majority it is not because we are only onetenth of the population in america for we do not need to be reminded of the awesome power wielded by the  majority we see and feel that power every day in the destructions heaped upon our families and upon the nations cities we do not need to be threatened by such cold and heartless statements for we are men not children and we are growing out of our fear of that power which can hardly hurt us any more in the future than it does in the present or has in the past moreover those bare figures conceal the potential political strength which is ours if we organize properly in the big cities and establish effective alliances neither must we rest our concern for reconciliation with our white brothers on the fear that failure to do so would damage gains already made by the civil_rights movement if those gains are in fact real they will withstand the claims of our people for power and justice not just for a few select negroes here and there but for the masses of our citizens we must rather rest our concern for reconciliation on the firm ground that we and all other americans are one our history and destiny are indissolubly linked if the future is to belong to any of us it must be prepared for all of us whatever our racial or religious background for in the final analysis we are persons and the power of all groups must be wielded to make visible our common humanity the future of america will belong to neither white nor black unless all americans work together at the task of rebuilding our cities we must organize not only among ourselves but with other groups in order that we can together gain power sufficient to change this nations sense of what is now important and what must be done now we must work with the remainder of the nation to organize whole cities for the task of making the rebuilding of our cities first priority in the use of our resources this is more important than who gets to the moon first or the war in vietnam to accomplish this task we cannot expend our energies in spastic or illtempered explosions without meaningful goals we must move from the politics of philanthropy to the politics of metropolitan development for equal opportunity we must relate all groups of the city together in new ways in order that the truth of our cities might be laid bare and in order that together we can lay claim to the great resources of our nation to make truth more human iv to the mass media power and truth the ability or inability of all people in america to understand the upheavals of our day depends greatly on the way power and truth operate in the mass media during the southern demonstrations for civil_rights young men of the communications industry performed an invaluable service for the entire country by revealing plainly to our ears and eyes the ugly truth of a brutalizing system of overt discrimination and segregation many of you were mauled and injured and it took courage for you to stick with the task you were instruments of change and not merely purveyors of unrelated facts you were able to do this by dint of personal courage and by reason of the power of national news agencies which supported you today however your task and ours is more difficult the truth that needs revealing today is not so clearcut in its outlines nor is there a national consensus to help you form relevant points of view therefore nothing is now more important than that you look for a variety of sources of truth in order that the limited perspectives of all of us might be corrected just as you related to a broad spectrum of people in mississippi  instead of relying only on police records and establishment figures so must you operate in new york city chicago and cleveland the power to support you in this endeavor is present in our country it must be searched out we desire to use our limited influence to help relate you to the variety of experience in the negro community so that limited controversies are not blown up into the final truth about us the fate of this country is to no small extent dependent upon how you interpret the crises upon us so that human truth is disclosed and human needs are met 
a new white backlash
here came to light not j ritn £ l°ng ago a pathetic  ii £ document that illustrates the total alienation of the militant young negro and his pitiful inability to understand or cope with his problems the documentbelieved to provide the basis for the current uproar about black_powerwas drawn up last winter by stokely carmichael and some other young rebels of the student nonviolent coordinating committee and it dealt with the question of whether white people should play any major role in the civilrights movement no argued the militants if we are to proceed toward true liberation we must cut overselves off from white people we must form our own institutions credit unions coops political parties write our own histories  if we continue to rely upon white financial support we will find ourselves entwined in the tentacles of the white power complex that controls this country    we reject the american dream as defined by white people and must work to construct an american reality defined by afroamericans this all sounds very fierce but the motive for this paranoid selfsegregation lies in an openly acknowledged feara fear of white people and a fear of ones own fear in arguing for the exclusion of whites from negro meetings the supposed militants offer the explanation that blacks    feel intimidated by the presence of whites because of their knowledge of the power that whites have over their lives  a climate has to be created whereby blacks can express themselves the reason that whites must be excluded is not that one is antiwhite but that the efforts that one is trying to achieve cannot succeed because whites have an intimidating effect in this frightened definition of their own cause the tactically naive militants of black_power sound less like the cutting edge of the civilrights movement than like the advocates of defeat they resemble those ideologyridden dogmatists both oldguard conservatives and oldguard socialistswho prefer purity to victory who prefer no solution to partial solutions if power requires mass support then the rejection of anyones support means less power and if power requires money then the rejection of anyones money means less power and in this light the program for black_power is a program for black weakness and failure at the same time that the negro militants were talking about black_power in vague terms that show little connection between effort and result the more moderate rev martin_luther_king jr was leading his troops into the very center of the conflictand in a demonstration for desegregated housing in chicago he was met with a barrage of stones bottles and other flying debris it is significant that kings efforts to achieve a reasonable goal by physical demonstrations were finally confronted by brute force and it is significant that kings demonstrators were outnumbered by more than six to one for that is a smallscale version of the relationship of militant white power to militant black_power nor was chicago the only place where northern whites have resorted to force to counteract negro agitation whites too have their urban ghettos their fears and frustrations and mob lusts and it is worth remembering that in the great detroit race riots of  the army had to be called in to stop the white mobs from a rampage that would have made the watts rioting seem like a musicalcomedy hoedown it is possible indeed that the violence in chicago coming just a fortnight after the standard negro outbreak inaugurates a whole new phase of the civilrights struggle we have been so bemused for so long by talk about the negro revolution that we tend to assume that revolutionaries must be granted their just demands and even their unjust demands and that revolutions are inevitably triumphant it is not true the english revolution ended with king charles ii on the throne and oliver cromwells head exhibited on a pike the french revolution too ended with the bourbons back in power in our own time the shanghai revolutionaries of  were boiled alive germanys karl liebknecht ended in a muddy ditch and a soviet firing squad silenced imre nagys hopes of presiding over a free hungary since the first slave revolts of ancient egypt the history of this earth is in large part a history of rights denied and revolutions crushed in our own country then the danger is not simply the increasing extremism of the negroes but the potential extremism of the vast majority of whites who feeling crowded and threatened are only too ready to suppress this fragile revolution with all the violence at hand we are all let us face it mississippians we all fervently wish that the negro problem did not exist or that if it must exist it could be ignored confronted with the howling need for decent schools jobs housing and all the other minimum rights of the american system we will do our best in a halfhearted way to correct old wrongs the hand may be extended grudgingly and patronizingly but anyone who rejects that hand rejects his own best interests for minimum rights are the only rights that we are willing to guarantee and above those minimum rights there is and will continue to be a vast area of discrimination and inequity and unfairness the area in which we claim the most basic right of all the right to be stupid and prejudiced the right to make mistakes the right to be less and worse than we pretend the right to be ourselves when this majority right is threatened the majority will react accordinglywith results that could be disastrous to all of us

columnists and comf mentators are making much of the socalled white backlash against the civil_rights movement they argue with uncommon unanimity that the stiffening resistance of white people against negro demands as exemplified in the large vote for alabamas segregationist governor in wisconsin indiana and maryland represents a significant loss of sympathy among whites for the cause of equal rights the assumption supporting this proposition is that there existed prior to the eruption of school boycotts sitins lieins stallins and the ascendancy of negro militants a great store of sincere goodwill toward negroes on the part of most  northern whites and this is almost  per cent pure myth if such goodwill did exist for negroes among northern whites then how was it manifested was it translated into activity designed at lowering racial barriers against negroes in the norththese are important questions for the key to the nature of the whole crisis of civil_rights in the north lies imbedded in the answers and yet these are questions few of the editors and analysts are asking the simple fact is thathad such goodwill been prevalent among northern whitesthere would never have developed any need for boycotts and demonstrations and the moderate and responsible negro leaders like roy wilkins of the naacp would never have been eclipsed by the extremists if northern white people generally favored equal rights for negroes then there would have existed no racial barriers in the craft unions no nonnegro hiring policies by many industrial firms no practice of keeping negroes in menial jobs in those firms where they are hired no exclusion of qualified negroes from middleclass or white residential areas and therefore no allnegro schools with facilities equipment and instruction demonstrably inferior to that in predominantly white schools those who argue insistently that negro militance has hurt the negro cause neglect to offer convincing evidence in support of their argument it may be that such evidence is in fact quite small and difficult to come by it is even possible that the argument is used largely as a club with which to dis courage the growing nuisance of demonstrations viewed from the negro side of americas racial wall the proposition that there is a white backlash against the civil_rights movement takes on the character of a particularly insidious canard just what are these proponents of the white backlash theory up to anyway are they genuinely concerned that white sympathizers with the negro cause may abandon the struggle or are they attempting ever so subtly to blackmail negroes into submission surely any honest observer of the civil_rights scene who is capable of even moderately accurate perception must know by now that the white community tends to act in favor of negro rights only in the face of concerted negro pressure rare indeed are the instances where white authority bows to the principle of total equality of the races on its own initiative it is true that northern whites are reacting with some vehemence to the disruption of the status quo but are those who interpret this as a backlash unconsciously equating the status quo with the conditions of amicable race relations to negroes it would certainly seem so many of the whites who now are claiming disaffection with the negro cause because of some excesses on the part of some civil_rights activists or groups are actually revealing their own latent condescension prejudice and intolerance they are in effect seeking to punish all negroes for the behavior of a few negroes which is precisely the excuse southern racists have always employed now these people may proclaim themselves friends of negroes if they choose to but it is extremely unlikely that negroes have ever thought of them as friends this of course is another way of stating the dilemma of the liberal many whites who think of themselves as being friends to negroes would be embarrassed to read what amounts to a description of themselves in a book written by enlightened virginia aristocrat lewis harvie blair back in  directing his words to those fellowpatricians who protested that they were gentle and helpful to negroes lewis harvie blair wrote in a southern prophecy but we forget that our kindness to the negroes proceeds from the standpoint of condescension and of assumed caste superiority and we expect it to be received with humility and from a feeling of acknowledged caste inferiority and if not so received by the negroes they are thought impudent and impertinent and the foundation of our kindness dries up the cause of justice and equality is either right or it is not and if it is right it does not become wrong because of the behavior of some individuals or groups concerned with it to say to negroes that their cause is just only so long as they behave in a way to deserve equality is not only to insult negro citizens but it is also to ascribe to white people precisely those powers over negroes which no citizen can have over another in a free society the point is that those who are defecting from support of negroes are those whose support was only token to begin with not only do those whites who believe in real equality still give unqualified support to the cause they also understand how and why many negroes are resorting to extremism these white people are not racists which is to say that they do not assign human rights and values according to race and therefore they are able to put themselves in the negros shoes and having done so they know that nothing short of death would prevent them from insisting that they have the same rights and privileges as all other americans and looking at the prowallace vote in wisconsin indiana and maryland from this viewpoint it is possible to be cheered rather than depressed by the results if wallaces pull of onethird of the vote really means that this proportion of the people oppose negro equality then it also means that the other twothirds are willing to accept negro equality indeed if the vote means any such thing it amounts to a great victory for the cause of equal rights in those two states of course no such optimism is justified what the country is finally facing are the consequences of its own timidity hypocrisy and neglect americans in no section of the country have ever been subjected to any intensive coaching in the honoring of negro rights quite the opposite has been true and even some conservative observers are getting around to admitting as much in a recent column in the chicago daily news john m johnston wrote nobody who reads the papers should be surprised by the wallace phenomenon it was not by oversight that a hundred years have gone by without spelling out the privileges of citizenship for negroes as is now being attempted in washington indeed it was not i suggest that when the full impact of the meaning of the negro revolution dawns on white america the vote in favor of states rights and against goverment interference will be even greater than that recorded in the recent wisconsin and indiana primaries for negroes are in no popularity contest and they are not asking for tolerance negroes are insisting upon their rights as free citizens furthermore it is highly unlikely that negroes will be impressed by the endless admonitions of moderation and pleas for restraint directed at them by whites white people have been telling negroes to wait for their full rights for over a hundred years in fact it is precisely because negroes failed to insist upon their full and equal rights  in the north that many of the racial restrictions now prevailing came to harden into custom many people believe for instance that the question of housing segregationundoubtedly a central concern in the nations racial dilemmais a relatively new and particularly delicate consideration in the overall problem but such is not the case the basic federal law on housing was passed nearly a century ago in  it provided a year in prison a fine of  or both for those who violated the following provision all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property however in the south custom was joined by brutal suppression in the conspiracy against negro rights writing recently in the reporter of the great racist reaction that overtook the country in the s historian c vann woodward had this to say in the south the reaction found expression in whitesupremacy propaganda segregation laws poll taxes literacy and poverty tests white primaries and other devises for disfranchising the negroes it was accompanied by an increase in lynching riots and other forms of violence against the minority race it resulted in driving the negro from all forums and avenues of political life in stripping him of many of the civil_rights and defenses he had gained through the reconstruction amendments and in reducing him to a despised and segregated outcast well negroes now are calling for a redress of all those grievances and it is the nations challengenot his aloneto see that the grievances are redressed with honor and dispatch in recent years liberals have replaced segregationists as the prime targets of negro ire writers like james baldwin and leroi jones have gone so far as to picture the liberals as millstones around the negros neck and poet calvin hernton flatly blamed the failure of white liberals for the rise of the black muslims these attacks of course were not leveled at genuine liberals who are relatively few but at that vast army of americans who mistake a patronizing attitude however subtle for a liberal conviction what most of these people mean when they say they are friends of negroes is that they dont mind negroes as long as negroes stay in their place and that place invariably turns out to be somewhere other than where full and unconditional rights of citizenship are a reality in other words these liberals tend to balk and to reject their convictions at the point where negroes insist on being simply men and women like any others with precisely the same rights privileges and obligations as other men and women and so whites in the metropolitan areas of the north are being flushed out into the openforced to go on recordrelative to their true racial attitudes it was one thing to strike a liberal pose in favor of negro rights so long as what was involved only amounted to a question of unsegregated seating on a southern bus or free use of a public park or even unrestricted service at a sandwich counter but it is quite another matter when this liberality is put to the acid test in terms of jobs schools and housing areas where some adjustment and possible inconvenience on the liberals part is required to make negro equality an unqualified reality white analysts of the civil_rights movement may choose to see a great white backlash but negroes remain unconvinced there is no surprise for negroes in the revelation of widespread bigotry among white people north or south what is happening is that the two major races in this country have arrived at the inevitable confrontation this is the true meaning of this moment this is the service governor george wallace of alabama is rendering to americans he is bringing us closer to the longpostponed moment of truth the time has come when white people are going to have to decide whether they are to be guided by the principles of justice and equality as spelled out in the constitution and bill of rights or whether they are going to submit this system of government to the rationale of racism we are now witnessing the weedingout process the separation of the true believers from the hypocrites from now until the resolution of the race problem one way or another white people will find it increasingly difficult to cloak their desire for white privilege in robes of genteel patronage  	
malcolm the martyr 
by clarence major
ven if nothing else in
e
y americas social and
£ political fabric justif
fied and promised the
necessity of malcolm
x the words of thomas jefferson
would be sufficient
if there be any among us who
wish to dissolve this union or
change its republican form let
them stand undisturbed as monuments
of the safety with which error
of opinion may be tolerated
where reason is left free to combat
it
but of course much more justified
his existence though one
cannot be sure yet how important
his death will be for struggling men
everywhere
i must confess that i expected
malcolm to be a great deal more
dynamic in appearance than he
was he was striking all right
even engrossing but my myth of
him was already very big and the
man had yet to fulfill it in human
image nevertheless the personal
encounter remained a gripping one
in talking with a white woman
about malcolms personal appearance
in omaha it was related t
 this reporter that he turned out to be from her point of view not nearly as militant not nearly as proviolence as she had been led by the press to believe however my informant was a confirmed socialist ive wondered for a long time in considering malcolms sincerity in his struggle for human rights for afroamericans if he realized fully surely he must have how intrinsic racism is to america or for that matter to western civilization one begins to suspect a relationship between racism and capitalism is it any accident that the word wrong contains the letters ngro excepting e but including w and the word right contains the letters ight excepting the letter w but including the r could this be a linguistical accident you know negro and white vranger hwit never mind it was late in the day of the day malcolm was assassinated before i heard anything about it and then it was over the radio and there were several white people writers and admirers of writers in my living room drinking beer they had heard of his death earlier but no one had thought to mention it to me and my reaction was intense then the white girl near me said im so glad he wasnt killed by whites theres already so much tension between the races   he perhaps knew the depth of racism in the west but by the end  of his life he began to see with faith a brotherhood of all men after his second trip to mecca why wasnt the white girl concerned about his death rather than in who killed him the answer seems obvious the account of that trip to mecca in his autobiography reveals a very honest sensitive and intelligent man whos death certainly did not deserve such a casual remark as came from the white girl in my home what makes it more significant is that the girl knew these facts from having read his bookat least in partas it appeared in a magazine but one does not begin to believe that malcolm had for even a moment accepted the tokenism offered at home in america he wanted and still insisted on nothing short of full human rights and meanwhile he was trying to interest various powers in bringing the united states before a world court to be tried for undeniable crimes against black people which recalls to mind that aborted we charge genocide a petition to the united nations civil_rights congress ny  though extremely militant to the end he had begun to gain respect at home as a sincere voice esquire and post used him on their covers and literary and political journals carried transcripts of his speeches and articles about him and his ideas in a brilliant review of malcolms autobiography john woodford stated no man has risen from his societys dunghills to shine with more purity of purpose to scorch the blinking eyes of those who would not see a nation continually perpetuating a racist crime and to illuminate the paths of retribution more brilliantly than did malcolm_x    we had to have malcolm and we shall have other malcolms his dream of justice for the black man and the brotherhood of all men are not to be taken lightly if one is concerned with the challenge of our times and the terrible condition the white man has put himself in i realized this when malcolm came to omaha to speak as i listened to him these thoughts were going through me on a brief tv news film before he spoke the revolutionary malcolm used the phrase afroamerican in an interview with a white reporter and the guy thought the pronationalist meant some group other than the socalled negro malcolm smiled to himself i think i know what he felt and thought at that moment looking at that chump rev r e mcnair rev kelsey jones and others of the citizens coordinating committee for civil liberties had invited minister malcolm to omaha to speak anyway these were christians who had invited a muslim to address them all over america black christians and civil_rights workers were turning away from the promise of the establishment the promise was apparently empty a negro man asked malcolm if the whites who had helped in the civil_rights struggle were not sincere malcolm explained that he felt they would do well to work in the white communities toward improvement of their own miserable white attitudes a white man asked malcolm why he left christianity for islam and the latter answered that if what jesus taught is christianity he had never seen any of it in america this answer brought a loud ovation from the black members of the audience i remembered that big redas malcolm was once calledhad already said at harvard the christian world has failed to give the black  million exslaves justice for over  years of free slave labor despite this we have been better christians even than those who taught us christianity we have been americas most faithful servant during peace time and her bravest soldiers during war time and still white christians have been unable to recognize us and accept us as fellow human beings today we can see that the christian religon of the caucasian race has failed us thus the black masses are turning away from the church back to the religion of islam asked what political system he favored malcolm said that he knew only this capitalistic one and it must he stressed suck somebodys blood to survive he added that the countries of europe were loosing their blood lines in their loss of control over colored peoples and thus the desperate and frantic erection of something called the common market and he also added as he had at harvard earlier already countries are cutting off american trade someone asked malcolm if he expected help from the colored nations of the world in the event of taking up arms in defense of human rights of black americans malcolm said we have friends who care about us and who are concerned for our freedom mao notwithstanding he said that all over the middle east and africa he was met with questions about the stranded black brother in the wilderness of the white mans north america youre not going to find all the whites on one side he said the white community was now split in its attitude toward the civil_rights issues whites who help us dont do so because they love usits only because they see the handwriting on the wall that were going to overtake them  the black population explosion not long after this occasion i talked with a young man who worked with students for a democratic society and he flatly stated that whites were pulling out of groups like sncc because of the stronger trend toward nationalism in the light of what malcolm said this is the very root of coercion weve had nothing but legal  tricks in the united states courts he said by staying in these courts you domesticate the situation by going to the international level youre taking america to a world court for redress his reasoning was in correlation with the great sociologist william graham sumners in that it was impossible to get justice for exslaves under a capitalistic system which is bom of slavery itself as he spoke he was a handsome figure he was just beginning to grow his mustache which by the time he was killed on february   now called dhabihu sacrifice day by some was long and pointed malcolm responded to the acute resolution of mao tsetung who offered unreserved support of the american negro in his struggle against white imperialism at omaha malcolm made it clear that he was in full favor of a real revolution in america the socialist white woman said to this reporter everything he said was just good common sense there was an unmistakable tone of warning in everything he said while the press people there seemed mad and fuzzy running up and down the aisles in the story of his life malcolm later had the same tone in words he knew he faced an evil monster and he knew he was going to die but he had a vision for his brothers on earth chinese would be the leading political tongue of the future and arabic the spiritual whites would not always dominate everybody on earth malcolm little was one of the first negro leaders to really see that any freedom movement not international in range and outlook was foredoomed to failure he is physically dead now but it only proved to us that he lives more fully in our quest one of the truly sad things though was when malcolms younger brother minister philbert wrote a denouncing article about him in the january   issue of muhammad speaks newspaper the article appeared on the same page with a cartoon showing malcolms head bouncing down the way of judas brutus and benedict arnold and in the same issue mr muhammad predicted a chastisement for the hypocrites how much do we ever know about the future malcolms half sister mrs ella collins stated i believe that his death was very well planned    there had to be inside connections the people involved in my brothers murder had to have contact with a person or persons whom malcolm trusted malcolm indicated to me before he died that he felt he was being betrayed the murder of my brother was much bigger than the black muslims black muslims did the job but with others this wasnt done by one group his death was planned even before he was refused entry into france had he lived through the summer of  he would have influenced great changes in america the power structure knew this his death was planned by the power structure of the west hers is the most chilling assessment yet he was liberated from the selfhate and shame which are the unfortunate lot of the masses and he was trying desperately to reach his brothers and sisters in the american ghetto who are still stewing in the fumes and burning from the cops bullets the west didnt give him a peace prize to cool him down but he reached the souls and minds of many black brothers who shall not let his name diewho shall not ever forget that dream of selfhood and nationalism he stood for claude brown the young highly successful man who wrote the book manchild in the promised land says you can call malcolm_x a madman a fanatic an extremistany of those thingsbut none of those categories erases him all i know is that an awful lot of negroes and i mean educated ones thought that malcolm was a cool and tough and dedicated cat whom you had to respect he wasnt going to negotiate with anybody he made you feel tough and right he didnt make you feel you were some kind of creep in a state of evolution brown also said for too long a time the power structure
has been sitting down talking with
martin_luther_king when they
should have been talking with malcolm
x
but he didnt always get this sort
of ovation in print by a nonwhite
abdul basit naeem headed one of
his articles for muhammad speaks
newspaper with this title selfpublicity
motivated malcolm not
devotion
negroes for the most part took
a sigh of relief upon the death of
elhajj malik elshabazz brother
malcolm why though he put
into words for them their misery
they could not understand nor
match his courage and they feared
white people in power and malcolm
knew this sad fact
the challenge of his courage
and loyal thrust toward truth as he
saw it filled blacks as well as whites
with fear and trembling
he also failed to reach the black
establishment for the same reason
he didnt reach the white middleclass
it seemed to them both that
he was talking about something
which had nothing to do with their
attachment to things
he was seen as a sort of warlord
he was as someone has said
an old testament avenger he
wanted to keep the horror of racism
before our eyes because we needed
to know it consciously
but by the time he became famous
the country saw him as it
always sees its scapegoats and he
knew it america saw the death
sign on his head and she saw him

too as part of her soul she herself
wasnt ever willing to face
not long before his death in a
debate with other civil_rights leaders
malcolm said if you find a
person without racism    usually j
theyre socialist or their political 
philosophy is socialism
was malcolm about to crash the 
white myth for the whites was he
about to crash it for the blacks and
show both the lie they live in their
white criteria which basely denies
all humanity
china in the future the end of o
the white myth is it very difficult
to understand why brother malcolm
could not be tolerated in the
west today
he once said that the worst
crime whites committed against
afroamericans was that the latter
i
had been taught to hate themselves
though he was officially given the
cold shoulder by most negro leaders
near the end of his life a few
men and women began to take notice
and to listen
but the black brother has come
all the way into the sacrifice and 
promise of his name and it is a
good thing
as we have seen in the past
however war can change the face
of the enemy change peoples
lives but today we know war can
also change the face of the earth
the only thing we are sure of is
that this is a time of challenge and
that malcolm had a very real part
in it
a white laivyer named despres

nically enough j it  it was just prior to i £ chicagos west side up j rising and martin_luther_kings assault on chicagos segregated neighborhoods that the agenda for a city council meeting included an ordinance to approve  public housing sites each of them in negro neighborhoods a lean professorial looking alderman spoke to the matter in view of the present condition of this ordinance it ought to be defeated it proposes four intolerable family highrise buildings which our experience has demonstrated to be harmful  it is bad city policy and bad civil_rights policy since public housing is nondiscriminatory it says that anyone who wants to live in public housing will have to live inside the segregated negro area and that no nondiscriminatory public housing will be allowed in the white ghetto outside the segregated negro area and what is proposed today is the counterpart of the policy we discussed at the last city council meeting when we considered the actions of high city officials who lead the government and public opinion and reside in buildings and belong to clubs which have rigid barriers against both negro and jewish americans    point of order mr president cried a short stocky alderman this is irrelevant and flagwaving it has nothing to do with the  sites we are considering the point of order is well taken spoke the chairman who happened to be chicago mayor richard j daley the first alderman appealed the order from the chair on the ground that it would be suppression of highly relevant discussion the chair was sustained with one dissenting vote perhaps the little drama will not seem unfamiliar to those acquainted with debates concerning the urban negro taking place throughout the nations large northern cities but chicagoans think their situation is unique the lean alderman who called passage of the ordinance a naked display of white power is leon m despres his antagonist who usually finds despres efforts on behalf of chicagos negro population irrelevant is alderman claude w holman despres is white holman is black but alderman holmanalong with five other negro aldermen is a member of the cook county democratic party better known as the daley machine and aiderman despres is an independent democrat not accountable to the mayor who also is the chairman of the cook county democratic central committee leon m despres was born in chicago in  and has lived in the  th wardthe ward he has represented since since he was a small boy the th ward consists of a large part of the integrated hyde park community and most of woodlawn home of one of the nations strongest community organizations the woodlawn organ ization a neighborhood where few but the merchants are white while political action chairman of the liberal ivi independent voters of illinois and engaged in private law practice despres was asked by fellow ivi members to run for alderman elected in  and reelected in  and in a bitterly contested battle in  his opposition to the daley machine in matters of racial policy has become more vehement over the years rather paralleling the mood of the total negro community when asked how he feels about being labeled rebel and maverick by chicago newspapers despres smiles slightly and says well i guess it means i do not accept a very undesirable status quo a motion resolution or amendment introduced before the city council by alderman despres is almost invariably the prologue to a ritual usually beginning with a repudiation by alderman holman and frequently joined by other administration aldermen whose remarks often approach the point of insult despres candidly states holman responds to me on assignment from daley and keane alderman thomas e keane is the administration floor leader and the epilogue to the ritual seldom changes despressponsored measures are usually tabled sent to committee or defeated outright to critics who contend that despres could accomplish more as a member of the regular democratic organization the machine rather than as its chief antagonist he replies i could certainly as an organization man be more effective in terms of patronage and favors but less effective in matters of policy his independency insists despres allows him the freedom to advocate his viewpoints administration aldermen cant talk or introduce anything without permission the outspoken alderman contends that he has more influence on the basic issue of integration because through bringing up issues i can compel the machine to take a position and he adds though they wont give me credit despres cites for example his having introduced early in  an amendment to the citys elevator code after four woodlawn children were killed as a result of mechanical failures of elevators the amendment which called for stronger elevator safety requirements was defeated however sometime later the administration on orders from mayor daley says despresintroduced an identical amendment which became law to the six negro administration aldermenoften called the silent sixpolitics means jobs status and money says despres he thinks that because they are negroes they cannot fail to understand the problem of segregation and oppression but the th ward alderman who was supported in his  campaign against a negro attorney by such prominent chicago negroes as earl b dickerson and truman k gibson sr as well as by the citys civil_rights leaders thinks that the six negroes are less responsive to the needs of the negro community because they are in the business of living off politics i am not exactly what is the business of living off politics the political machine dominates the negro vote says despres with its mercenary army of patronage jobs from which a man is fired at once if he fails to perform his political work for most of those holding the some  political jobs controlled by the machine the political work is precinct workdelivering the vote a former political appointee leahmon l reid now a newsman comments that it was not unusual for one who was reported to be not out ringing doorbellswhich was not a part of his official dutiesto be admonished youre not doing anything for the party according to despres in addition to delivering the vote political work might involve such things as control of the local naacp he also accuses the mercenary army of miscounting padding and buying elections despres thinks political organization is a necessity for civil_rightsminded groups but he contends that infiltrating the machine is impossible if you stay in the machine very long he says it in filtrates you the machine is completely autocratic says the aiderman the ward committeeman appoints everyone and can remove anyone he wants removed there are approximately  political patronage jobs available to each ward and the ward committeemen which include five of the six negro aldermen are directly accountable to chairman daley commenting on the widely publicized fact that mayor daley does not tolerate much dissension within his ranks despres maintains that any adulation of daley short of idolatry is considered treason but he facetiously adds daley is not a dictatorhes more like the president of a corporation    leon m despres affectionately called len by business associates and friends has consistently pleased civil_rights advocates with his positions he was one of the leaders in the effort to oust controversial school superintendent benjamin c willis described by despres as a man whose entire life has been devoted to hatred the  th ward reformist has attempted in vain to push through stronger legislation on open occupancy he has been a familiar figure in civil_rights marches in chicago as well as having made the journey to selma in the spring of  a strong despres resolution supporting the move to withhold  the seats of mississippi congressmen challenged by the mississippi freedom democratic party was defeated in favor of a weaker admin w tr istration motion  one of the more illustrious examples of the battling alderman in action was perhaps a seven hour  debate over james baldwins an  other country in which he led the opposition to the administrations attempt to ban the novel from a required reading list in a course at one of the citys public junior  colleges moreover the session provided insight into the peculiar u situation of the administrations negro councilmen despres especially eloquent in his defense of academic freedom and author james baldwin  equated chicagos tammany  with moscows kremlin for its censorship efforts and called the book banning venture an attempt to discredit baldwin because he is a negro writer the six negro aldermen sat silently throughout the session but during a recess one of them alderman robert h miller told a reporter the city council has no jurisdiction in this matter he further commented on the ridiculousness of the effort but when the time came to vote on a resolution requiring the board of education to remove the book from the required reading list alderman miller as did the other organization men voted to ban the novel the resolution however later proved futile  the session over baldwins novel pointed up the intellectual acumen which appears rather an anomaly in the citys legislative body of leon despres chicago reporter sam blair once noted that despres use of polysyllabic words during a council presentation while capturing the interest of high school observers left the other aldermen puzzled despres a man given to research can be seen taking notes during council sessions with a youthful zest that belies his  years both his demeanor and scholarship are in radical contrast to that of his chamber adversaries whose staidness would defy even the ancient roman courts the alderman does not reject the label intellectual but reminds one but that does not mean that i am without human warmth or compassion as a critic of mayor daley despres is invective he thinks the mayor would prefer that city council never meet and maintains that all the decisions are made in daleys inner councils laughingly he speaks of the administration aldermens desperation to make themselves heard often at the opening of a council meeting as many as  aldermen will read long speeches memorializing a deceased city figuretheyre real good at talking about dead men despres holds daley responsible for the perpetuation of both housing and school segregation he contends that daley while using the national democratic image and political patronage to hold the negro vote has catered to the segregationist vote by supporting the pattern of segregation    he thinks the mayor is threatened by the presence of martin_luther_king jr explaining that the white community will react against the mayor if he is unable to contain civil_rights activity such as marches in the white community white segregationists become angry at people who thwart their hatred says despres although the six negro aldermen have consistently praised the mayor as a champion of negro rights despres without hesitation states daley is at heart and by personal conduct a white segregationist more often than not despres opposes the mayors appointments from those to the school board and library board to the mayors choice for director of the citys commission on human relations the commission says despres acts as midwife to the growth of the ghetto and of its director ed marciniak one of daleys highly touted appointees everyone knew that he was chosen to do the kind of job the mayor wanted done essentially a political cover up the usually quickspeaking alderman answers a bit slower when asked about black_power which he finds an elusive term despres believes the integrationists can save the city if you know anything about the conditions in the united states you understand the notions of black_power ive never joined with those who denounce the muslimswhose headquarters are in my wardwhich doesnt mean that i join them but i understand them segregation says despres can destroy the city he thinks whites should not expect special gratitude or favors for speaking out on behalf of the negro and asserts that you cant fully end oppression until the oppressed have complete freedom to express themselves the alderman described by chicago novelist ronald fair as the only real negro in city government foresees the cracking of the daley machine the place to break the machine says despres is the democratic primaryas an independent in the june primary this year a significant breakthrough to that effect was made two independent negro candidates beat the democratic machine for the illinois state senatorial candidacy and both were expected to beat their republican opposition in november some of despres positions over the past two years have drawn strong criticism from some of the predominantly white hyde park community organizations as well as the university of chicago administration which is located in his ward does he expect that this factor along with the heightened cry for black political power will hinder him in next springs election ive lost a little section of white support he says without a trace of worry but ive gained enough negro and white votes to offset the loss no matter what side one takes on the racial issue it is pretty generally agreed in chicago that when an issue supported by civil_rights advocates comes before chicagos city council one man can be counted on to both speak and vote in its favor but it seems so natural after all leon m despres usually introduces such issues 
who speaks negro
by sarah webster fabio
 shapiro plays oneupsmanship with robert penn warren in the question he begs both in his negro digest article decolonization of american literature and in his introduction to harlem gallery while warren searches vainly but profitably by editing a book by the same name to learn who speaks for the negro shapiro asks a more loaded one who speaks negro his answer is the late melvin tolson his identification of tolsons language as being authentically negro is a gross inaccuracy which would mislead us into a familiar trap of liking someone for the wrong reason tolson was aware of the solons and sages asking what is a negro searching for his own identity from what he refers to as the ruins of his afroirishjewish grandpa and other racially mixed ancestors he asks who is a negro his answer that the negro is a dish in the white mans kitchena potpourri   given in harlem gallery is too simple a truth any notion of negritude which extols the virtue of being a rotten pot with flowers and petals for scent is lacking a full understanding of this concept melvin tolsons language is most certainly not negro to any significant degree the weight of that vast bizarre pseudoliterary diction is to be placed back into the american mainstream where it rightfully and wrongmindedly belongs allen tate recognized the distorted mirror image of the pseudo neoclassical angloamerican diction and i think rightfully interpreted this language as a device of parody much of the dialogue in harlem gallery suggests a satirization of the onedimensional and contradictory stereotypes of negroes whipped up in the kitchens of the white mans fantasy world although i must admit to some difficulty in trying to establish a pattern of tone which would serve as a signpost to the degree of sincerity the poet had for his subject in certain instances tolsons use of the grotesque overstatement excesses of diction at each end of the spectrum suggest that his language was very much a part of the parody language for tolson was a device which enabled him to make his statement about life as he observed it a statement which all but defies paraphrase the language of the negro is classical in the sense that it never gets too far from concrete realities from the thingy quality of objects persons places matter perceived in all its immediacy by the senses and not through oblique references and artificially created allusory illuminations negro if anything is a languagelargely unassimilated and unletteredwhich cuts through penetrates things as they are reflected in spirituals blues or jazz lyrics to a core of meaning eliciting a soulful response to a moment of realization of what it means to be a human being in a world with a stranglehold on this awareness such a language is truly poetic in its lyrical impulse and cannot be faked paul laurence dunbar phyllis wheatley bessie smith mahalia jackson ray charles willie mae thornton langston hughes and leroi jones can come to a lyric with a widely diverse body of diction and still i think speak negro karl shapiro is not expected to understand this it is very difficult although not impossible for a nonnegro to be able to assess this quality leroi jones mulls over this difficulty in the dutchman when clay says you dont know anything except whats there for you to see an act lies device not the pure heart the pumping black heart you dont ever know that karl shapiro in his decolonization of american literature decries the fact that american literature is a countrycousin literature of england he describes it as a three century old child yet clinging to the mothers apron strings an orphan in a far away place filled with sentimental longing for home new culture in every country except ours mr shapiro reminds us is based on home country settler and native in order for an american to become so attached to english literature it is necessary for him to lead an imaginary life shapiro feels and laments the fact that he suffers from this common addiction which amounts to cultural amnesia for a jew he expresses his concern in the statement that living an imaginary english life meant living a phony life of the mind for i was not english in any sense of the word he speaks of the three phases of decolonization in our culture and refers to them as nostalgia assimilation and negritude of these he comments nostalgia is homesickness not for the good old days but for the bad old days assimilation means a cultural entente at the expense of any mystique negritude means assertion of the realities historical and mystical as well the negro he feels is luckier than the jew because there he is unassimilable and unnostalgic the biggest fact of life in the modern world of language he says a language in itself is nothing a literature in itself is nothing a literature is the expression of a nations soul and a great literature  leaves nothing outthat is its greatness shapiro assisted untermeyer in editing the modern american and modern british poetry in  and by his own above definition of greatness the exclusion of claude mckay paul laurence dunbar james weldon johnson langston hughes melvin tolson and pulitzer prize winner gwendolyn brooks and all black poets writing in english fosters the status quo mediocrity which he deplores to say that the american artist who reaches back to the tradition is by his standards unauthentic is to place almost the total body of mainstream creativity into a bag the authenticity which he lauds would by its very nature be idiosyncratic and difficult and its significance stands very little chance of being recognized shapiro answers the question is negro literature possible by reminding us that given the context of his life in america only a pseudoliterature an uncle tom poem could be created by him and that it would be necessary for him as was the case of paul laurence dunbar to use a phony negro dialect as a medium because oxford english gave him no choice he then asks himself if there were to be an authentic negro medium where would it come from and timidly suggests the spiritual or blues as a likely source the difficulty inherent in shapiro launching a crusade to loosen the hold of the academic mind over poetry which refers back to prior commitments is apparent he must first free himself who would others free cultural amnesia is a historical reality of american negro existence a violent severance of past language customs and human relationships became a necessary prerequisite to the oppressed state that was to become his lot negro contraband culture traveled the long underground railroad of race poetry race music race folklore which is only recently surfacing switching to the main track a concept of negritude forged from historical realities and physical necessity and a races stubborn determination to be is the rich heritage of modern negro poets there are volumes of race poetry records of blues and spirituals to be rediscovered there is a growing body of world negro poetry to explore there is yet the too real daily confrontation of what it means to be negro there is still time to create myths from these realities in all their authenticity and it is a disservice to young negro poets to make them feel a necessity for an artificially created literary frame of reference it is sound advice that he gives when he says   it would be better to ignore the existence of the literature of reference and to create whatever we think valid than to go on tilting at windmills this is what the beat writers did they were successful because they refused to take part in the academic dialogue melvin tolson was not a beat poet he was a part of the neoclassical scene whoalthough as able as any to attempt the quixotic feat of reviving a dead horse albeit a trojan horsewas denied a rightful place in this theatre of the absurd like many negroes of this period he was told to go back and perfect the art and then in the great democratic tradition he would be accepted into the society of the neoclassicists he accepted and perfected the art of classical reference as a pillar for an american tradition in literature but became victimized by the cultural lag that is common between the white and negro worlds about this time allen tate the nashville agrarian poets and other champions of this movement gave up this vain pursuit of doing battle with tilting windmills therefore while tolson busied himself outpounding pound his fellow poets forgot to send him the message that pound was out negro poets who did not go out on that kind of a limb could watch the public literary spectacle of mainstream american menofletters and at the same time nurture their own contraband art the fact that negro literary history cannot be traced through mainstream anthologies makes a pointed statement about mainstream american literature and life and the racist nature of this life at the same time it says nothing about the tradition of a developing body of poetry by american and west indian negroes from the revolutionary period to the present negro anthologizers fortunately such as langston hughes and ama bontemps have aptly anthologized this development only a writer who overestimates the innocence of the negro reading public would attempt to sell them on an unseasonable image of the modern negro poet negroes are very hip consumers whether the commodity is clothing or poetry poets like clothes must appeal to the moment and reflect the spirit tempo tastes of the time there is a bold slim line in the mod look an unadorned sophistication outmoded are not only the colonial frock coats of the great white fathers but also the zoot suits the double breasteds even the traditional pin stripe oxford grey with the wide grotesque lapels negroes are tailoring their own fashions this season the new garments promise to be better fits than any of the traditional secondhand outfits which were pawned off as models which suited their fancy who speaks negro any black man who is on top of whats happening

down town last week always awanting to fight someone he going to get dead someday suddenlike no count raskil like his paw and she knew what he meant sitting there as calm as a rock and puffing his chalk pipe with his hands hanging dead over his crossed legs hes going to dead sudden and hed stare across the barbecue into the night yes said her mother those who live by the sword powerful true is the word of god said her father one cannot gather figs in thistles you could hear the toads calling into the night you could see the peeniewallie fireflies aboutand night was made for love and desire and for a girl to choose her man the father of her children if the night breeze touched her cheek it was the fingers of her unknown mate and with it was the smell of the landof life as yet unborn in december the lignum vitae trees had blossomed and it was like a lady in blue now in may it blossomed again but the rains were comingafter the draughtand the pale blue blossoms were beaten to the ground and it was a time of decisionfor planting and she was reminded of the beauty of a woman here today and tomorrow     she was reminded of the choice of a girljoy tonight and tomorrow ?  p in december big joe had been making passes at her coming up to see you gal not unless you want to dead sudden strong man never wrong who is going to stop me you heard about my paw who is afraid of tata higgins him and his old gun if you not scared what stopping you i am taking my time gal and no need none of them boy in the district set eye on you you belong to me i am going to come a courtin death she had said and flounced off and day after day if he met her he was after her big joe had a way with womenbold and brassy the other men she knew were too quiet especially fred hed just sit there and look at her and hed have no words to say and somehow she had narrowed it down to one of these two and out of sheer perversity perhaps big joe would win because the other one was afraid to move nice boy that there fred her father would say quiet like and she knew he was feeling his waytelling her what he wanted her to do you may have sons but there is something about a daughter she knew especially a daughter that is an only child especially a tall lissome wellshaped girl growing up in your housegrowing so fast like a field of cornyesterday a tiny plant peeping above the ground and tomorrow a golden field ready for the reaper and you are afraid who the reaper will be you try to hint to her knowing so much of life but even a father is afraid of his own girlchild for if she gets it into her head that you are forcing her into something she will be like the worst of mules she will be like a mule that will kick and bite when you are tightening a girth and she will be no use to anyone you have to break her gently like a mulefirst a bag then a saddle leading her around with a light load and remember to keep her neither in the center of the road nor too far into the bank side as she was broken so would she be she knew it herself and she knew why her father was hinting there is a lot of time everything comes to him who waits all one wants is patience patience when you are young patience to reach fruition patience when the night calls it is like the parched land waiting for the rain it is like the parched grass waiting    waiting    and everything is in embryo in february when she had looked across the low foothills to the seastanding high on the barbecue with the wind pressing her print dress around hershe had looked across the everdescending and undulating bottom lands to the savannahs and far away in the distance she had seen the white virginal blur of the great catchment to a tank awaiting rain and she had rebelled against the lot of woman to wait and wait perhaps forever and forever was the eternal hills the eternal sea blue far distant and dispassionate waiting for time and god know what waiting through the eternities of man and that had been february february of the parched earth and no one dared to plant day after day the sun had rolled like a molten ball across the skies day after day her father and the other men had looked at the skies and prayed for rain and day after day there had been no rain the parson when he preached spoke of rain he prayed for kindly showers and the people understood that their rainmaker was interceding with god and when they came out they looked for a miracle from the iron skies they knew it would come it must come but when and a girl seeking in her heart asked herself other questions of life someday i shall live but when but men seek water the earth and the green things thereof may apparently wither and die but man and the animals are mobile so they seek water and find it man must have love too he seeks it and then suddenlyout of a clear skyit is all around easter sunday is always a day to remember all the women are in  white white the symbol of purity and of the contrite heart white as the slain lamb and here is the familiar spirit of god the only thing the common man over the world may have and the people are filled with the awe of it that a man should die for themeven for them the black people but what is color black people are like all other people they have the good points and faults of all other people but above all people they have had and still have the burden of great suffering out of this has come a great spiritual capacity but this is of the spirit what of the flesh the black people are strong black women are beautiful you can ask big joe here in church or fred there is no other woman for constancythere is no other race of women of such controlled desire and satisfying approach and even in church liza ann knew her father was looking at her and praying to god to give her what it was beyond his power to give her peace and happiness and the love of a good man for she was beautiful you can ask big joe and fred the parson will tell you that the song of solomon is analagous to the church big joe and fred will tell you it is a love song to a black woman it is liza ann sitting in church on easter sunday it is the lovely black column of her neck it is the smooth ebony of her flawless skin like unto velvet you can ask big joe and fred why should big joe go to church and keep away from drink why should fred go to church for a man who died for you do men die in times of peace for strangers do they die for men they do not know when in this age there is only selfishness and greed a black man shall go to church to look at a lovely black young girl and through love of her try to find the beauty that there is in life to find faithfor women believe how else can they live and they cannot live unless they love and love is trust but what shall a young girl believe the song of solomon is an analogy to the church look out over the parched commons to the earth look out over the faces of the black sheep feel the wind on your cheeks and listen to its whisper in the pimento trees and see the sun oh lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world have mercy upon us ? after the service liza ann had come out into the sun and her father and her mother had had her right along with them and everyone was saying howdy tata higgins howdy miss rosa howdy liza ann and the old black men had chucked her under her chin with their calloused fingers and said to her father tata where dis gal ah grow good looking to go and her father had been proud and they had said to her mother she take after you miss rosa her mother had chuckled and said in embarrassed pride go on with you maas joe and you maas alec and the old men had chucked her under the chin some more and the young men had dreamed dreams they had said howdy liza ann howdy liza ann and the rest had been in their eyessome tomorrow youll be mine and all the while she knew her father was watching themherself and the young men he would shoot stone dead the man who advantaged her he was a godfearing man but for his family he would fight in church and she had been thinking which of you all i cannot make up my mind which of you all if you want me come and get me take me make up my mind for me and she had laughed to herself come and take me haha not with pa around haha stretch out your hand and take me my god pa would have a fit and the thought of it had made her eyes crinkle with hidden laughter and the young men and the old men had smiled themselves and an old man had said whac a happy gal and now her father had spoken and every one had listened men and women it must rain please god if not we will starve i never sees a drought like this in all my bom days last week i been down to savannah and dem is already practically starvin the sins of mankind is heavy upon the earth and the hand of god has fallen upon us and the old men had shaken their heads never a drought like this they had puffed at their chalk pipes and had been lost in thought the women too had held the silence pregnant with hope she had smelled the land in the tobaccofilled air she had heard the land in their voices she had seen the red earth in their dark bodies her country her people herself waiting for rain in may the rain had come suddenly when the tamarind tree in the common opposite their house had appeared almost deadwhen her father had decided to sell his stockthe rain came suddenly in the night it had come first as a hesitant patter and then it had become a steady tattoo borne on a gust of wind hastening to the earth she had known then how the earth must feel and the dark faces of her father and her mother had turned to each other in the lamplight  in the morning the world had appeared new she had come out to the barbecue and gone to the tank to see how much water had gone into it but first before she did that she had turned her eyes across the savannahs to the sea had turned her face into the wind and then towards the stone wall now wet on which a bird had been singing her father had come out filled with renewed life as if the rain had poured it into him and over his coffee in the kitchen he had announced that he would have a digging match the next week wednesday he had said going to plant out the three acres cross the common and the only way to do it and ketch the rain is to have a diggin match ill tell them man on sunday and you woman must look after the food ill get two bottles of rum now we got the rain we must keep moving he had been full of plans and he had spent the day in the buttery looking over his tools and mending a pack saddle her mother had said nothing after breakfast she had tied up her skirt in the billowing hoop around her waist called a pokopanya and had taken a hoe and gone out to the land behind the kitchen and began to plant corn you could see her digging a hole in the ground and then dropping the corn in it from a pocket in her apron and then molding up the hole with a bare foot the earth was receiving its own to give it forth again manyfold and liza annwhat had she been doing she was still waiting and it was as if her father had known her dissatisfaction once passing her he had taken his pipe from his mouth and spoken as usual apparently to no one everything comes in gods own time it is strange how time appears to fly when one looks back at it you spend all the days in expectation of an event and it seems a lifetime away and then after it has come and gone you discover that it had come too quickly wednesday morning had been upon them before they knew it they had hardly set a light to the large blocks of dried pimento wood that formed the fires beside the stone wall and put on the kerosene tins of chocolate and water to draw the coffee before the men had begun to arrive singing and shouting all the women who were helping with the food had been there already and now came the men singing bring me half a hoe come gi me yah    bring me half a hoe   and she had heard big joe roaring above the rest with a hoe over his shoulder bring me half a hoe     and where had fred been he had been standing inconspicuously in the crowd and he had not been singing you never knew how these digging matches giving free labor to ones neighbor ever got under way one moment they are drinking large steaming mugs of chocolate and coffee and then they are off a great line of men is surging across the field they are digging potato hills in one mad frenzied struggle right across the field the hoes are rising and falling with all the strength of the wielder you never knew that men could work so hard and out in front had been the singing mansinging and dancing and controlling the match singing fast songs to get the tempo of the race making up his own words galoh galho they had gone across the field like mad leaving a straight line of potato hills behind them and now they were coming back and the pace had begun to tell twice more they had to cross the field they had begun to string out panting sweating straining every muscle and out in front had been big joe and behindit had seemed impossiblefred the spectators had been shouting and the men had been coming along with a desperate hurry big joe had never been beaten in any match for a year now and yet here was a challenger to the champion of the district to the people it had been only thatthe champion digger and a challenger to her it had been more than that the battle was for her it had been as if at the end she would be the prize and that was what she knew they hoped to getthe prize of her esteem the pace had told the same two had gone far out in front and big  joe had become desperate he had hurried his strokes and put too much into the down swing of his hoe and fred had come up abreast then the race begun in deadly earnest one man it seemed had to collapse hill after hill they had come down the line and the old people had come to stand on the finishing line hill after hill they had been coming and then imperceptively fred had come ahead and strangely she had been glad a hill ahead could he hold it her father had spoken the greatest diggin match i have ever seen in the district and old custos the oldest man in the district had said only once afore i ever see a match like this and the winner dropped dead  fear had seized her heart they had come on and on then there was a great cheer for the new champion they had been panting as at the end of a long running race they had only been able to lean on their hoes while the sweat had run down their dirtbegrimed faces and then it had happened someone had laughed at big joe and in moving he had bounced against her and she had drawn away and big joe humiliated before her eyes had said who the raas you drawin away from since when you become so damn stocious fred had dropped his hoe and hit him so hard that big joe had rolled on the ground then big joe was up roaring hell yah today  she had stood petrified and her father had rushed big joe and big joe had hit her father knocking him down and her father had rushed for his gun the men held big joe and fred and over it all she had heard her mother shouting jesus christ tek him away before tata come out with him gun jesusah dont want tata hang for murder and then there had been a roar from the house and there was her father rushing out and bringing the gun to his shoulder jesus christ maas tata maas tata everyone except her mother fred and herself had run desperately for the stone wallbig joe well up in front and she not knowing what she did had taken fred by the handand suddenly the gun had spoken lawd jesus     everyone had fallen flat on their faces and big joe had crawled behind the stone wall everyone had been screaming maa tata     maa tata     and her father had stood there and said that one was in the air to get you people out of the way i am just waiting for that sonofabitch to show his head and everyone had trembled flat on their black faces on the red earth tata higgins was known for his gun he was the greatest gunman in miles and he never missed not a target the size of big joe and everyone had moaned it was a saddening sound going across the field to behind the stone wall where big joe was hidden it was the end of time and no one moved for fear of tata higgins turning his gun on them instead and all the while she had been holding freds hand and he had put his arm around her and neither of them had realized that they were doing this even her mother just stood there waiting everyone waited for big joe to break from cover but big joe had lain behind the wall at last her dadstrangelylaughed and lowered his gun it had been as great a shockhis laughas the warning shot he had shouted everybody get up ahm not shooting anyone tell that big joe boy to get off my place and to stay off and when he came up to them fred and herselfand said drop in at the house anytime son and then she knew it was as simple as that

hat westerners think w of the african society today is expressed in two radically different ways the one is an apology for the african situation the other is a sharp condemnation directed towards some stagnant elements in african society and the many misadventures used by africans to remove them but none of these evaluations has been successful in producing any positive effect than can achieve the goal of creating a better flourishing society because the two of them have not as yet been received in good faith by africans this situation can only be redeemed by creating a meaningful dialogue between africa and the west africans cannot allow themselves to be deceived when westerners tell them that they have been right all the while and that the negative judgment they rendered against them was due to ignorance the fact that the african society is relatively stagnant shows that something is fundamentally wrong which must be discovered and excised for the sake of progress a professor of mine used a quotation from andre gide at the beginning of a book he wrote about the kpelle people which is this the less intelligent the white man is the more he feels that the african is stupid but it is not lack of intelligence that is mostly responsible for the condemnation in many cases evaluation of the african society has been conducted by wellmeaning specialists in anthropology history politics and religion if their efforts fail to get at the heart of the matter is is because they have been restricted to the material culture of the continent and have not entered into a real dialogue with the people any man given all the practical evidences of the situation will have to be negative in his judgment of them lets face it the people are poor plagued by superstitions incompetent leadership disease ignorance etc progress however cannot come about by telling them to transform the entire continent for it to develop after the pattern of western society those who advocate this point of departure would say all that is needed is time time will bring about the necessary change western culture which cost westerners hundreds of years to produce cannot be imposed upon these people in an arbitrary way if it will be useful and beneficial to them but time itself is only an historical phenomenon if it is not rightfully used there is no guarantee that progress will come about by itself the reason for progress in the west is not to be found in time but essentially in the western spiritthe restless search for something better the comparative dissatisfaction with what is already possessed if the individual is convinced that what he is doing or what he already has is good enough he will never see any reason for seeking something better he will always hold fast to it if time is not used as the condition for change it is education which is advocated but again education by itself does not bring about change of course i believe what bertrand russell saidthat the man who is in a house which is on fire will be in a better position to save himself if he knows how to get out than another man in the same situation who does not know how to get out but it is still true that a man in a burning house may know how to get out and refuse to save himself many of those who are violently opposed to improvement and progress in africa are educated africans they are the ones who become excessively defensive of the african culture and take suit with the westerners who are apologizing for it it is not uncommon to see a university graduate reverting to superstition as a valid way of coping with mental problems in africa in witch doctors and psychiatry judith randal writing for harpers magazine defends the psychiatric practice of dr lambo a nigerian psychiatrist using witchcraft to treat mental patients as a scheme that makes sense her argument is that this method of treating mental patients is good for this special society but the question is not whether dr lambos psychiatric practices discharge rate compares favorably with that of the best western mental hospitals or not but is it a realistic solution of the problem it is easy to make a sacrifice in order to eradicate the fear of lightning which is prevalent among natives of west africa but one must be prepared to make another sacrifice when the fear of lightning is replaced by the fear of spirits or darkness or rain even though a wholesale importation of psychiatric practices from the west may not solve the problem it doesnt mean a sentimental reversion to the ancient practice of witchcraft will do i think this reversion of the african to his old archaic formulas for the solution of social problems is done much more out of protest rather than realism the african must make a truce with the historical reality in which he finds himself the european has come and ruled him and in this ruling the african has suffered the loss of his own value systemhas been encouraged to follow western standards which in some crucial cases may not apply to his own circumstances but this does not justify the african culture as such improvement is needed to make  this improvement the african must search deeply in his own spirit in his own problems to know where improvement is needed there is no easy answer to this problem what judith randal regards as making sense is not to be misunderstood however most westerners who support the africans retention of his own culture have good intention they tell us of the dangers africans must reckon with in modern civilization the problems of migraines neuroses and the complicated nature of modern life which entails nervousness they are exceedingly impressed by what they consider as the innocence of the noble savage the peaceful village life the absence of crime in the clanvirtues which are all radically destroyed wherever modern civilization takes sway but mankind must learn to appreciate the fact that life at all levels is never lacking in danger perhaps outwardly we may be impressed by the innocence and peace of the village life but it is threatened by disaster as much as modern urban life the villager is subject to the assault of wild animals diseases low rate of production in farming thus famine superstition and fear etc he like his modern counterpart for whom life has become extremely complicated is not safe what he needs is the knowledge to cope successfully with the demands of development the modern westerner may be suffering from the complication of modern civilization because perhaps he had no civilization more advanced to learn from its mistakes but the african has the advantage to recognize in the western world the problems that go with developed civilizationand to help him is to train him to handle these problems to live in his socalled innocent and peaceful village is in fact more dangerous and unnecessary for he would be subject to problems that could be solved by modern technology and so we come to the conclusion that things as they are in africa are not progressive and satisfactory the fundamental mistake which africans and westerners have been making in trying to bring about progress is the advocation of one of two extremes that cannot work  the first extreme position is as indicated the acceptance of things as they are with the opinion that they are good and meaningful and must not be disturbed by bringing in modern civilization itie second extreme position is the advocating of a wholesale importation of western civilization far more insight into these positions i would like to deal with two typical books written by two westerners in trying to justify them the first book is called new song in a strange land written by esther warner the problem with this book is that it is superficial like the books of laurens van der post it praises the african life without compromise what esther warner is telling us in effect is that the africans in fact have something to teach westerners their civilization or way of life is good and honorable and all the westerner must do to discover this is to become an anthropologist she is duly impressed by the innocence and wisdom of africans and every statement they make concerning certain facts of life is invested with rich meanings but i think all the implications or meanings she derives from the africans are more or less what she brings into their thoughts rather than what their thoughts contain with her sophisticated western education it is easy for her to take seriously something that africans may say in error or ignorance or jest this is primarily due to the fact that the africans she dealt with were not essentially educated she dealt with ordinary native men who worked around her house and she did not really know their languages when an african man tells her that a missy cant know he is apparently expressing his inability to communicate his knowledge to her he is not implying the fact that he has some insight into reality which a westerner is unable to understand esther warner of course is aware of the desperate pathetic nature of the african life she took a trip into lomaland to see superstition at work and the unnecessary tremendous toll of life it took she recollected this in another book called seven days in lomaland and so we might then ask why in new song in a strange land she attempted to defend such a life her defense might have been invoked by the fact that she discovered the immensity of the problem with which the africans must wrestle the extent of the difficulties does not permit any optimistic hope of finding a possible immediate solution but to find a means of solution is to have an adequate knowledge of the problems which unfortunately she lacked in another book the silkcotton wood tree she tried to describe the problems as intimately as she could and her apparent failure at an honest evaluation was still due to a lack of insight into them for instance she had a girl explaining to a boy the secrets of the womens society the fact that this is an unforgivable sin to commit is balanced by her immodest narration of it in every conceivable way she proved to be totally strange in the land and thereby the problems of the land remained strange to her in a book of fiction like the silkcotton wood tree the protagonist should have been a westerner i think a westerner who wants to evaluate the problems of africa through fiction must use as his protagonist one of his kind whom he understands writers like w somerset maugham and graham greene have been successful in writing about foreign places because they chiefly used this device this is still looking at things with the eyes of a westerner but at least the danger of misrepresentation will be minimal we will know exactly that the evaluation of the problems shows the westerners point of view which is important for africans to know what you take yourself to be must be balanced by what somebody else takes you to be out of the medley of such observations you will come closer to what you really are left to your own devices and judgments you may believe that you are very important or very unimportantor glorify or condemn certain aspects of your personality which someone from the outside could view objectively and judge fairly africans welcome criticisms from the outside although they must yet realize the importance of criticisms from the inside they would readily accept the criticism of someone from the west and bar their own people from criticizing them it is a dangerous thing to live by the opinions of others to the exclusion of your own from the experiment of esther warneran experiment which most westerners are urgingwe realize that a sentimental attempt to preserve the african culture as it is is impractical but the alternative of changing it radically as urged by jens larsen cannot be the rule anyone who accepts reality as it is and not as he wants it to be will find in jens larsens  tom toms a classical and dramatic presentation of the african situation jens larsen presents as his main character kwoli a traditional kpelle wan who in a way peculiar to himself and in the world in which he lives returns home upcountry from a socalled civilized community in sierra leone in kwoli we are made to see a frantic attempt to redeem a lost humanity in an acceptable social term namely western civilization he clearly has a rational motivation even if it should be rooted in a vague apocalypse which he believes will be and can be realized given the necessary attention and effort indeed kwolis aim is genuine and great he sees the effectiveness of western civilization and hopes to use it to redeem his homeland from superstitions for progress while he opposes superstitionsor what he considers to be superstitions he is forced to be resilient to their pressure perhaps until the right moment when he can successfully eradicate them he goes into the bush school mens secret society to become an initiate of itthereby becoming a fullfledged member of the tribe kwoli then is caught between two social realities african and western it is hard to understand if his acquiescence to the african tradition will necessarily lead to the establishment of western civilization but the most important thing is not to know how kwoli will resolve this difficulty but to know the propriety or need of changing the social structure as a whole one does not need to go very far in reasoning to realize that this attempt to change radically the african society is a selfdefeating attitude for one thing kwoli holds the traditional culture in contempt and in his imagination it is a necessary evil which must be eliminated perhaps if kwoli had approached the situation with a disinterested attitude of mind to find out the main problems to solve them we could hope that he would be successful in redeeming the society the life of any people no matter how primitive or advanced it is has some positive and negative aspects where the negative aspects exceed the positive as in this case the tendency is to dismiss it as unrealisticand evil people everywhere have their own sense of values or concept of reality which can only be modified and enhanced but not destroyed to destroy it is to destroy the people and if kwoli is chiefly concerned about performing works of destruction we cannot see how he will ever redeem the people the predicament in which kwoli finds himself is due to the fact that he is not really educated in western civilization to the uneducated manas he isthe modem civilization may appear very attractive an adoption of it is more important  than using it to solve problems jens larsen maintained a very significant logic in the development of the story when he showed that kwoli needed more education he had been serving as a porter for  bradley a surveyor who had heard about a missionary in the area and advised kwoli to go to him for more education i should like to keep you but for your own good ill turn you over to the missionary when he comes i know he will be  glad to employ you as a helper and give you private lessons    he must take the long and hard road of learning this new tradition before passing it to others with more than a superficial understanding of this tradition he shall most probably discover a way of using it for the  benefit of his people and not their destruction after breaking this illusion in kwolis life in the first part of the book jens larsen indefensibly falls in the same trap he tried to avoid instead of trying to show kwoli getting enough education to come and use it for the development of his society he repeats the same message which he gave us before in the first part of the book the need for  change in fact the message becomes much more eloquent and vehement the missionary langdon i out of his frustration and disap pointments writes a long letter to the home church in justifying his lack of satisfactory statistical records of converts which alone would convince them that every dollar they contribute to the work is bringing satisfactory results as if spent elsewhere i think it is very unfair to compare mission work in africa with mission work elsewhere in the world in the asiatic mission  fields for example missionaries have for the most part been able to build upon a foundation of culture developed through centuries just as st paul did in greece and rome at the beginning of the christian era but in africa in general and in liberia in particular it is entirely different here in the interior of liberia the negro is still living in his state of primitiveness our task then is not only to introduce christianity but also to create a culture to serve as a foundation for it and this takes a long long time    perhaps what jens larsen did not realize was the fact that everybody in the world is already cultured you cannot create a new culture anywhere the problem is to accept what is already present and modify it or improve upon it another thing he did not realize was the fact that the transmission of christianity cannot be identified with the transmission of culture in the asiatic mission fields where culture is present missionaries are getting as much difficulty in christianizing the people as in africa in fact the presence of a formal culture may be a tremendous hindrance to the advancement of christianity more than anything else st paul failed to convert the philosophers in athens the day must yet come for a buddhist to leave his religion for christianity but it is not only at this point that we see a serious flaw in the book all of a sudden we see kopu appear in it kopu really eugenie is supposed to be the daughter of a professor of howard university she was kidnapped when she was a little child while her parents traveled with her through the liberian jungle she lived and grew up in this jungle the incidents centering around kopu are real and true but she is caught in them in innocence children who were kidnapped by the leopard society when it existed in liberia must definitely be related to the kidnappers it was rareto some extent unimaginable that a stranger a white person at that could become a part of a tribal mystery rather than a tribal warfare her presence is nothing less than an attempt to reinforce a strong advocation of western culture for africa in a much more serious way it is a judgment against the african culture as a whole and its need for complete change    perhaps we should stop exploring the book at this point the problem as i see it that the  africans must struggle with is the attempt to discover what they really want and to work realistically towards it they have to evaluate the african situation as they are experiencing it and work towards improvement it is an african problem if the westerner does not sympathize with africa he will condemn africa if the african man does not approve western civilization he will accept it in a most radical way all of these attitudes are simply evading the real issue the africans need to find out what he really wants and to work towards achieving it without adopting any easy formula there are africans who are trying to compromise or reconcile western civilization with the african civilization this also is unrealistic while some features of western civilization may be useful in africa there are many other features of it that are unsuitable to the african situation and so there is no way of playing safe at this point the african must find out what he needsand if he should escape this fundamental necessity there will never be an improved advanced africa the african countries will always be in the developing stage and what africans will have to reckon with perpetually will be the two cultures african and westernand they must use them as means to the end of developing an appropriate african society it is not a matter of choosing between the two or trying to reconcile them

by nikki giovanni
hat problems occupy me personally well im worried about a manchilda manchild who will inherit this a black manchild in the quest for his lost manhood does he know what hes looking for will i have to become a white woman before he can claim it sometimes it seems thats what im supposed to be now that he is on the move im castigated for being a black womana strong black woman who has fed and clothed him and his children since he has decided the time is now must i play the silent innocuous thing who suddenly doesnt have the strength to open a jar of pickles let alone organize a block club for fear of castrating him is it necessary that i cease being a black woman so that he can be a man is it fair it seems to me that we are involved in several protest movements none of which should be based on innateness his sex has given him no innate right to rule im worried about a manchild who says hes making a revolution with the nonwhite peoples of the world if hes making revolution its with the colored people the world is colored and noncolored not white and nonwhite thirteen per cent of the world has no right to decide how the other  per cent will refer to itself and if my manchild allows that minority to decide he is not making revolution hes not even off the plantation im worried about a manchild who says the colored people on relief unemployed or unemployable are not worth trying to get to because they are illiterate and dont understand the revolution i wonder why now that he is hip to the i was going to use a bad word but decided to play the lady bit coming down he isnt more patient with his unenlightened brothers hell spend all day talking to a liberal but doesnt have five minutes for the man nobody has time for i wonder when well quit playing bull fight you know the bull gets out there and tries to kill the cape dont be like that bullgo for the man jews get used too im worried about a manchild who says he wont fight until all other afroamericans are ready to fight that attitude is the reason we have a protest movement instead of a revolution and im especially worried about my lover in vietnam who thinks he should be killing somebody elses manchild but every time stokely carmichael opens his mouth every time leroi jones picks up his pen every time i see a malcolm_x button or a think black bumper sticker i know we are on the road to revolution we used to think we could hitchhike our way down freedom road but what they did was to put us on protest highway while they took the white supremacy express well we put a panther in our tank and robert williams at the wheel and turned the car toward mecca the most important step we have made toward revolution is the step away from the west but we have only made steps ram is a step goal is a step the muslims are a step and we must recognize them as such all we are doing now is getting ready to revolt we are on the road and roads have ends at the end of this road will be the revolution not the completed change but the painful beginning at the end of this road we will have decided that policemen should not carry guns we will revolt to see to it that they dont at the end of this road we will have decided that the only property man is entitled to is the house he lives in we must revolt to our own neighborhoods we will have decided that everyone should have a guaranteed annual wage and adequate medical care regardless of age that the state should pay people to travel to learn languages to attend college and graduate school before it starts we will know that there is room on this earth for any number of different peoples and that we do not have to annihilate any group before we can be free take power from themyes but to speak of wiping them out thats such a white solution and i am not picturing any revolution that will not begin for another  years i fully expect to be free and to taste the fruits of the power tree that has been de  nied me it will take blood some of theirs this time and it will take daring but we will do it

ow that the impassioned fervor of identifying with blackness for the sake of blackness has become so familiar one feels a need to assess the meaning and value of negritude could it be a sour grapes device sophisticated flippancy or merely whistling in the dark pun intended this was the great themequestion of the first world festival of negro arts held in dakar senegal april   officially or unofficially the word negritude was on everyones lips for many it was an old word for others it was quite new but for negro americans it was the latest variation of soul who needed to define soul though you either had it or you did not have it inexplicable or not soul is a tenuous intangible esprit de corps as it were as old as slavery itself the american descendants of africans knew from the earliest days of servitude that their sins would find them out and their sin was in their skin it was so easy to identify a runaway slave that eventually a curse became a blessing the slaves had to stick together to comfort each other to try to establish a workable morale they learned this lesson well and handed it down from generation to generation in spirituals through prayers and in unspoken empathy were all in this damned leaky boat together are we going to sink or swim and gradually there came into existence various techniques for survival the most significant one germinating in the minds of the dark brother mere selfassertion was not enough there was a need for prideinnegroness dont be ashamed of being a negro later grew into bolder doctrines of race pride it became necessary to move beyond the negative concept of raceconsciousness so as to say quite positively that there are values to be derived from being negro hence a therapeutic creation of soul the seeds had been sown as early as the eighteenth century when negro poets orators and writers such as phillis wheatley torn from her native senegal at age seven or so george moses horton and frederick douglass centered their thoughts around the virtues of freedom and liberty for all in america the more militant marcus garvey born in  established the back to africa movement the gifted paul laurence dunbar  became the uncrowned poet laureate of negro america his poignant little brown baby wif spaklin eyes allowed negroes to look at themselves without shame the nordic standard of beauty became irrelevant this attitude became more crystalized by the erudite w e b du bois who wrote souls of black folk in  however it was not until after world war i that many people began to reevaluate old established patterns of thought during the late s there emerged in uptown new york city a genuine cult of negroness called the negro renaissance by many it focused attention sharply on the fact that the negros views of himself were diametrically opposed to the white mans views of the negro generalization though this may be in essence it is true harlem then became the heart of negro americahomea place where a negro could be comfortable being a negro a group of brilliant young negro artists primarily writers started publishing beautiful proud soul messages to themselves and to all other negroes handsome globetrotting young langston hughes dared to make the world accept the blues the humor the everydayness of the negro he and other writers such as james weldon johnson countee cullen rudolph fisher waring cuney claude mckay and sterling brown infused into the hearts and minds of young black people long before world war iithe idea that the negro had a talent a gift a meaning quite simply they called it soul it was not difficult for a negro to catch the message it was sent in many ways through a song a book a sermon a jam session or through a downhome meal the message further said weve got something the white man doesnt have and the white man in his ambivalent suntanning haircurling nightclub singing way wants it too this soul thousands of miles away from harlem in the african country of senegal a sensitive young intellectual leopold sedar senghor later educated in france used his poetry to express great pride in black africa he called it negritude president senghor of senegal gave the opening address of the first world festival of negro arts at the colloquium on negro art in the life of the people dakar senegal he set forth the function of the festival by spelling out the function of negro art in the life of the black man he explained saving us from despair this negro art sustains us in our effort toward economic and social development in our determination to live two other events of the festival may help to illuminate the aspect of negritude the first occurred on easter saturday in a very inventive production of the passion play called the dark disciples blues version of the st luke passion though the story was old the interpretation was new this time the actors were black jesus mary pontius pilate the disciples it was only when judas came forth to kiss jesus that one saw a white face this was negritude in a moment of exquisite subtlety the other event was a moment of history called goree though the festival offered authentic dance troupes by the dozen poetry recitals drama cinema and fantastic art in resplendent array one encountered a sense of destiny a confrontation with ones past when he embarked for the island of goree only a short distance from dakar small easily fortified goree provided a natural quarantine of such strategic importance that it became the most important slave market in africa no visitor could be properly prepared for the actual sight of the slave dungeons yet there they weremute testimony to unspeakable cruelty horrors and torture a monument to mans inhumanity to man one saw with great anguish the narrow low slits of ratinfested cells into which had been crushed and jammed endless numbers of captured africans the only egress was the rockbound coast of the atlantic ocean goree the aching womb of africa had spawned and then had spewed out one of the great evils of the modern world yet selfinduced pride in the survival of the fittest or an inoculation of the soul against adversity was bom there and though it is caustic and bitter to be a thing apart it is good therapy to use the hurts the threats the insults sweet are the uses of adversity negroes in order to survive have had to use their adversities as a means of becoming stronger than more flexible than and often more understanding than their oppressors one fine day when all sick people become well it will no long  er be necessary to communicate the message of negritude because everyone in the land of the free will have learned the language of the soul
