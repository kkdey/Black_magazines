discrimination has struck at the heart of the American J YTI L dreampromise of freedom and equality of opportunity  TnC £ for over  years It has gnawed at the political and vS g social fabric of America at times threatening to over c whelm us It has exacted high costsin human suffering economic loss a loss that approached  billion in  inferior education blighted neighborhoods and infant mortality to mention only a few Racial discrimination has been a serious handicap to our foreign policy especially in our relations with the peoples of the developing nations of Asia Africa and Latin America As the Republican candidate for the United States Senate I advocate a broadlybased massive assault against all remaining forms of discrimination in American life I call for an Open Societya society which extends to all Americans the freedom and opportunity to have equal justice under law to obtain quality education to enjoy decent housing and good health and to gain equal access to the economic benefits available in a free enterprise system In order to achieve an Open Society the thinking and approach to the problem of civil_rights must be redirected There must be a major shift in emphasis in current programs I suggest three guidelines A Coordinated Comprehensive Strategic Attack The problems of racial discrimination are interrelated They occur in discernible patterns Patterns of segregation in housing are reflected in de facto segregation in schools Substandard education is correlated with high rates of unemployment Limitations on employment and the opportunity for vocational advancement in turn restrict income and economic mobility Discrimination is a system that will yield only to a coordinated comprehensive strategic attack In recent years other than civil_rights groups the Federal Government has borne the brunt of this attack But state and local governments and the private sector of our nation our universities churches our labor unions businesses and civic associationsmust be allies An excellent example has been Massachusetts which has actually moved in a direction that is well in advance of the Federal Government If this nation is to deal with more than the individual symptoms a constructive partnership will be needed between the public and the private sectors at all levels  Metropolitan Planning The problem of discrimination against the Negro is no longer a regional problem The experiences of depression war and population migration have made it a problem of national scope increasingly focused in our metropolitan centers of population Negroes who have moved to the nations cities have been excluded by economic and racial barriers from the predominantly white residential suburbs The growing ghettos of our central cities with their deteriorating housing inferior schools and generally inadequate public facilities now stand as the greatest challenge to the achievement of an Open Society If the nation is to resolve the problems stemming from racial concentration in our cities it will need metropolitanwide planning It cannot be bound by local prejudice or by the inertia of poorly conceived governmental programs Too many Federal programs stop with the central city when the basic problems of discrimination are much wider Here must be a willingness to experiment with enlarged governmental districts intergovernmental compacts new site locations for housing schools and other public facilities and programs that link two or more communities in the metropolitan area In substance a new metropolitan perspective must be applied to virtually all facets of discrimination in our urban society Without such planning the problems of the ghetto will become insurmountable  Vigorous Enforcement of the Law Another guideline for any effective civil_rights program is vigorous enforcement of the law The national Administrations failure to enforce civil_rights laws has caused great disappointment Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  bans discrimination in all Federally assisted programs But not until May of  did the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare announce that Federal funds would be withheld from school districts that practice discrimination One year after passage of the Civil Rights Act the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that there were discernible patterns of noncompliance in nearly twothirds of the hospitals surveyeddespite the fact that each hospital had received financial assistance from the Federal Government    Weak enforcement can be traced in other areas to inadequate planning and staffing Moreover some enforcement procedures have proved to be ineffective tools in rooting out discrimination The complaint system for example has generally proved useless because the burden of filing court suits has been placed on the victims of discrimination Existing civil_rights law must be a more potent weapon in the war against segregation and discrimination Legislation must be vigorously enforced Enforcement agencies must be provided with adequate staffs to provide the necessary leadership And those laws which contain inadequate enforcement procedures must be amended These principles should guide our attack in the following major areas of discrimination in American society I EDUCATION Twelve years after the Supreme Court decision on school segregation virtually no progress has been made in desegregating our schools Only about six per cent of Southern Negro children attend school with white children In both the North and South Negro schools are almost always inferior in quality to white schools and both Negro and white school children now receive an inferior education to the extent that they are not being prepared to live in a pluralistic society The elimination of segregation from the schools is the most critical issue facing American education today The United States Office of Education sets the guidelines under which school systems must desegregate The most recent guidelines of March  are considerably stronger than those issued in the past However despite the May deadline for filing compliance agreements for the   school year by mid July  school systems in the South had failed to submit plans for desegregation as a first step for meeting government demands Close to  more school districts had submitted agreements but attached conditions that may prove unacceptable upon review In the face of this open defiance of the Civil Rights Act of  no Federal funds were withdrawn from school districts that discriminate until May of this year and only  districts were affected at the time Whereas segregation in the South has traditionally been supported by law Northern style segregation commonly referred to as de facto segregation has risen primarily from community custom and indifference segregated patterns of housing and gerrymandered school districts In Philadelphia  percent of the pupils enrolled in public schools are Negro in Manhattan  percent of the children are nonwhite in Washington D C  percent of the pupils in public schools are Negro And the percentages are increasing The tragedy of the ghetto however involves more than the racial concentration of our schools As psychologist Dr Kenneth Clark states segregation and inferior education reinforce each other The quality of education invariably suffers The Federal Government has taken no action in the North in the mistaken belief that the mere threat of withholding funds would force school districts to take steps toward ending de facto segregation But even this threat has been removed with the recent announcement by Secretary of Health Education and Welfare John Gardner that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  did not apply to de facto segregation Recommendations To meet the crisis in education faced in the North and South alike I strongly urge that the following steps be taken  Action on School Desegregation  Prompt and vigorous enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  banning discrimination in all Federally assisted programs is required The Federal Government must not hesitate to cut off funds from school districts which fail to meet the Governments standard To assure this end  Congress should provide adequate staff and funding for the enforcement operation of the Office of Education and should increase its initial appropriation of  to desegregating school districts  Congress should enact Title III of the Administrations Civil Rights Bill of  which would strengthen the Office of the Attorney General in desegregation suits TTiis section would allow the Attorney General to file desegregation suits even if he did not have a written complaint and local residents were financially able to sue on their own behalf  Reducing Racial Concentration Shortterm measures such as the pairing of schools busing for example the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunitiesbetter known as METCOin Massachusetts and open enrollment while quite useful should not be regarded as permanent solutions to the problem of racial imbalance An adequate solution will require metropolitan area planning  Congress should move to clarify the ambiguities contained in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  by enacting legislation which makes de facto segregation of schools illegal and provides for the withholding of funds from school districts which practice de facto segregation The Federal courts should be given the authority to enforce the provisions of the law At present Massachusetts is faced with an anomalous situation in which state funds have been withheld because of de facto segregation in the Boston school system while millions of dollars are poured into the City by the Federal Government  Federal grants issued under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary School Act should be used as incentives to metropolitan planning Federal funds issued for school construction should be used to break up rather than strengthen the patterns of segregation  The states in cooperation with the Federal Government localities and private sector should implement effective metropolitan planning in education Such planning should include the enlargement of school districts new transportation patterns and the construction of new schools aimed at reducing racial concentration  Educational parks in particular represent a promising bold approach to the problem of achieving quality education and more racially balanced schools These school complexes would assemble on a single large campus children from an attendance area broad enough to include both majority and minority children The concentration of students teachers and resources would result in richer programs and more services than any individual school could provide Their strategic location would help alleviate the problem of racial imbalance as well  Teachers and Curriculum Teachers can play a vital role in upgrading the quality of education and in school integration  Where practice teaching is done on a segregated basis the Federal Government should take action under Tital VI of the Civil Rights Act of   State Departments of Education and local Boards of Education should actively recruit and train qualified teachers who are Negro  Congress should provide adequate funding for the National Teacher Corps an imaginative effort aimed at breaking down the vicious cycle of poverty and ignorance in rural and urban slums  A comprehensive system of preschool centers for underprivileged children operating both during the school year and during the summer months is required The hightly successful Operation Headstart program should be expanded systemized and imaginatively administered  Finally new methods of curriculum should be devised Textbooks should reflect a more realistic view of the role of minority groups in our history 
For millions of Negroes housing means the lack of free choice in selecting a place to live and congested ghettos that breed broken homes delinquency illegitimacy drug addiction and crime Since World War II the pattern in housing has been new homes in the surburbs for white families with rising incomes and old homes in central cities for Negroes Indeed the trend in recent years has been accelerating Because I believe the situation in housing has reached crisis proportions I strongly urge that the following steps be taken  Banning Housing Discrimination The Administrations housing bill banning racial discrimination in the sale rental or financing of all types of housing represents a potentially important advance in assuring freedom of choice in the open market This legislation is a significant step toward achieving the promise and spirit of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence Nevertheless the Administrations method of attacking discrimination in housing ignores a more potent instrument  The President could deal with the problem of discrimination in housing more effectively by issuing an appropriate executive order President Kennedys Executive Order No  banning discrimination in FHA and VAfinanced housing covered  per cent of the total housing supply By extending the Executive Order to all housing financed through banks and savings and loan institutions whose deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation FSLIC more than  per cent of the housing supply could be covered  In the absence of an executive order the Administrations Bill should be supported However it should be strengthened in its proposed methods of enforcement The concept of a Federal Fair Housing Board with effective enforcement powersadopted as an amendment in the House Judiciary Committeehas sound precedent in numerous state open housing laws  States and local governments should also take the initiative in ensuring open housing Massachusetts has strong fair housing laws They have been widely accepted by the citizens of the Commonwealth Eighteen states now have similar housing laws on the books These laws should be strengthened and vigorously enforced The Massachusetts Republican Platform of  calling for increased funds and authority for the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination should be implemented  Housing Low and Moderate Income Families Our present Federal and state housing programs have been hampered by inadequate funds poor planning and the power of suburban areas to veto housing plans thus confining subsidized housing to the core city ghetto  A coordinated effort between our public and private sectors is urgently needed to increase the rate of housing production for low and moderate income families The present rate of housing production is only  million units per year Most of this housing is priced beyond the reach of families below the median income level Housing production must be increased to at least  million units per yearat least half of which should be made available to low and moderateincome families Both Federal and state governments and private sources as well should contribute toward filling this gap  Congress should provide funds for the Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD to conduct research in such areas as the amount of substandard housing and the need for lowincome housing in the nation so that Federal programs may be directed to the areas of greatest need  The rent supplement program recently approved by Congress should be made metropolitan wide in scope by elimination of the amendment allowing local government to veto rent supplement projects As originally introduced the rent supplement bill was designed to encourage the development of housing throughout
the metropolitan region and to rent a portion of these new units to low income families under a supplement program The local veto amendment minimizes the possibility of locating units outside of congested city cores  Metropolitan Planning Any attempt to reduce racial concentration in housing must necessarily involve the dispersal of lowincome families through metropolitan planning The various governmental units must undertake joint ventures to meet the problems of both desegregation and increasing the supply of low and moderate income housing on a metropolitan areawide basis  Districts within the metropolitan area should be rezoned and provisions made for low and moderate income housing programs These programs should be comprehensive enough to provide for community services and transportation networks to other areas  Federal and state housing funds going to local governments should be used as incentives for the development of metropolitanwide plans for low and moderate income housing  Revitalization of the Ghetto On a longterm basis the plight of the ghetto can and will be relieved by an open market in housing and meaningful planning of low and moderate income housing outside of the central city In the meantime we must utilize our present resources to rehabilitate the ghetto It is not enough to tear down and renovate our slums Equally important is the need to link the physical rehabilitation of the slum to the social rehabilitation of its inhabitants  The Administrations Demonstration Cities Bill represents a new approach to the problem which deserves to be tested However the program is deficient in its failure to embrace the entire urban community The program should provide incentives for planning on a broader scale for those areas in which the problem of segregation transcends the boundaries of the central city  Community Action Programs provide people living within the ghetto the opportunity to improve their situation through cooperative effort They also serve to call the publics attention to the substandard living conditions of the invisible poor To be effective these programs will require imaginative approaches by governmental agencies at the local state and national levels IV EMPLOYMENT l Millions of Negroes remain untouched by the wealth of our affluent society The unemployment rate among Negroes is seven per cent more than twice the average for whites Often Negroes can only find employment in lowskilled lowwage occupations and industries with the lowest growth rates and the most limited opportunities for advancement Moreover these jobs are most vulnerable to the rapid pace of automation Joblessness among Negro youth is a particularly acute problem As of April   per cent of outofschool Negro youths between  and  were unemployed twice the rate for white youths in the same category These unemployment figures are reflected in the mounting welfare budgets of our major cities Recommendations No single simple quick measure can eliminate these critical problems I strongly urge the adoption of a broadly based action program which includes the following points  New enforcement powers for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  which prohibits discrimination by employers unions and employment agencies should be strengthened At present the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission created by the Act to carry out Title VII can only investigate complaints of discrimination and then seek conciliation If no redress is possible the individual must take the initiative in seeking redress in the courts Because of the complaint system the EEOC has had only negligible impact on employment discrimination In addition the EEOC has been hampered by insufficient investigative powers and resources limited enforcement powers which are complicated and ineffective and a lack of administrative authority to undertake or coordinate manpower development or economic opportunity programs in support of its enforcement activities  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  should be amended to authorize the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to issue cease and desist orders against individuals engaged in unlawful employment practices and to order back pay to those who have suffered financial loss through the denial of equal employment opportunity  State fair employment practices commissions A number of states have made important advances in establishing state antidiscrimination commissions However the effectiveness of these state agencies has often been limited by inadequate financial support and excessive restraint in enforcement  States should take the initiative in strengthening state fair employment practices commissions     Eliminating discrimination in trade unions In spite of the progress made by labor unions to promote equal employment practices a number of unions continue to discriminate against Negroes Unions have a special obligation to make a place for those against whom they and employers have too long discriminated I urge therefore that  Government contracting authority in accordance with the Civil Rights Act of  and an executive order banning discrimination on work done by Federal contract be used to insure equal employment practices and expanded training opportunities on all Federal projects It is regrettable that the Department of Labor and Justice did not initiate action against trade unions to enforce nondiscrimination on government contracts until February   Unions on all levels evaluate and revise all programs and practices that discriminate unfairly in job placement job training or advancement National union leadership should take affirmative action against unions that continue discriminatory practices  Unions increase job opportunities in the skilled crafts and building trades by a actively recruiting Negroes and others into craft unions b establishing preapprenticeship training to help Negro youths qualify for apprenticeship programs  Metropolitan Job Councils  Metropolitan Job Councils should be established by private sources in all major urban areas to plan coordinate and implement local programs to increase job opportunities for Negroes Membership should include representatives of business organized labor education and other appropriate community organizations These councils would accumulate uptodate information on the Negro labor force and job opportunities in the area and would help coordinate and improve existing programs Technical assistance would be offered by the Councils to help employers and unions make positive efforts to recruit Negro workers and eliminate unnecessarily rigid hiring specifications  Rural employment programs Many marginal farmers have become victims of mechanization shrinking acreage allotments and racial prejudice The migration of unskilled rural Negroes to urban areas has created additional problems Between  and  the number of Negro farmers decreased by  per cent To meet these problems I recommend that  The Secretary of Agriculture move immediately to implement the recommendations of the United States Civil Rights Commission aimed at the elimination of segregation in Department of Agriculture programs The Secretary has made little progress in implementing the report which is now over a year old The Department of Agriculture extend to Negro farmers the necessary assistance information and encouragement to give them the equal opportunity to diversify their farm enterprises  Federal state and local agencies and private groups as well cooperate in the development of comprehensive programs to facilitate the adjustment of rural families moving to urban areas Centers should be created in rural surplus labor areas to help potential migrants make arrangements for jobs and housing and should provide vocational and personal counselling  Employment programs for Negro Youth Programs for intensive counselling of Negro youth the sector of our population with the highest incidence of unemployment are grossly inadequate The need exists for yearround youth job placement services  Counselling services for inschool youths should be improved and expanded with the aid of skilled vocational advisers acquainted with requirements of industry Expanded high school vocational education programs are also needed in urban and rural areas to train youths effectively for occupations in which employment opportunities are available  Business and industry should work closely with schools and labor unions through Metropolitan Job Councils where possible to gear inschool training realistically to job requirements and to broaden inservice training opportunities
Negroes are subject to more illnesses and disabilities than white people they lose between one and onethird times as many days of work from disease or disability and have a higher infant mortality rate and a seven years shorter life expectancy The figures are integrally related to poor living conditions and inadequate health care The effects of inadequate health care are compounded by discriminationespecially in the South Despite the fact that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of  bans discrimination from health facilities receiving Federal funds widespread discrimination against Negroes still exists Negro doctors dentists and technicians are all too often refused staff privileges and excluded from professional societies Negro nurses are excluded from training programs paid lower wages and forced to eat in segregated cafeterias and Negro patients continue to be placed in segregated wards The persistence of this discrimination can be traced in large part to the failure of the U S Department of Health Education and Welfare to take steps necessary to achieve compliance with the law Effective enforcement action has not been taken Except in cases where complaints have been filed field inspections have not even been made to ascertain the extent of noncompliance To remedy these abuses in medical care I strongly urge that the following steps be taken  Enforcing compliance in health care  HEW should conduct surveys and thorough field examinations to determine the extent of discrimination in federally assisted health programs Funds should be withheld from those hospitals which continue to discriminate against Negroes in violation of the Civil Rights Act of  Finally HEW should take steps to ensure that hospitals participating in the Medicare program comply with Federal laws against discrimination  Improved Health Services While the new programs of Medicare and medical aid for the indigent represent increased provision of medical services to low income families many of whom are Negro they should be supplemented by  Additional experimentation in the concept of neighborhood health centers which provide a range of health services on a coordinated basis to all members of the family in a single location The neighborhood health center sponsored by Tufts University in the Columbia Point housing development is an excellent example of how health services can be more effectively delivered to low income families that would not otherwise receive them  Comprehensive study and evaluation of ways of improving the quality and availability of medical services to low income families in both urban and rural areas  Medical Research  Organizations both private and public should undertake thorough studies to examine the causes of the Negros high infant mortality rate and lower life expectancy and should develop a comprehensive plan of attack on these problems The continued disparity between the Negro and white population in these vital statistics is cause for deep national concern
 Protecting Negroes and civil_rights workers The tragic shooting of James Meredith in Mississippi was one in a series of violent acts committed against civil_rights workers Since  an estimated thirty Negro and white civil_rights workers have been murdered in the South while countless others have been the victims of beatings bombings maimings and shootings The continuing failure of allwhite juries to convict assailants has in addition focused the nations attention on the gross inequities in the jury system in the South We can no longer tolerate a system of justice in which Negroes and civil_rights workers are not free to exercise their constitutional rights We can no longer postpone fulfillment of our national pledge to liberty and justice for all It is time to guarantee that justice will be done throughout the nation A number of bills pending before Congress and sponsored by Republicans and Democrats alike are designed to remedy these flagrant abuses I urge that Congress enact a strong civil_rights bill during this session one that includes in this area the following  Provision for a representative crosssection of the population on jury lists thereby eliminating discrimination on the grounds of race or color in jury selection  Removal of certain criminal cases to the Federal courts where state jury selection procedures are not in accordance with Federal procedures  Greater Federal protection against intimidation of Negroes and civil_rights workers including stronger Federal criminal penalties for those who deprive individuals of their federally protected rights  Amendment of the United States Code so that local county and city governments are held jointly liable with officials employed by the government who deprive persons of rights protected by the Code  Establishment of an Indemnification Board within the Federal Government with authority to grant money damages to the persons whose federally protected rights have been violated  Voting Rights The Voting Rights Act of  largely removed the legal barriers to voting However apathy fear and ignorance continue to impede Negro registration and voting While Congressional action in the area of voting is not now needed the Administration must take the lead in enforcement It has not yet enforced the law in large areas of the South notably Georgia Beyond enforcement the Administration must provide more imaginative and innovative voter registration education where it has sent Federal examiners Pamphlets and posters in all Federal facilities advertising voter registration might be used Finally voter registration hours should be better advertised in Southern communities  Home Rule for the District of Columbia Since  the people of Washington D C have been under the jurisdiction of the Congresstheir pleas for selfgovernment largely ignored The situation is made more intolerable by the fact that  per cent of the population is Negro while ten members of the powerful House District Committee are from the South That this situation should exist in a nation which prides itself on its democratic principles is deplorable enough But that such a situation be permitted to continue in our nations capitol is reprehensible Attempts to get a home rule bill through Congress this year have once again failed But this issue must not be allowed to die I strongly urge Congress to act and to restore democracy to our nations capitol once more f  fcMg   r The challenge of a Great Society cannot be fulfilled until we have achieved an Open Society with equal opportunity for all Americans to obtain quality education enjoy the minimum comforts of decent housing sustain a potentially healthful existence and gain access to the material benefits of our abundant free economy This challenge is a particularly fitting one for the Republican Party as the party of Lincoln to undertake It is a challenge underlined by the noble purpose and inspiration of a uniquely American dream For over the course of more than three centuries we have dared to seek r strength for our society by giving freedom to its members We have liberated common men and women and have discovered uncommon faith and power We have dedicated ourselves to the importance of the individual and have achieved unparalleled greatness as a nation As a people we must now fulfill the promise of that dream We must build a truly Open Society where all men have the right to achieve their individuality where every man has the right to participate in the American dream

POWER as dej Till £ scribed by its initiator  I® K Stokely Carmichael g Chairman of the StuKSCJi i  TVT    dent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee SNCC is both a slogan and a political and psychological technique As a slogan it has the value that others do but as a technique for achieving change and rallying together the most powerless groups in American societythe Negro poorit has enormous potential The national reaction to both the slogan and technique has been directed for the most part by advocates of a counter position in the white and Negro communities those who are spokesmen for white fright Contending for the national title as leading spokesman for the white fright advocates is Eugene Patterson editor of the Atlanta Constitution Believing as do most white frighters that Negro militancy equals riots rape and in a favorite phrase of white fright supporters irreparable harm to the Negro movement the Constitution under Patterson has devoted almost more editorial space in recent weeks to denouncing Black Power than he has to supporting his papers hawkish position on the Vietnam war It is too easy to characterize the  opponents of Black Power as weakkneed moderates or even as clever divide and conquer manipulators who aim at destroying the surface unity that exists among the various Negro civil_rights groups The white fright position is basically that American whites have admittedly been brutal and oppressive with  years of white power therefore Black Power will mean that Negroes will be brutal and oppressive if they ever get the upper hand This masochistic wishful thinking both deplored and welcomed as proof of the incompetency of Negro militants springs from a desire to eliminate the militantand therefore uncontrollable  sectors of the Negro movement It amounts to little more than a refinement of the McCarthy eras Redbaiting techniques and might well be called Blackbaiting But the best analysis of the white fright conditionand its reaction to Black Powerhas come strangely enough from a white metropolitan daily newspaper the Boston Herald whose lead editorial Reexamining Black Power on July   reads Black Power has claimed its first two victims They are Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Roy Wilkins executive secretary of the NAACP Both men honored veterans of the civil_rights movement succumbed temporarily at least to the most ancient of maladies the inability to adjust to a new idea The editorial described Humphreys criticism of Black Power as racism and apartheid and gave Wilkins description of Black Power as Black death It went on to say we find nothing subversive in SNCC Chairman Stokely Carmichaels remarks On the contrary says the Herald this type of thinking is both practical and traditionally American Nor should the older generation of civil_rights leaders object to the young Negroes wanting to run their own show with white men supporting rather than dominating the various organizations This should be interpreted as a sign of maturity It means that Negroes having won their legal rights under the old system are now ready to work toward their goals under their own leadership like any other minority This too is traditional American history does not show that the Irish were content to be led by Yankees or that working men were content to be led by their employees In short we are suggesting that the older generation of civil_rights leaders avoid the mistakes of Hubert Humphrey and Roy Wilkins and resist the urge to panic at the sound of Black Power 
judiciallegislative front the writer defined the new challenge facing Negro leaders as    the building of pride selfrespect and selfesteem and confidence of Negroes as a group  Such advice was not taken then  and probably wont be taken now but The Challenge is still present and the recent disruptions in the civil_rights movement over the term Black Power clearly indicate that the need is more urgent than ever and that NeThe editorial ends with a warning to both white and Negro advocates of white fright We suggest that the older civil_rights generation reexamine this new concept of direct action and concentrate on the more thoughtful speeches of black_power advocates These young men are surprisingly realistic and are fully aware of both their capabilities and their limitations And like it or not they are destined to be the doers of the new era of civil_rights Whether they do good or evil depends in part on whether their predecessors encourage or repress them
APPARENTLY the  A  Civil Rights Move  ment has now reached s a P°int wherein the old  ways of doing things can no longer disguise the fact that our present tactics cannot budge the immovable stumbling block white Americas rigid determination to keep black Americans in their placewhich most of our leaders have long pretended would give way in only a matter of time The only alternative to the Civil Rights Movement itself it seems to me would be stagnation or riots and more riots I think that what we really need is a complete reevaluation of the aims and methods of most of our civil_rights organizations Also I believe it is long past time when we should stop pointing to the token gains made by the few amongst us and turn our full attention to the plight of the deprived and relentlessly oppressed many I think too that we must stop deluding ourselves with the belief that there are many white people of good will who are eagerly standing by to help in our allout fight for complete equality That there are some white people of good will cannot be denied but it should be obvious to all black folk by now that such white folk are few and far between If we are ever to find any solution to our increasingly intolerable situation we must go to the people themselves to our unfortunate brothers and sisters left behind in the shanties and the shacks and the teeming ghettos and listen to their ideas for only those who face the enemy qua enemy on a daily basis can really know the magnitude of the battle that lies ahead And only they can really know how they want to conduct their fight And I believe this is precisely what SNCC has been doing and why directly or otherwise it has come up with the term Black Power I believe this is SNCCs way of trying to inculcate in black people the idea that if we are to survive we must somehow gain a sense of solidarity and rid ourselves of the old feelings of helplessness and inferiority that have always paralyzed us in America That SNCC has really hit upon something can be readily ascertained by the instant and overwhelming hostility shown by the national press and a majority of those in the white community to ward this one twoword slogan To be sure it is more than just a slogan it is symbolic of a possible way of life a way of life that terrifies the white American even before it is realized For if we finally wake up to the fact that we too have power we will no longer willingly play the lackey for the white man who will then not only lose some of his selfContinned from page  esteem when he loses his ancient doormats but this same white man lives in constant fear that we will some day enslave our former masters That this idea is utterly irrational is beside the point After all if man were wholly rational he would never have been a bigot in the first place would he
THE current crisis facing f rTT y the civil_rights movement has the quality of death written in characters of blood fire and selfdestruction It is a killer stalking human preyand finding Tj only Americans without hearts religion intellect or democracy The American dream is failing so to speak and Americans are proving to be just plain white people living a democratic lie in a nondemocratic society Americans are proving by their actions that they are psychologically incapable of developing a native and original multiracial culture America has become a land of guiltridden illiterate and fearful proletarians White men and black men have failed to discover each other White mothers fear for their daughters Black mothers fear for fear of their husbands Amalgamation is not a concept but a condemnation To a nation tall and tense such is the stupid dread of a Christian society A nation of Christians spitting on priests and nuns and Negroes Here is the sad evidence of another Rome in ashes but Nero is a realtor heard in the choir on Sunday mornings Nero is a white homeowner or businessman standing against the windy sunlight looking for Cleopatra in the ghetto Nero is the black man afraid to give up his belly needs for his dignity This land of Lincoln and Du Bois cries for interracial hot blood as a monument to its stupidity In spite of all the prophets in spite of all the warnings and sincere whites and blacks we shall not overcome unless a blackwhite Jesus arises or Willie Mays picks up a gun instead of a bat The alternative is blood or blessedness everything or nothing It is black brown and yellow men against the Western sleepwalker and at the same time it is the population asking the rest of the human race to preserve humanity Black men must take by any means they can the blindfold from justice There are some wars in which a careful disorderliness is simply good tactics and whoever said that the socalled black revolution is anything else but a war against ignorance Any man can die or be destroyed for his country but only a Negro an American Negro there is no other can save it If Black Power causes fear then black men obviously cause something profoundly deeper in the minds of many white Americans Richard Wright wrote of black_power as a tool to be used by black men everywhere for the sole purpose of freeing themselves Black power is black powder unjamming those solid mountains of white power and hatred Black power may mean black people making decisions and building strong pyramids along the Vile banks of hate in America White America is not aware of such dragon and suggestive language from the Negro Community Black Toms have not used such humorless and truthpiercing phrases before The outcries stem from to my mind the fact that white people have for so long put their words into the mouths of Negroes that they cant imagine the coming of strong new voices unrelated to Marian Anderson or Ralph Bunche 
MY opinion is that the civil_rights movement is not at the crossroads per se The very nature of the movement itself dictates that crisis become an integral and accepted part of its existence What the civil_rights movement is after is a chance for black Americans to share in the power and the privileges which have previously been allocated to the whites and a Negro elite It is a struggle to get the powerful and the privileged to relinquish their inequitable grip and let people in America share in the wealth and potential of America as Americans and not as Negroes Jews Orientals Puerto Ricans and WASPs As Kenneth Clark states in The Negro American No group of human beings can easily and graciously give up power and privilege Such change can only come through conflict and anguish and the everpresent threat of retrogression Being an underdog minority movement civil_rights is constantly subjected to emergencies and pressures and crisis is never any further away than the next confrontation with whites the next split in leadership or the fight against racism itself becoming racist Having witnessed the Civil Rights Movement survive both neardefeats and defeats I can only state that the fervor and determination for a successful resolution to the blight of racial inequality is so deeply rooted as to allay any fears that may exist about there being some ongoing form of active and dedicated civil_rights activity We have now lived with more than a decade of Civil Rights agitation For many this has become one of the basic elements of existence They cannot even remember when this was not an issue vital and pressing in their lives They are not going to be turned back But if the questions posed above refer to the fact that it would appear the Movement is at the crossroads regarding what form of strategy will be utilized then I believe we have a more fruitful question for debate Typically civil_rights thrusts have been basically nonviolent in nature The largest groups within the movement up until recently have steadfastly maintained a peaceful posture With the advent of the slogan Black Power and the vagueness and frustration that it represents there is a new crisis in the civil_rights movement As I mentioned earlier crisis is the common denominator of the civil_rights movement The question is of course is this new crisis of significant impact to actually represent enough of a threat to make significant numbers of people see it as an actual choice or alternative to nonviolence as the basic strategy characteristic The original question essentially asks what is the alternative to the nonviolent tactic in the struggle for equal rights The only practical alternative I can see to nonviolent tactics on the part of Negroes is a wholesale and genuine acceptance and implementation of equal rights on the part of whites Just as I do not see white America relinquishing its preferred position voluntarily so I dont see any long term practicality in black violence Too many Negroes are becoming involved in pragmatic answers to a basically moral and ethical question This makes us subject to the same kinds of expediencies and rationalizations that greatly account for the position we find ourselves in vizavis the whites Negroes trying to explain and distinguish kinds of violence remind me of whites trying to justify separate but equal My response to question number two is that Black Power is subject to the same vagueness and great latitude of interpretation as is any slogan attempting to simplify a massively complex thing such as the emotion and feeling of   people We Americans have a deeprooted fear of the word power Our whole national trend is based on the fear of power being concentrated When we link this basic fear and distrust of power with the basic fear distrust and ignorance of black humans we have something that both fascinates and frightens whites The press is alert and very swift to pounce upon anything of this nature in its business of making headlines The public reaction if we can identify one was similar to that of people discovering that unidentified flying objects do in fact in some form exist It is frightening because for so long we were told they were objects of the imagination Suddenly we are faced with the realization that some strange force in a somewhat identifiable form which may or may not be harmful does in fact exist For me the essential question is this Can the struggle against racism be justified if it in turn becomes racist itself The Civil Rights Movement is being pressed to choose between the peaceful dignified and effective posture of nonviolence and the racisttinged call for defensive violence This defensive violence is not a case of fighting fire with fire but rather a case of lighting a forest fire with matches Negroes are a minority in America We have the least money housing education and most important power We are not going to get power commensurate with numbers if we choose to fight the white man with the tools he used to subjugate us We are superior to the extent we press constantly for American ideals and their acrosstheboard fulfillment while the whites ignore them Further to the extent we do this in a dignified and intelligent manner we will be more successful in our demands than they in theirs The black nihilists notwithstanding I think that the majority of black Americans are interested in nam war and a desire for structural changes in the American economy Black Power This muchmaligned and misunderstood term simply means the marshaling of all power available to the black communities throughout Americapolitical social economicto force the kind of changes necessary to end white oppression Black power grows out of a clear realization that there are power forces among whites responsible for this oppression and that counter forces equal or superior in strength will have to be used against white society to end conditions causing racial discrimination So quick and hostile a reaction from whites stems from their misinterpretation traditional fears of Negro closeness and more importantly the fear that the customary battle lines in the civil_rights movement will be changed to the advantage of Negroes In other words whites could see fighting the battle if the most effective weapon Negroes could muster was a feeble appeal to moral conscience arrayed against the massive weight of white economic and political control of Negro neighborhoods Now that segments of the Movement have proposed fighting the battle on different grounds using weapons which propose not only to hurt the white mans conscience but his pocketbook and traditional political position as well whites are taking a second more frightful look Perhaps a more fundamental reason for whites adverse reaction to black_power has been their inability to adjust psychologically to the sudden shift in the Negro mood from one of patient plodding toward eventual freedom to defiant audacious demands for Freedom Now Their failure to adjust to and accept the political economic and social rearrangements black_power demands made a rash emotional outcry from whites leading to misinterpretation almost inevitable 
THERES no question  that the Movement is £ at the crossroads but £ to understand why J you have to go back to the late s before the term Black Power became popular During the latter half of the decade and into the early s a combination of historical developments  dissolution of European empires in Asia and Africa the Castro revolution in Cuba the sitins and Freedom Rides in the South the burgeoning peace movement among othersproduced a class of impatient young rebels who were grossly intolerant of the gap between Americas preachments and practices Among these youthful radicals were Stokely Carmichael Marion Barry and John Lewis all leaders of SNCC at one time Mario Savio and Bettina Aptheker student leaders at Berkeley Clark Kissinger Tom Hayden Bob Ross and other leaders of Students for a Democratic Society Essentially these radicals are telling America to practice what she preaches or suffer the consequences in the arena of world politics In the civil_rights movement the leaders of SNCC and CORE heavily influenced by the developments referred to have split off from the more conservative NAACP National Urban League and SCLC because the traditional methods of change have not closed the gap between theory and practice fast enough At the heart of the schism are these burning questions the answers to which will largely determine in which camp the masses of black people will enlist and thusly which road the Movement will take from here on  Can the Movement tolerate such a deep split at a time when quest for rights had been doing all their born days This parade saw leaders taking part in a pushshove match with beefbellied cracker cops at one point and spouting pussyfoot oratory over the privilege of pitching a tent at another Meanwhile the great white fathers in Washington were engaged in a marathon goosestep operation of successive steps to water down sections of this years civil_rights actand an act it is becoming which if the waterdown process continues must stop just short of liquidation pun intended Everytime unrest boils up in the black community the white folks simply pass another rights act or bill to quiet them down for a spell But alas the Meredith marchers emerged at the back of a pickup truck bed on the campus of a Negro college where leaders were revealed to be infinitely more in accord on the matter of who would foot the bills than who would be permitted to caress the mike and serenade the crowd Predictably they later wound up chastizing one another and chestizing themselves But in this they were of course doing what they do best entertaining and kowtowing to white folks and wobbly financiers Mind you this is not to say that all of the fault of the foregoing rests on leaders alone They can be no better than their followers It is in large part the mental attitudes of their followers which reduce leaders to fundraising gimmicks geared to white pocketbooks and make it virtually necessary that they court coverage in the white press in order to emerge and remain as Negro leaders We Negroes will never get too far as a group so long as a Negro must go through the white press in order to reach us so long as we depend on white sources for information and ideas about ourselves What in my opinion can be done about the situation It is hard to say in a brief discourse but to begin with the Movement was crippled from the start by an ultra assimilationist craze for acceptance at all costs into a morally decadent white cesspool now cynically called The Great Society They have stupidly therefore placed love in a position of priority over respect from which love of necessity in the long run must flow Frankly my hope is with the future generations This generation may bethough slightly less so than their parentsalready it is sad to say just a bit too far lost although this is not to give up on them entirely For this reason I like the budding movement for freedom schools I would add as adult counterparts TNT clubs T o w a r d Negro Togetherness which among other things would periodically hold soul talks and agitate at the grass roots level among Negroes for business enterprise and educational achievement These may eventually manage to teach black children what I call an enlightened blackness a dynamic new sense of Negritude The main drawback of the schools up to now has been the necessity for using women white mainly as teachers and moderators This is due in large part to the reluctance of Negroes to donate their own leisure their fear of blackness and the fact that men are for the most part away at work or standing somewhere watching pretty girls go by or trying to make it to the next broad Consequently the black child still suffers a shortage of male models and there is no one to teach black boys the arts of karate and boxing for example as muchneeded psychological mechanisms not so much for selfdefense as this is not no matter what you may have heard the Age of Flesh and Bones alone in weaponry With a new burst of pride the black child also would gain the sense of aggressive persistence necessary for getting ahead in a successcrazed society This is essential provided they are not going to reject capitalism altogether and by rejection I do not mean merely failing to take as tenacious a part in the system as possible a course they have followed in the past Why for example are four out of five Jewish persons of college age in school two out of five orientals about one out of five white Christiansand so few Negroes by comparison To argue that it is merely because Negroes experience a harsher degree of discrimination is to overlook the fact thatas the foregoing figures suggestmajor groups discriminated against except for Negroes Mexicans Indians and Puerto Ricans exceed the college entrance standard set by the Anglo Saxon discriminators What we lack are pride and industry and nothing else will fully solve the black mans problems until he has those things The cohesion necessary for breaking down barriers will flow naturally from that else either the few barriers broken down by other means will seldom be utilized maximally by Negroes as a whole So in a larger sense it is not the civil_rights movement socalled at the crossroads it is the misled leaders the Uncle Toms Rev Sambos and Dr Thomases who have come to the crossroads as indicated by their increasing necessity for revealing themselves as Toms leading to a teaming up of the Toms so to speak as over against the one or two true tigers among Negro leaders Rev Kings dream is daily turning into a nightmare although I do not begrudge him his hallucinations of any sort But if Rev King can dream so can I and other children of poverty unlike Rev King and discrimination We have a dream of a new army of black men dedicated to freedom manhood and human dignity We have a dream of soon one morning demanding that the white man give us a chance in America and should it not be at once forthcoming we have a dream of preying instead of praying for our equal rights No we are not beyond flaying either nor swinging instead of singing And we foresee a black blitzkrieg already shown bubbling last summer in Omaha Chicago Cleveland and elsewheremaking America a giant mushrooming Watts in which this country will either solve its problems or get the destruction it deserves So many Negro leaders and other crackpot lexicographers have been taking bushwhacks at the definition of Black Power that if I didnt know better than to believe a word they say Id be completely confused by now Whitney Young for example opines that black_power is neither black nor whiteit is the green of the dollar bill the maroon of the textbook and the gray of the pay envelope Although he is of course quite right on the surface I dont know about that green power talk My pay envelope is brown and whats insidethe paycheckis blue and often leaves me feeling if not looking the selfsame way Frankly I feel fairly certain that Negro leaderswith the exception of Stokely Carmichael and Floyd McKissickdont know what any kind of power let alone black_power means James Meredith for all the effort to educate him in the white folks schools and in Africa still thought that a Bible had more power than a bullet An uneducated white fellow had to teach him a bit of the power of perfunctory piety That is why they spend most of their time defensively explaining what black_power does not mean instead of what it means They plead that black_power is neither antiwhite nor antiblack I believe that black_power is at least problack that it means being black in all areas of the struggle for black manhood among racesby any and all means available to black men and their allies I suspect any informed person who pretends not to know what black pow er means of telling a baldfaced lie They know the meaning of power the ability to influence another even against his will if necessary and the meaning of black Black power then means the ability to make others particularly white folks walk the white chalk line in a way that is of equal benefit to blacks Black power would offset political and paycheck brutalitya cause and thereby automatically obliterate the current cry against police brutalityan effect White power means dollar bills billy clubs trick ballotry and bullets Black power can someday be all of these too but unlike white power which except for greed and a bullyboy psychosis is wielded without a cause black_power is power in selfdefensebut no less deadly in effect It is a phrase which merely spoken is able to scare the hell out of white folks And that is good However I thought at first they were talking about sexual power about the only area in which we Negro males are generally conceded the right to boast of superiority in terms of both equipment and performance And yet as of this writing those who use the slogan appear to believe that it means mainly bloc voting bloc power if you will instead of black_power Indeed in another sense white powerwielders can depend on Negro leaders to block power rather than blacken it Negro leaders including most of those who spout the slogan would be the first to help quell any instance of the use of black_power outside whiteapproved channels Hence one function the slogan has is a kind of capacity for separating the black sheep from the colored goats among Negro leaders Still should some leaders manage to make black_power materialize white liberals would tryand probably succeed intaking it over Indeed one of the main reasons for white opposition to the phrase is its threat to white liberal power in the civil_rights movement Note that more than  preachers almost all white took out a full page ad in the New York Times presenting a couple of thousand explanatory words and offering to provide the power structure more on demand to interpret the phrase The white presswhich unfortunately just about everybody gets his cueflew into a rage in a fearstricken effort to befuddle the concept Even colored critics threw up the smokescreen of a black state and the difficulty of colored folk getting along together let alone running a state I do not think black_power advocates as a whole are calling for a separate state They appear to believe that as soon as we separate off the white folks will simply drop an atom bomb on us However Negroes will eventually have separate cities anyway and now comprising twothirds of the District of Columbia will soon have an allNegro state Then we can move the White House to Howard University and call it the Black House Even Rev Kingmay the Lord have mercy on his soulprofesses to blame the black_power slogan for sapping the strength of the wobblylegged Meredith March prophesies that black_power would be equally as evil as white power and has the holy gall to call on colored folk to think in terms of shared power White politicians quickly caught something of this demoniacal deception Hubert Humphrey stood with solemnfaced piety and told an audience of purplegummed Negro leaders that black men are becoming racists while LBJ limplipped a barefaced weaselworded line about being against white or black_power I believe that they see as clearly as I do Black Judgment Day around the corner They can wait and see what it means
NOT only the Civil v r g Rights Movement but I vU the entire United at the crossroads Negroes will no longer live on the periphery of the country they are expected to live and die for Whites must decide whether it is better to share the country with all of its citizens or to face continual disruption of business as usual resulting in deterioration of all phases of American life For our Negro leaders who are fast losing their following there could be no better rallying cry than Black Power Instead of hysterically denouncing this cry the civil_rights organizations should grasp  the opportunity to harness the energy of those who have lost hope and are floundering in violence and to channel this unused and undeveloped power into constructive and practical effort toward economic power political power educational power the power to protect ourselves from physical and emotional harm the inner power that comes with selfesteem the power to develop to full stature as human beings The white press is as usual attempting to create the situation it ostensibly seeks to preventan explosion that would obviate the necessity for sharing the power and sell a few newspapers as a side benefit Or failing that to suppress the movement by instilling in the white public the fear of reprisal for its crimes and in our responsible leaders fear of censure from liberal whites The only white power that will diminish with black_power is the power of whites over blacks All other white power will increase proportionately since in this country white power plus black_power plus yellow power plus red power equal American power Thats the way it is
THE day the civil_rights movement began it r i II £ was at the crossroads SU And that day by the way was not the day the proud black lady refused to get up from her seat on the bus It was the day the first black slaves said no to his slave owner and that was nearly  years ago The black mans fight for human rights has never been such a socially acceptable thing as it is today but it has always been in motion even though it sometimes manifested itself as no more of a nuisance than a fly on the back of a rhinoceros The thing that amazes me about the whole civil_rights movement though and my black brothers and sisters is that we have been able to strip ourselves of our conditioning and see a reality that our white countrymen have not yet begun to see We have though existing within the framework of this most hostile society dedicated to the perpetuation of black men as inferior beings and make no mistake about it this society is in fact dedicated totallyperhaps even at the risk of destroying the world to the principle that the black man will not be equal been able to rise above our negative conditioning and at this very moment although perhaps they dont deserve it we are plotting the course of saving the whole goddamn world What thrills me about us is our tremendous stamina Even though they infiltrate the ranks of some of our best organizations and render them almost totally ineffective another organization is born every time they hamper the established one and that organization fights even more vigorously than the parent group And while it lives in its effective state it slashes away at the injustice about us and brings us still closer to the goals that we will attain because we are not only black and beautiful but we are the children of the most oppressed of our times and we are the ones who are aware of injustice and we are the ones who will right all the wrongs perpetrated against us and our ancestors and we are the ones who will save the world and bring a new day a brilliantly alive society that swings and sings and rings out the world over for decency and honesty and sincerity and understanding and beauty and love What are the alternatives if we are presently at the crossroads The alternatives are simple And I always seem to oversimplify thingsperhaps because I see them so clearly that I dont have to be bogged down in trivia we fight on with every facility available to us and we wait We fight on in every city and town in the country We fight on and we spread the love we have been told we cannot feel for ourselves to each and every black man we meet We fight on and we see in our black brothers and sisters the dignity they tried to tell us they had but we could never know We fight on and at the same time we look about us and wait We look about us and wait because somewhere somewhere in the tenements in Harlem or from the west side of Chicago or from Watts there will be another  other white power will increase proportionately since in this country white power plus black_power plus yellow power plus red power equal American power Thats the way it is Continued from page  Malcolm and this one wont be murdered There will be another Malcom and his words will reflect the emotions the ideas the beliefs the worries the torture of those from the bottom as well as those from the top Yes the man on top too because the black man at the top is just as disenfranchised as the man who walks through the alley picking up pop bottles to get the price of his bottle of wine Somewhere there will be another Malcolm and we will again have a universal voice But even if we dont find another Brother Malcolm we will still fight on because we are a people who know only one way and that is the way of accomplishment the way of victory Weve never really lost you know not even a battle Even the fact that we fight is a victory    what are the practical alternatives to it I keep thinking of that I laugh to myself because every black man in this country is aware that our time has come Yes even those who have sold out and have been granted the luxury of thinking they are white and have been allowed the accept ance of the establishment still feel something when they see their precious black women largely relegated to the role of domestics still tighten up when they see black children suffering in their inhuman world bleed when they hear of a black family destroyed because of a bombing when they pass through the area of the most disenfranchised in their airconditioned automobiles They feel their blackness They know it God dont hate them please because theyll be back Theyll be standing in the line when the time comes because their blackness will not let them escape their responsibility to the brave dead blackmen who have made their success possible Today without a word passing between them one black man looks at another one and instinctively they know that they will not tolerate another hundred years of economic slavery And if it means that some of us have to die to get our point across to the world then we will die But we will not die meekly We will not die without making our statement Its true that we are really no prouder than any other oppressed people in history but we are the last of the long sufferers And as a result of our oppression we have gained a dignity our oppressors can never have and we try just a little harder than the man on top we do just a little better job than he does and we are a hell of a lot more alive God it must be terrible not to be born black in this day and age
THE fact that CORE and   i  SNCC have taken difI ferent roads from the  NAACP the Urban League and SCLC does not lead me to believe that the civil_rights movement as a whole is at a crossroads where one road can lead to success and the other to disaster The older organizations  are continuing in the way they have always taken using legal techniques moral persuasion nonviolent demonstrations and cooperation with whites There has been a tendency in the two younger organizations to develop grassroots leadership and power a tendency which is now coming to the fore Instead of taking one road the civil_rights movement is taking two roads In my opinion this is a good thing as the problem of racism cannot be solved by any panacea It needs to be attacked on a variety of fronts by whatever tactics is most effective in a given situation Our leaders have used too much energy in fighting and criticizing each other From the utterances of some of them it would seem that other Negro leaders are greater enemies to the civil_rights movement than white bigots Every one has his favorite solution strategy and tactics but that does not mean that other tactics and approaches are not effective and should not be used I would not consider the civil_rights movement to be at a crossroads because if direct political action fails there is still the alternative of legal and persuasive techniques employed by the older organizations If these methods prove ineffectual there are the techniques of political and economic mobilization already adopted by the other two organizations I think we should beware of expecting perfection or Utopia As President Kennedy said life is hard some men spend the war stateside and others are killed I think we should constantly strive toward perfection but not be too disappointed if we do not achieve it In my opinion Black Power means organizing black people so that they can have power commensurate with their numbers in their communities states and in the nation This will mean that they may dominate some communities politically will be a strong force in some states and will wield power in the national government This is similar to what other groups have done In the Detroit suburb of Hamtramck for instance the Poles regularly elect a Polish mayor Polish state representatives and senators and Polish representatives to Congress The Irish have long dominated Boston and recently we had an Irish Catholic President We have Catholic power Jewish power Italian power and Armenian power Let there be Black Power too Black people have long voted for whites to represent them now whites should learn to vote for black representatives Its the ability of the man which matters not the color of his skin The adverse reaction of the white press to the phrase Black Power stems from two things the whites attitude toward blacks and their feelings about themselves One of the things which incenses the black man toward the white is his absolute refusal to see the black man To the white he is invisible not there A white makes a movie or a television show about a hospital say where black internes nurses and orderlies are falling over each other but the picture will be lily white There may be a promotion coming up but he never considers competent black workers for the position To him the black man is invisible he does not exist Or he may indeed see the black man but through the distortion of his own preconceptions and prejudice Sixty years ago if you mentioned black writers to a white bigot he would say A nigger write a book How can an ape write a book Today at the term Black Power many whites have the same reaction the only difference is that it is stated in more genteel language The second reason for the whites reaction to the term Black Power is internaltheir sense of guilt When you have kidnapped enslaved beaten murdered raped exploited cheated traduced and  committed injustice toward a race for  years how can you escape feelings of guilt and the fear that they will do to you what you have done to them A people that can burn a man cut off his genitals and toes and distribute them for souvenirs and incarcerate loyal JapaneseAmericans in concentration camps would have long ago reacted violently to such treatment as they have meted out and they fear the black man will do what they would have done They cannot conceive that he can have magnanimity generosity and compassion So far there is no prominent black leader advocating such violence although some have advocated protecting ones self when attacked as is every mans legal and Godgiven right All men are not saints incidentally the only way you can become a saint is through martyrdom and they do not have Martin Luther King Jrs saintly qualities and find it hard to look with compassion upon some policeman who is beating their women or shooting a child or calling them black sonsofbitches Black Power does not mean violence but it will give black men a sense of pride and of solidarity and will make them unwilling to continue to bear exploitation The direction which Black Power will take depends upon White Power If White Power acts wisely and with all speedy urgency in making this a livable country for every man then there will be no reason to fear Black Power
SOMEONE has said that p the Civil Rights Movef ment in the summer of   with its nonviolent marches and its demonstrations had reached the crossroads I believe it would be more accurately descriptive of the At situation to say that the Movement had reached a deadend It was time for a fundamental change of tactics The Supreme Court of the United States had spoken more than a decade earlier All those magnificent Civil Rights bills had been passed or were on the verge of passage Many middle class Negroes and white liberals hailed these landmarks as evidence that at long last America was ready to set a place at the table of the Great Feast for her black sons and daughters so that they too might eat high on that gargantuan hog known as the Great Society From the narrow point of view of the black middle class things were a little betterfor the black middle class that is The white establishment had enough affluence now and enough sagacity and audacity to integrate most of them and at least let them sit at the foot of the table By the time the platter got down to them only the leavings were left but at least they were at long last at the table and in substantial numbers And the leavings in Collier Heights in Atlanta and in Shaker Heights in Ohio and on Long Island and in Westchester and in Crown Heights in Brooklyn were we will admit some fairdemiddling leavings This new approach constituted a definite departure from the Establishments timetested tactic of tokenism Notwithstanding the French have a saying apropos to the situation which translated into English means roughly The more things change the more they remain the same The price the black middle class was called upon to pay was to become an amorphous group without roots or culture dependent entirely on the whims and quirks and ex pediences of the white establishment In a word they were to become white men in black skins They were required to sever any and all connections with the Negro masses an act many of them were very happy to accomplish since they had never looked upon their Negroness as a thing of any intrinsic value At a time when the unity of black people was an absolute essential for achieving liberation many of the black middle class were ready to throw in the towel The struggle was over as far as many of them were concerned The black middle class seemed to think that what they ate made the black masses fat and that when they prospered the black masses prospered automatically and inevitably Meanwhile the gap between the black millions and the black middle class steadily widened at a rate alarming to those who were seriously concerned with achieving economic political and psychological freedom for the majority of black people This should have been and was anticipated by some since it was becoming increasingly clear that the white establishment never had any intention of integrating the black masses Even as the country boasted of a great and prosperous society conditions in black ghettos of the great cities and in the southern backwoods worsened Thus we had reached not a crossroads but a deadend in the Racial crisis So now in the waning months of  the question is posed Is there an alternate route I think there is I have for a long time thought that there were many roads to the Promised Land and the tragic thing is that we have sent all our forces down a single highway and not even the main one but a detour I believe the main highway to black liberation is through a total unification and galvanization of black strength throughout the nation and that nothing short of this will achieve the victory The struggle for integration is pure sham if we do not go to the Integration Table prepared to negotiate from strength Black strength Block by block in the teeming cities plantation by plantation in the southern backwoods and the countryside black folk must be organized for an assault upon the holy citadels of white power Integration comes after liberation A slave cannot integrate with his master In the whole history of revolts and revolutions integration has never been the main slogan of a revolution The oppresseds fight is to free himself from his oppressor not to integrate with him Integration is the step after freedom when the freedman makes up his own mind as to whether he wishes to integrate with his former master For integration to have any real meaning other than reenslavement for the former slave the former slave must approach this decision to be or not to be a part of the Great Society based on a position of strength All else is total hatinhand abjection Here am I old massa take me Thus the concept of Black Power or Black Consciousness is an idea whose day has come It is not a new idea but it is an idea that the situation requires yes demands This concept calls upon us black folk to unify our strength politically economically psychologically and culturally It calls upon us to write our own history create our own myths and legends Washington and Jefferson do not belong to our black children They are not the founding fathers of black Americans they are not our legendary heroes they were our peoples slavemasters No amount of falsification of history can disguise this fact Our legendary heroes are Nat Turner Frederick Douglass Denmark Vesey Harriet Tubman Sojourner Truth white John Brown and red Sitting Bull These and many more are our heroes and most of us have never heard of them Black Consciousness carries with it of course the right of selfdefense Men are not free unless they affirm the right to defend themselves Frederick Douglass understood this more than a century ago Understood it profoundly out of his own lifes experience Reflecting on the time he turned upon Covey a cruel slavebreaker who flogged him daily and worked him past endurance and kept him on starvation rations one day Douglass turned on Covey and soundly thrashed him Douglass writes This battle with Mr Covey was the turning point in my career I was a changed being after that fight I was nothing before I was a man now    with a renewed determination to be a free man    The gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow even death itselfI now resolved that however long I might remain a slave in form the day had passed when I could be a slave in fact      Black Power is not an advocacy of violence It advocates nonviolence but in depth It keeps everybody nonviolent It stays the hands of the practitioners of violence Nonviolence which denies the right of selfdefense encourages and precipitates violence on the part of the practitioners We black folk have a deep need to defend ourselves Indeed we have an obligation We must teach the brutalizers how it feels to be brutalized We must teach them that it hurts Theyll never know unless we teach them Black Consciousness means placing less stress on moving into white neighborhoods and putting more creative energy into changing our own neighborhoods from citadels of despair into monuments of hope It means that all the Harlems of the USA should be in the hands  of Harlemites This is the starting place for black liberation To create black politicians answerable to black constituents and not to the white bosses downtown Black teachers and principals in charge of our public schools in charge of shaping the lives of black children and giving them some sense of pride and dignity and beauty in their blackness Of course the teachers will have to undergo a great deal of debrainwashing since many of them are as contemptuous of black children as are most of the white teachers of whom they are but terribly bad imitations Black Power works toward the day when black folk will control the economic destinies of their communities It seems to me there need be no strong schism at this moment between the advocates of black_power and the black bourgeoisie If one of the principal tenets of Black Consciousness is economic power the starting place is with the black middle class May their tribes increase Black power advocates are no present danger to them One of the great dangers clear and present is the steadily growing chasm between the black middle class and the black masses and he who contributes to this widening gap plays into the hands of the white establishment Why is there this tremendous reaction from the white establishment to this new concept of black_power And why is there this violent paranoiac reaction from the poor white man Let us consider the latter first That is the poor white man He need not feel threatened He has nothing that Black Consciousness wants Fundamentally he is as powerless as the black man The only thing he has that black men lack is his white skin and that is the one thing Black Power does not want Black Consciousness affirms the dignity of blackness Affirms the beauty of our blackness But the white establishment in which all the power is vested does have cause to worry because the black mans aim is to retake the power stolen from him centuries ago Some white politicians are certainly threatened The white leeches in the ghetto are threatened those who feed upon the ghettos misery Power has to come from somewhere since it does not create itself out of a vacuum Therefore black_power must necessarily weaken the stranglehold of the white power structure especially in the black communities This then is what the jumping up and down is all about It isnt that the members of the white establishment do not understand the implications of Black Power and Black Consciousness On the contrary it is precisely because it understands more deeply than do many of us black folk Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn has  black citizens and has never enjoyed black representation in the Congress of the United States The white persons representing Bedford Stuyvesant now are threatened by the concept of Black Power The same can be said for many areas in the northern cities and in the rural areas of the South and every other place where black folk outnumber white folk For if Black Power means anything at all it means One man one vote It means an end to taxation without representation Black Consciousness also threatens the power of some gentlemen in the trade union establishment Yes there are some unions even some progressive ones whose leadership is white and entrenched and whose membership down through the years has become almost entirely black Yet this black membership is not reflected in the toplevel leadership Hence we have white presidents of black unions Undoubtedly some of these white men have given able leadership Notwithstanding the days of Great White Fatherism are numbered on this earth and these leaders good bad and indifferent must be classified as being among the last of the Great White Fathers There has been no parallel in history to the Negro experience in the USA American slavery and the slave trade were undoubtedly the crudest episodes in the entire history of mans inhumanity to man By comparison Roman and Egyptian slavery were humanitarian experiments Considering all the carnage connected with the Slave Trade the  to  million lives lost in the Middle Passage considering the physical brutality connected with the plantation life during the days of American slavery the injury and brutality inflicted upon the minds and souls and personalities of black folk were the crudest aspects of American Slavery the most diabolical and deliberate The white ancestry of this country took a great and prideful people and brought them in chains across a mighty ocean thousands of miles from the land of their fathers broke up their families and clans and tribes robbed them of their language broke their personalities down bit by bit and forged them into niggers Cruder still they made black men believe they themselves were niggers and therefore deserving of their lot as slaves It has been a long tedious journey from slavery to this place this moment in the last part of the Twentieth Century Far far too many of us still regard ourselves as niggers But as we have mentioned before one of the main tasks of Black Consciousness is to affirm the beauty of our blackness to see beauty in black skin and thick lips and broad nostrils and kinky hair to rid our vocabulary of good hair and high yaller and our medicine cabinets of bleaching creams To deniggerize ourselves is a key task of Black Consciousness To rid the world of niggers is the Black Mans Burden  And now we want to proclaim Black Consciousness is not racism It is unequivocably antiracist Its firm dedication is to rid the world of racism Black Consciousness does not teach hatred it teaches love But it teaches us that love like charity must begin at home that it must begin with ourselves our beautiful black selves It advocates a love so powerful that it will settle for nothing short of love in return Therefore it does not advocate unrequited love which is a sick bit under any guise or circumstance Most black folk have no need to love those who would spit on them or practice genocide against them Furthermore in the present confrontation love and hate are total irrelevances Profound love can only exist between equals Generally speaking a slave cannot love his master Any slave who does is out of his mind his cottonpicking mind But masters have always needed to believe in the myth of the loyal slave the loving slave Hence the myths of Uncle Tom and Gunga Din and Aunt Jemima were pure figments of the white mans wish fulfillment some black folks historically have felt an obligation to act out the image to play the coon role according to the script written by the Great White Fathers Some of us still have a need to play the role Correspondingly most white people today demand that black folk either love them or hate them so long as they do not profess indifference to them There is this pathetic need in most white Americans for the black man to be obsessed with them one way or the other Finally Black Consciousness understands that the nigger having been invented to justify American slavery ultimately became the rationale for colonizing three quarters of the human race Thus there evolved two kinds of homo sapiens on this earthexploiter and exploited a master race of white men and a subservient race of niggers Thus evolved such concepts as the White Mans Burden and the noble savage Our mutual heritage with the people of Africa and even on a broader basis our mutual experiences with all the colored peoples of the world visavis the white man create a bond between us and colored people everywhere Black Consciousness proclaims that our struggle for liberation is a part of the great Revolution sweeping the entire world a Revolution against all the Great White Fathers in every nook and corner of this earth In this context we black Americans are no longer a minority but a part of that vast majority of humanity yearning to be free and struggling with every ounce of their strength to throw off the blackmans burden and the yoke of white supremacy We are a part of that fellowship of the disinherited which will surely inherit the earth in this century We are dues paying members in the Brotherhood of Blackness
WHAT ultimately became v worjy the outstanding result i YV £ of the   Neg r Family debate was the excuse it created for a slackening of action to solve the problem that the debate was supposed to be about For a government that wanted to cool it to avoid action that could no longer be avoided without having to take the blame for inaction the Moynihan controversy provided an ideal distraction This conclusion of two eminent sociologists writing in Washington Universitys TransAction points up a lesson that can be drawn from the fuss that has been stirred up over the meaning of Black Power The  distraction developed in the white press only after VicePresident Humphrey and a Negro leader who remains enchanted by President Johnson kicked off the excitement by equating Black Power with black racism The debate that ensued has become almost too tiresome to review in detail it has been dominated by intentional misunderstandings and baseless imputations that have put some sections of the movement even sympathetic white journalists into a state of confusion and disarray A nation that should be awakened to the evils of white racism of the present day and that must be enlightened as the result of white racism of the past is distracted this year by the Black Power scarecrow as it was last year by the Negro Family fuss It is fair to suggest that a government that wants to avoid confrontation with white racism so that it can get on with the war so splendidly supported by racist allies like John Stennis Senate Military Affairs Committee and Mendel Rivers House Military Affairs Committee is pleased to have provided a new diversion As a minority experienced in the selforganization needed to combat persecution and imbued with the selfrespect that has provided morale for that combat American Jews should have had no difficulty in recognizing and welcoming the advocacy of Black Power For many generations we have used in the confines of our family circle a phrase whose meaning was never very different Is it good for the Jews This was a touchstone for viewing political and international developments it was a factor seriously debated before every election It never stood for a parochial Jewish supremacism or racism it was a way of expressing the race pride that went into the racial organization that was so successfully employed in combatting vicious antiSemitism and in watering down the antiSemitism of the polished gentlemens agreement variety We developed organizations which while never having used the phrase Jewish Power built a power structure that has contained and pushed back antiSemitism In the case of the AntiDefamamation League as Harry Golden has pointed out in A Little Girl is Dead the very origin of the organization was as the reaction to the lynching of a Jew in Atlanta by the same foe that the Negro Freedom Movement is fighting today I take pride as a Jew in the contributions these organizations Jewishled and Jewishstaffed have made during the decisive stages of the Civil Rights Revolution One of the really meaningful breakthroughs in the fight against the racism that has characterized public schooling was the AntiDefamation Leagues publication of a study on The Treatment of Minorities in Secondary School Textbooks What the relatively powerless Association for the Study of Negro Life and History had been saying for years was now picked up and pressed as the position of an organization that was trained in the use and application of power getting itself heard and getting its message across A staff member of the American Jewish Congress made what I believe was a pioneer suggestion in a paper on job equality at a CORE conference on Job Equality in  It is not yet official AJC doctrine and the seed has as yet rested on barren soil still there is promise for the future in Staff Attorney Joseph P Robisons thought In particular there is hardly any question that existing seniority rosters and waiting listsfor jobs union membership or training programs can be nullified If they were built up at a time when discrimination was in effect they are tainted with illegality and cannot be relied on This and the many major official contributions made by the American Jewish Congress to the cause of interracial justice far outweigh the negative performance of one of the organizations leaders who resigned in a huff from the national board of CORE because the organization chose to investigate before acting on the Mt Vernon incident That incident involving a temperamental and to me wholly understandable if not forgiveable outburst by a local chapter spokesman provoked beyond endurance by the participation of some local Jews in the resistance to school integration was blown up out of all proportion by the sensational character of the resignation The subsequent attacks on CORE did a great disservice not only to the cause of equality and justice for the Negro but I daresay provoked and stimulated the very antiSemitic sentiments that were supposed to have been protested by the resignation It had and has an unintended side effect it provided a lesson in the importance and justification of Black Power in its most basic sense that Negroes are now in control of their own decisions and no longer want or need whites in key positions of civil_rights groups to  quote Jonathan Randals formulation of the concensus of Negro and white students at this summers National Student Association conference The white liberal veto power over thought and action that comes from a whites being in a position where he can use the threat of the damaging effect of his resignation as a lever to influence policy is dead wrong and its elimination was long overdue A temporary cessation or slackening of the support of those who do not understand this is an unfortunate but necessary price to pay This is not to say that all white liberals are evil or do not have the depth of understanding necessary to continue to be welcome as aides and participants Rabbi A J Heschel for one sensed the importance of Negro leadership and Negro decisionmaking when he wrote two years ago in Jewish World that the problem is above all the regeneration of the moral vigor of the Negro Great spiritual resources of the Negro still lie untapped Black Power can be the key to reaching the masses of the oppressed in the ghettoes whose untapped resources are the key to achieving as Tom Wicker of the New York Times has suggested the unfulfilled promises of the past Who is the lawbreaker wrote Mr Wicker the man who takes his rights by violence or the man who withholds or stifles or trifles with the rights of others As a Jew who remembers that the Rosenwald Fund financed  years ago the work and study that made possible the publication of Dr W E B Du Bois Black Reconstruction I take pride in recalling that the phrase Black Power was coined over four years ago by the brilliant historian Lerone Bennett Jr in his synthesis of the First Reconstruction that was later published as a chapter in his Before the Mayflower The lesson Du Bois taught repeated and retold by Bennett was that the First Reconstruction failed not because there was too much Black Power but not enough As a member of the NAACP I take pride in the fact that the basic premises the real meaning of Black Power were first set forth by Loren Miller then a national Vice President of the Association in his position paper Farewell to the Liberals first published in the Nation and officially reprinted and distributed in  by the NAA CP I rejoice that the rest of the Movement is catching up with his conclusion To liberals a fond farewell with thanks for services rendered until you are ready to reenlist as foot soldiers and subordinates in a Negroled Negroofficered army under the banner of Freedom Now

At a time when most black thinkerswho are not necessarily Negro leaders have alloted to the white man the task of saving the white man it is a rare pleasure to read William Stringfellows Dissenter In A Great Society Holt Rinehart  Winston  Many moral men have separated from the church viewing it as an integral part of the apparatus that sends the havenots the wretched to the gallows of degradation But Stringfellow in his Christian view of America in crisis is something other than the executioner who would use Christianity as a noose With eyes not blinded by Western lye lie the author views poverty property and people Charging this society with the idolatry of money the dominant ethic of white supremacy and the placing of property rights before human rights he brings to bear some of the keener observations yet made on the subject matter The idolatry of money has its most grotesque form as a doctrine of immortality writes Stringfellow Suggesting that money is the basis of ones moral worth in America he observes that if one leaves a substantial estate   death is cheated of victory for a while if not ultimately defeated because the money he leaves will sustain the memory of the man and of his fortune He adds The poor just die and are at once forgotten Stringfellow calls institutionalized private charity a monster   so heavily oriented toward its own maintenance that it has little left over to meet the empirical needs of those whom it purports to help In a word the author sees the current war on poverty as simply more political exploitation citing Mayor Richard Daley and his Chicago machine as perhaps the most aggravated example in the nation On the warfare between the races as he calls it suffice it to say that Stringfellow tells white Americans exactly what crimes they have committed against black people and reflects for them precisely what they themselves have become in the procss at best paternalists at worst racists He suggests that the difference between a Mayor Daley or a Mayor Yorty and a Governor Wallace or a Bull Connor is one of aesthetics not ethics Stringfellows message to his white brothers conversely conveys why today in America moral black men can scream Get Whitey and feel absolutely no remorse over the inclusiveness of their battle cry He candidly states The massive indifference of the ordinary white citizen of good intentions is the moral equivalent of the perfidy of the white racists The profound apathy of the white moderates is ethically tantamount to the radical impudence of the white racists Stringfellow contends that white supremacy must be exorcised if there is to be reconciliation between black men and white men but not unlike most black thinkers he does not see reconciliation as a likely prospect He thinks instead that the white establishment will use its military forcewhite powerand forsees what he calls the day of wrath And it is in this confrontationwhich it seems the events since his writing have brought even closerthat Stringfellow summons white Christians to a most specific witness which he says   must surely be the same as the witness already given by so many Negro Christians during those long years of anguish and protest the witness of the Cross If white people are to practice alas what they have preachedwhich would indeed be a metamorphosis without historical precedentthis witness according to Stringfellow demands that they not protest even if the knife is at the belly At a time when moral and immoral men alike have grown tired of the Gospel one rather doubts that this lay theologians message to the white man will inspire a more humane relation to self and others than did the message of the Messiah for whom his doctrine is named But however one might feel about Stringfellows interpretation of what white people must do it is a testament to his moral courage that he has quite impressively related to them the painful truth of what they have already done and persist in doing And for black people who can afford to buy bookswho are usually those still trying to join middleclass white Americaperhaps this five buck investment will prove antidotal towards the quest for what Stringfellow calls a fair share of the emptinessD Llorens
Bernard Malamud is justifiably considered one of the best serious writers in the United States His book The Fixer Farrar Straus and Giroux  merely adds to the impressive credentials contributing to his present status The Fixer joins The Assistant The Natural and others of Malamuds studies of the nature and character of people times and places Malamud has the ability to develop a mutually complementary character and story line By that is meant that the character and story actually flow together and seem to belong in the same book The Fixer is a Russian Jew a little after the turn of this century The story takes place in Russia but it is readily apparent that witha few subtle changes the story could have taken place in any number of localities to any number of minority groups It is the universality of the plot giving the book its broad base of appeal which makes it a really good book The Jew is unjustly caught in a mire of prejudice suspicion and the law as he passes for a gentile in order to get a better job and is later caught Coincidentally with his arrest for ethnic trespassing he is charged with the unsolved murder of a young boy The most moving and impressive exhibition of Malamuds talent is displayed as he traces the activities and reactions of the fixer to jail The fixer ultimately becomes a martyr not because he is a brave man but because he happened to have the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the right time It is impossible to do Malamud and his book justice in a few short paragraphs Let me suggest therefore that you buy and read it for yourselfBrooks Johnson 
he edge of the spiA y ral of musicians Probe £ sat crosslegged on a blue cl° th his soPra  sax resting against his inner knee his afrohorn linking his ankles like a bridge The afrohorn was the newest axe to cut the dead wood of the world But Probe since his return from exile had chosen only special times to reveal the new sound There were more rumors about it than there were ears and souls that had heard the horn speak Probes dark full head tilted toward the vibrations of the music as if the ring of sound from the six wailing pieces was tightening creating a spiralling circle The black audience unaware at first of its collectiveness had begun to move in a soundless rhythm as if it were the tiny twitchings of an embryo The waiters in the club fell against the wall shadows dark pillars holding up the building and letting the free air purify the mind of the club The drums took an oblique Magwas hands like the forked tongue of a dark snake probed the skins probed the whole belly of the coming circle Beginning to close the circle Haigs alto arc rapid piano incisions Billys thin green flute arcs and tangents Staces examinations of his own trumpet discoveries all fell separately yet together into a blanket which Mojohn had begun weaving on bass when the set began The audience breathed and Probe moved into the inner ranges of the sax Outside the Sound Barrier Club three white people were opening the door Jan a tenor sax case in his hand had his game all planned He had blown with Probe six years ago on the West Coast He did not believe that there was anything to this new philosophy the musicians were talking about He would talk to Probe personally He had known many Negro musicians and their struggles to be themselves were no different from any other artists struggles including his own Things were happening so fast that there was no one who knew all directions at once He did not mind Ron and Tasha coming along They were two of the hippiest ofays in town and if anybody could break the circle of the Sound Club it would be friends and old friends of friends Ron was bearded and scholarly Thickset shabbily dressed but clean He had tried to visit the Club before But all of his attempts had been futile He almost carried the result of one attempt to court He could not understand why the cats would want to bury themselves in Harlem and close the doors to the outside world Rons articles and reviews had helped many black musicians but of all of them Probe Adams had benefitted the most Since his graduation from Yale Ron had knocked around the music world once he thought he wanted to sing blues He had tried but that was in college The best compliment he ever got was from Mississippi John or Muddy Waters one of the two during a civil_rights rally in Alabama He had spontaneously leaped up during the rally and played from his soul Muddy was in the audience and later told Ron Boy you keep that up you gwine put me back on the plantation Ron was not fully satisfied that he had found the depth of the black mans psyche In his book he had said this Yet he knew that if he believed strongly enough some of the old cats would break down His sincerity was written all over his face Holding Tashas hand he saw the door opening    Tasha was a shapely blonde who had dyed her hair black It now matched her eyes She was a Vassar girl and had once begun a biography of Oliver Fullerton Excerpts had been published in Down Beat and she became noted as a critic and authority on the Fullerton movement Fullertons development as an important jazz trombonist had been interrupted soon after Tashas article No one knew why Sometimes Tasha was afraid to think about it If they had married she knew that Oliver would have been able to continue making it But he had gotten strung out on H Sometimes she believed her friends who said Oliver was psychopathic At least when he stopped beating her she forgave him And she did not believe it when he was really hooked She still loved him It was her own love protected deep inside her encased her little black secret and her passport to the inner world that Oliver had died trying to enter It would be only a matter of time She would translate love into an honest appraisal of black music I am sorry the tall brown doorman said Sessions for Brothers and Sisters only Whats the matter baby Jan leaned his head in and looked around as if wondering what the man was talking about I said    Man if you cant recognize a Brother you better let me have your job He held up his case Were friends of Probe The man called for assistance Quickly two men stepped out of the shadows Whats the trouble Brother These people say theyre friends of the Probe What people asked one of the men He was neatly dressed a clean shaven head with large darting eyes He looked past the three newcomers There was a silence Finally as if it were some supreme effort he looked at the three Im sorry but for your own safety we cannot allow you Man what you talkin bout asked Jan smiling quizzically Are you blocking Brothers now I told him I am blood We friends of the Probe The three men at the door went  into a huddle The doorman was skeptical but he had seen some bloods that were pretty light He looked at this cat again and as the other two men were debating whether or not to go get Probes wife in the audience he decided against the whole thing He left the huddle and returned with a sign which said We cannot allow nonBrothers because of the danger involved with extensions Jan looked at the sign and a smile crept across his face In the street a cop was passing and leaned in The doorman motioned the cop in He wanted a witness to this He knew what might happen but he had never seen it Jan shook his head at the sign turning to Ron and Tasha He was about to explain that he had seen the same sign on the West Coast It was incredible that all the spades believed this thing about the lethal vibrations from the new sound The doorman was shoving the sign in their faces as the cop a big pimpled Irishman moved through the group All right break it up break it up You people outside want to come in    The other two men inside seeing the doormans decision and the potential belligerence of the whites folded their hands buddhalike The doorman stood with his back to the door now Listen officer if these people go in the responsibility is yours The Irish cop not knowing whether he should get angry over what he figured was reverse discrimination smirked and made a path for the three He would not go far inside because he didnt think the sounds were worth listening to If it wasnt Harlem he could see why these people would want to go in but he had never seen anything worthwhile from niggers in Harlem Dont worry You got a license dont you Let them go through said one of the doormans friends suddenly A peace seemed to gather over the faces of the three club members now They folded their arms and went into the dark cavern which led to the music In front of them walked the invaders See said Jan if you press these cats theyll cop out They moved toward the music in an alien silence Probe was deep into a rearaction sax monologue The whole circle now like a bracelet of many colored lights gyrated under Probes wisdom Probe was a thoughtful fullheaded black man with narrow eyes and a large nose His lips swelled over the reed and each note fell into the circle like an acrobat on a tight rope stretched radially across the center of the universe He heard the whistle of the wind Three ghosts like chaff blown from a wasteland clung to the wall    He tightened the circle Movement began from within it shaking without breaking balance He had to prepare the womb for the afrohorn Its vibrations were beyond his mental frequencies unless he got deeper into motives He sent out his call for motives    The blanket of the bass rippled and the fierce wind in all their minds blew the blanket back and there sat the city of Samson The white pillars imposing    But how easy it is to tear the building down with motives Here they come Probe healed of his blindness born anew of spirit sealed his reed with pure air He moved to the edge of the circle rested his sax and lifted his axe    There are only three afrohorns in the world They were forged from a rare metal found only in Africa and South America No one knows who forged the horns but the general opinion among musicologists is that it was the Egyptians One European museum guards an afrohorn The other is supposed to be somewhere on the West Coast of Mexico among a tribe of Indians Probe grew into his from a black peddler who claimed to have traveled a thousand miles just to give it to his son From that day on Probes sax handled like a child a child waiting for itself to grow out of itself Inside the center of the gyrations is an atom stripped of time black The gathering of the hunters deeper Coming laced in the energy of the sun He is blowing Magwas hands Reverence of skin Under the single voices is the child of a woman black They are building back the wall crumbling under the disturbance In the rear of the room Jan did not hear the volt nor did he see the mystery behind Probes first statement on the afrohorn He had closed his eyes trying to capture or elude the panthers of the music but he had no eyes He did not feel Ron slump against him Strands of Tashas hair were matted on a button of Rons jacket but she did not move when he slumped Something was hitting them like waves like shock waves    Before his mind went black Jan recalled the feeling when his father had beat him for playing with a nigger and later he allowed the feeling to merge with his dislike of white people When he fell his case hit the floor and opened revealing a shiny tenor saxophone that gleamed and vibrated in the freedom of freedom Rons sleep had been quick like the rush of posthypnotic suggestions He dropped Tashas hand slumped felt the wall give no it was the air and he fell faceforward across a table his heart silent in respect for truer vibrations The musicians stood The horn and Probe drew up the shadows now from the audience A child climbed upon the chords of sound growing out of the circle of the womb searching with fingers and then with motive and as the volume of the music increasedpenetrating the thick callousness of the Irishman twirling his stick outside of black fleshthe musicians walked off one by one linked to Probes respectful nod at each and his quiet pronouncement of their names He mopped his face with a blue cloth Whats the matter here Step aside folks These people are unconscious Look at their faces Theyre dead Dead What happened Dead Its true then Its true
