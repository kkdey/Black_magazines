let us speak with each other for a time about the brotherhood of blackness which might almost just as well be called the k fellowship of the wretched and the disinherited fanon  called us the damned of the earth all of us club members soul brothers and sisters if you will are members of the brotherhood not because we organized this club biologically on the basis of race and color but because of what western man made of the factors of color and race we are members not because we wanted especially to be members we are members because we have been made to pay the dues for membership in terms of being the victims of the crudest exploitation in the entire history of mans inhumanity to man ours is more or less an involuntary membership we have been for centuries the victims of white supremacy that fountainhead of the western judeochristian world white supremacy racism brought the club together all over this unhappy earth and designated the members of the brotherhood as niggers it was the great recruiter but now the time is long past due for us to call the meeting of the brotherhood to order the first order of business being the bringing about of the downfall of our founder let us stop squabbling among ourselves over favors from the founder a part of our task is to bring about the early demise of great white fatherism we are not racists ours is a struggle to the death against racism so now it is time for us club members africans and africanamericans to cease looking at ourselves and at each other through the jaundiced eyes of the western world which is psychologically white and which looks with illconcealed contempt upon all the members of the brotherhood all the darker peoples who dwell upon this earth the thing that struck me most sharply about the statements written by john a williams and thomas echewa in negro digest on the question of africans and afroamericans was that all three articles read like they had been written by nonclub members of european descent and if not certainly by white men masquerading in the skins of blacks both williams and echewas statements remained most of the time on a highly superficial level as they recorded loads and loads of surface truths and halftruths and numerous irrelevancies which would hardly seem to have much bearing on the fundamental question facing our relationship because this question has nothing at all to do with how africans drink cognac or conduct themselves at bourgeois parties or the boisterousness of the lowerclass negro americans what is the fundamental question the thing is that afroamericans and africans have a common heritage which is africa which had a history thousands of years before the white man discovered it western man works from the proposition that history and civilization began for any corner of the earth at the moment it is discovered by the white man hence the myth that columbus discovered america even though there were people here when the man arrived but you werent discovered you know until mister charles got around to you get the picture you just existed in a kind of limbo in africa and in asia and on the islands of the seas waiting for the man to loom up over the horizon so that history and civilization could begin for you you noble savage you instead of waiting for godot or lefty you waited patiently for whitey let us also stress the fact that afroamericans and africans have a community of experiences visavis the white man it is the community of oppression cruel inhuman racist exploitation slavery and segregation and discrimination on this side of the atlantic at the journeys end colonialism and the slave trade at the genesis in mother africa where man first walked straight and upright on both sides of the ocean the impact on our personalities on our manhood on our selfhood was total if the impact on the african personality was less in its totality than the impact on the afroamerican it was merely a question of degree the fact of the matter is in both cases we still very often seek human dignity and pride in all the wrong places we seek dignity in the eyes of whitey who deprived us of it in the first instance but the slave master can never endow dignity upon the slave nor can the colonial master endow more than a superficial dignity upon the socalled native he who looks for dignity from his master is a fool it is up to the slave and the native to affirm their own dignity all else is false pride and vainglorious stupidity all else is gunga din and uncle tom and mister johnson let us cite a few examples of the whiteness of these learned essays on african and afroamerican relations mr echewa says in my opinion any white who is willing to entertain an african in his home could hardly be accused of negrophobia and further there is of course the story told of an african who sat beside a white couple in church the couple got up and moved to another pew after the service they came to the boy to apologize they had discovered that he was an african they even invited him to dinner in their home but the incident would seem to disprove his proposition that any white person who entertained an african could not be a negrophobe the real question here is did the african accept the invitation certainly what the white couple was saying in effect was you african blacks are all right its just the american niggers we cant stomach if the african did indeed accept the invitation one can only comment that it would seem that his dignity lies in another direction for example some african diplomats visited atlanta georgia not too long ago to observe the american way of free elections it seems that a ghana diplomat went innocently into one of the election booths and got roughed up by the evervigilant atlanta police you see they had mistaken him for an american citizen a faux pas of enormous proportions and of course upon discovering their grave and international error the city fathers hastened to apologize but the african brother said if there is any apology due at all it is due to the black people who live here in atlanta and to whom it happens every day brothers and sisters this is dignity believe me this is in the spirit of the brotherhood of blackness that when you deny the least of us you deny us all john a williams says    there is nothing like a trip to africa to make an american negro realize just how american he is    of course this is not the essential feeling of some negro americans who have made the trip i imagine it depends on what your values are what you go to africa looking for if you go to africa looking for a replica of the west if you look at africa out of tired cynical western eyes better known these days as white objectivity then you are bound to feel estrangement but if you go there for a new dialogue of values convinced that the values you left behind you in the west are fake and phony and deathly sick then you will have a different feeling about your experience the other thing is some black americans when they go to africa go there with whiter attitudes than those of white americans they are whiter than white americans in much the same way that some excolonial africans are more french than the french and more british than the british john a williams gratuitous comment on his feeling of extreme americanness is a case of unadulterated superpatriotism and shameless flagwaving of the american legion variety and is at one with the gunga din uncle tom bit that floyd patterson pulled when he had the extreme bad taste to bring religion into his battle of words with cassius clay the champ i mean the bit that he was fighting clay again to win the championship back for america as if clay were unamerican because he chose to be called muhammad ali does not floyd know that one of the founding principles of this republic was religious freedom but here we had the roles clearly and classically defined muhammad ali was the sassy arrogant nigger too big for his britches and poor floyd was the new white hope who had assumed the very tough assignment to cut the nigger down to size  also went to africa  did not need the trip to africa to realize how american  was the negro is the most american of americans with the possible exceptions of the socalled indians i knew i was american to begin with very american most american notwithstanding i did not go to africa looking for america  went to africa looking for africa and found her in all her wondrous mysterious magnificent diversity for africa is many different things and many different peoples in the summer and fall of  arrived in lagos the capital of nigeria and drove in a land rover  miles over the african countryside we drove from lagos to ibadan capital of the western region then to historic benin city then to asaba where i first glimpsed the great river niger and crossed on a ferry to onitsha then on to enugu the capital of the eastern region leaving enugu we traveled deep into the niger delta at port harcourt and bonny and calibar from there we came back to enugu and then followed the niger river hundreds of miles all the way to the ancient city of timbuktu the terrain changing before our eyes from the awesomely beautiful mangroves in the gulf of guinea at the edge of the continent to the delta region to the gorgeous lush rain forest to savanna land to the backdoor of the great sahara and the people we were in  african countries and everywhere i went people called me brother welcome american brother  shall never forget the evening i arrived at margaret ekpos home in aba in the eastern region of nigeria i had driven there with martin leighton a tall rugged friendly bbctype britisher mrs ekpo is a nigerian champion of the cause of womens rights and sits in the house of chiefs of the eastern region she had expected us and had invited some young nigerian politicians to her home to meet us when we martin and i were introduced to them they surged toward me and shook my hand and embraced me and said almost in unison welcome american brother martin stood there beside me invisible and unnoticed growing paler by the second mrs ekpo gestured to her constituents that i was not the only visitor and suddenly they turned embarrassed to martin leighton and said oh yes welcome friend i had many similar experiences whether i was in the crowded cities or in what the british call the bush and i had no need to hang out with englishmen or americans in order to get an orientation as to what africans are like i had not come to africa for that john a williams tells us further that americans and britishers accuse the nigerians of the habit of mixing good cognac with ginger ale a valid complaint according to mr williams presumably this was called to our attention to prove that nigerians were crude in the extreme and unsophisticated maybe even just downright uncivilized on the contrary all it really demonstrated was the shallowness of my american brothers thinking it exposed moreover a terribly brainwashed naivete since when did the matter of how one mixes ones whiskey become a gauge of the degree of civilization of a people as a distinguished writer we expected mr williams to give words newer deeper meanings mr echewa of nigeria seems to say that the afroamerican whom the visiting africans really hold in deep disdain is the lower class negro whatever the phrase encompasses in any event if it were true that stateside africans are disdainful of the lower class negro if we understand the implications of the phrase this great disdain would include the vast majority of our nations black population which would be to say that generally speaking visiting africans are disdainful of the american negro because williams optimism notwithstanding the vast majority of american negroes live out their lives in that lower class category and have never even walked across a college campus in another burst of optimism mr williams says but since the american society from the s has been mostly concerned with social changes or progress it seems inevitable that before long power will be shared by black americans this is the most incredible interpretation of the last  years in my country that i have ever come across and by a black american i mean where has the brother been all statistics available point to a very different development even the federal governments own statistics which are usually overly optimistic point to an alarmingly growing gap between the income of the negro people and the income of the nation as a whole and income is precisely where the power is at and power is never shared power is taken as per usual the great frederick douglass was right power concedes nothing without a demand it never did it never will one other thing i believe john a williams to be speaking for a very small minority of negroes including himself perhaps when he states that many negroes were jealous of africans achieving their independence i think most negroes reacted if at all very sensibly with pride and a deep sense of identification with their african brothers the thing for africans and afroamericans to understand it seems to me is that just as there was a community of oppression at the hands of whitey the difference in degree and in the style and structure of the oppression notwithstanding there is also a community of objectives in this brotherhood of blackness in this fellowship of the damned the disinherited the community of objectives is a mutual determination to throw off the black mans burden all over this whiteoriented earth let us face a few cruel indisputable facts there is no need or place for arrogance between us members of the brotherhood africa is not free and independent yet and neither is the american negro news coming out of that turbulent continent tells us every day that european presence is still a fundamental reality particularly in the economic sphere but also politically coups and rumors of coups reflect the grim reality of a european omnipresence playing its centuriesold game of divide and conquer repeat there is no need for arrogance between us duespaying club members of the brotherhood but there is a crying need for understanding fundamental understanding that we members of the brotherhood will stand or fall together that when the prestige of africa rises the prestige of black men rises all over the earth yes even in america and that every blow the black man in america strikes for his freedom is a blow for freedom over the length and breadth of this wonderful and terrible earth africans afroamericans we can not run away from each other even if we wanted to obviously some of us engage in such wistful thinking and work out our frustrations in pathetic acts of wish fulfillment but we wear the badge of our oppression in the color of our skin we are chained together the yoke is on our mutual backs the pain still throbs the scars still show physically psychologically politically socially economically let us stop fighting one another its time to put an end to this petty wrangling like dogs around the masters table snapping at each other in one pathetic scramble for the scraps the master throws at us vying with each other to see who licks the masters hand and gets a fond pat on the head let us rather emphasize the fundamental things which keep the brotherhood together and forge a unity from johannesburg south africa to jackson mississippi to throw off the black mans burden it is left up to us to make this the freedom century it is up to us to forge a unity of our minds and muscles dedicated to the proposition that we shall lay this burden down and free all mankind everywhere
it was march   and it was cold in  boston a group of men left a tavern encountered some british redcoats and shots were fired the first to die was a man named crispus attucks he was a black man this incident was later called the boston massacre and dates the beginning of the american revolution attucks death then started the american revolution but attucks himself didnt really see himself as a revolutionary like so many other men of that day he merely wanted change but faced with obstinance and resistance of a most determined nature revolution was the only course attucks later became something of a hero for negroes despite the fact that he was not acting in a negro cause but rather in a capacity of a citizen agitating for his rights in his office in the state house of massachusetts state attorney general edward w brooke is only a few blocks away from the actual scene of the boston massacre and closer still to the graves of attucks and the men who died with him that night it would appear that brooke will in many ways be a th century attucksa reluctant revolutionary edward w brooke says he is a man who would like to do his job as just another american public servant but there are several factors which prevent this first he is a gifted and dedicated administrator second he is eminently successful as a public servant third he is politically ambitious and fourth he is a negro these elements combined with his republican party membership have set the stage for him to help bring about a revolution that he really wishes wasnt necessary there are several unsettled factors which bear upon the revolution mr brooke is about to help launch perhaps the most important one is his successfully campaigning this fall for the u s senate seat vacated by leverett saltonstall it is generally felt however that he will be the next u s senator from massachusetts for three reasons brooke campaigned on a paltry budget for the attorney generals office of massachusetts in  and won he won because the voters of massachusetts had reached the point where they felt that anybody who promised to clean up the corruption in massachusetts was worth a try then he was a republican in a normally democratic state and negro to boot in  the voters returned brooke to office with the largest plurality of any republican in the u s and in doing so they gave him the greatest plurality ever achieved by a republican in massachusetts the reason for this is  that edward brooke diligently kept his campaign promises and prosecuted those his office found guilty of corruption while holding public office he was no respector of party lines trying republican and democrats as he found them the result was the people of massachusetts have a great deal of confidence in their attorney general as a man who has integrity intelligence and their best interests at heart this explains the first reason given why edward brooke might well become the next u s senator from massachusetts for as it was expressed by a cab driver he did a damned good job the office of the attorney general of massachusetts is decorated in soft muted tones of blue they are distinctly masculine but obviously chosen with taste there is a very strong suggestion of warmth and cordiality with an unrelenting undertone of efficiency and businesslike feel to the office to a very great degree the office reflects the personality and character of the man himself moreover mr brooke is the kind of individual who has the power of projection he is able to put across the kinds of fine touches that are looked for in men but he does so with such ease that the result is confidence in the strength and sincerity of the man as one might expect he is very well tailored in clothes whose colors and cuts impute stability and taste he is a handsome man and in these days when politicians must look good he easily falls into the part with his clean facial features and hair thats attractively greying at the temples he has a look of quiet assurance about him that many men who know what theyre about have the above notwithstanding and perhaps because of it the second most important reason for his probable victory next fall is the fact that he has charisma he has the capacity to excite people upon contact he can communicate with people but in addition he has the talent for doing so at the level and manner in which they seek to be reached he has that indefinable quality that carries a special message for individuals despite the fact that he may meet them in group circumstances in this age of mechanical mass communication he still does a great deal of campaigning in person but in person or not he still projects that feeling to an audience that he holds the key or answer to whatever it is that they are looking for in a leader the third reason he stands a very good chance of winning in the fall is the fact that he is a negro mr brooke has stated that he feels the race issue has neither helped him nor hindered him he wants to be judged on his personal merits as a public office holder and not for the color of his skin despite his genuine wishes on the matter his race is not going to be overlooked and the voters of massachusetts will have his race in mind when they vote massachusetts takes middleclass pride in the fact that it was liberal enough to elect a negro attorney general but this feeling of pride is further compounded because massachusetts has come in  for its share of negative publicity on the civil_rights score and scores of massachusettsians are righteously anxious to overcome this stigma further theres nothing more boastful than a white middleclassed american who has taken a negro to his bosom some of my best friends are negroes if the negro turns out to be exceptional this attitude is merely more intense to a great extent this is one kind of feeling that brooke will be facing in predominantly middleclass massachusetts he is the proof of the liberalism and intelligence of the electorate of massachusetts while at the same time he has also freed their consciences and it is likely they will want to ride the crest of this racial euphora to the limits if it appears from the above that mr brooke will walk into the u s senate without any opposition then its time to point out that some of the points mentioned above breed opposition in investigating and prosecuting graft impartially he has made enemies inside and outside of his partysome having considerable influence it is likely that the democrats will run the mayor of boston john collins who is reputed to be a tough campaigner and is a known vote getter he is confined to a wheelchair and this can have advantages for him similar to inherent advantages in brookes color but should brooke win the stage is then set for something of a revolution in american politics for the past thirtythree years or so the republicans have been losing political strength eisenhower was elected on his own popularity and personality rather than as a party candidate and for the exception of his two terms the democrats have held the presidency since roosevelt one of the major causes of this is the fact that the republican party has virtually ignored the immigrant and minority population of the major cities its a political fact of life that there are certain states with their large electoral vote count that a party must carry in order to win a national election these very same states have as the basis of their large vote count large numbers of immigrant and minority groups the republicans in ignoring these people have isolated and insulated themselves from the people who provide the political pivot in any nationwide campaign the republicans have become identified with money and not men there are many old guard republicans who prefer it like this to them the party is a collection of select clubs that get together every four years to propose a candidate these are the men according to brooke    who would rather lose the ball game just as long as they decide who is going to pitch it is because of this adamant and arbitrary position taken by the more conservative brooke calls them pseudoconservative leaders of the party that men like brooke lindsay romney and others are seeking a change but changes wont come easy and in fact a revolution will be necessary within the republican party before the needed change will take place reluctant as he might be to take on the power elite within the party as much as he wishes it was not imperative brooke will play a most strategic and vital role in the revolution there are many negroes who are wisely afraid they will be taken for granted by the democrats and thus lose their effectiveness as a voting block the voting statistics of  bear this concern out in some cases the democrats rolled up percentages in negro precincts of over   on the whole the percentages were well over  because of the position and policies of the republican party many black people felt they had no choice but to vote democratic essentially what this does to the negro is to mitigate and dilute his political influence at a time when he is aware that civil_rights and other things he wants are wrapped up in his strength at the ballot bax there are some negro republican leaders around the country who have been watching this development and are just waiting and hoping for the time when the national republican party can produce a platform and attitude that negroes can support recently a republican leader in memphis told this writer man we been catching hell here lately but colored folks are getting just a little bit afraid the democrats figure they got the all them sewed up if you want to see some real fireworks let guys like lindsay start setting policy with a policy consistent with lindsays views there are negro republicans who now hold office who could provide the rallying point for negroes coming back to the party of lincoln the mayor of springfield ohio robert c henry is one he represents the new breed of negro republican who is genuinely interested and informed about local and national issues he is a republican and proud of it but adds not the goldwater type but the real trump card is edward brooke brooke steadfastly maintains that he doesnt want to be known as a negro leader he wants to be evaluated as a man but he also knows that the title of negro leader will fall to him if he becomes a u s senator if this title helps to rebuild the party along more realistic and liberal lines as it inevitably will then he is for it because he is a party man as a man he believes in civil_rights for everyone as a republican he believes in the future of his party as a negro he believes in his right to be a man and a republican without any special attention focused upon him because of his race the role of the revolutionary has been thrust at brooke because much of what he wants as a man a citizen and republican are denied because of the defeatist policies of the ruling circle of his party because he is ambitious intelligent and seems to have history on his side it is likely that he will emerge a winner but win or not his role as a leader in the attucks tradition is already assured thats victory enough for any man
the preponderance of educational literature leans toward drastically revising or discarding the grade system they be analyzed in social class and selfconcept or social class and achievement most economically disadvantaged negroes fare poorly in our traditional graded education system tragically a vast majority of innovations placed into the grade system like the first old new england bridges covered with deep snow collapse from the weight of entrenched obsolescence causes of failure despite the fact that educators continually seek to develop school programs which will retain all youth until they graduate from high school approximately onethird of our nations population drop out of school as early as their respective local laws permit equally as alarming is the united states department of labor   study entitled school and early employment experience which concluded that adverse school experience was the major reason given for dropping out this observation has been borne out by numerous other studies dropping out of school is an effect and not a cause of school failures there are many reasons why students fail to keep up in grade assignments foremost is the difference in sexual readiness where girls achieve academic maturity earlier than boys if we add other physiological and social differences especially ethnic to the personality matrix it becomes apparent that our concepts of normal students should be reevaluated certainly if as many social practitioners suggest negroes as a whole are even more disadvantaged than white students then it seems educationally unsound to expect such disadvantaged or deprived students to fit a traditional normal student mold while all of those who drop out of school do not reflect poverty backgrounds a disproportionately large number of dropouts are negro students who come from povertystricken homes school is no less painful for a majority of the lowerincome negro students who do not drop out those who stay in school realize that dropping out only accelerates their reaching a fulltime unproductive life leading to social oblivion why they might ask should a person drop out of school and into unemployment for which is hotterthe academic frying pan or the unemployment fire many educators are aware of the weaknesses in the grade system and have tried new techniques to educate socially and economically disadvantaged students but alas our formal educational road to failure is replete with good intentions to improve the traditional system john goodlad a renowned educator surmises that interest ability and other special groups within graded systems do not significantly expedite the learning advantages found in nongraded schools a primary reason for the relative ineffectiveness of modified grade systems is their builtin curricular rigidity other innovations in the grade system have taken on the forms of field visits recreational programs and tutoring in their efforts to correct program deficiencies many traditional schools have undergone processes closely resembling neighborhood conservation activities in an urban renewal program they have sought to conserve the best of the existing system and to abolish any outmoded portions and like neighborhood conservation these efforts merely delay the time before complete redevelopment must take place current studies further indicate that schools which are based upon grades do not usually enhance the selfconcepts of low achieving negro students it seems that the elements of standard curricula and periodic grading guarantee a greater percentage of students who will have negative feelings of their self worth each year thousands and thousands of negro students leave school believing that they cannot succeed in middleclass competition to prove their point they display report cards which are liberally decorated with failing or nearfailing grades some critics of the grade system maintain that such a rigid system cannot satisfactorily provide culturally disadvantaged students with adequate visual and auditory perception or language and speech patterns in our lockstep grade system the criticism continues lowerincome negro students drop further and further behind experience less and less success until they earn the titles of underachievers slow learners and poor readers their inability to succeed in the grade system perpetutes cultures of poverty so why not try nongraded education when grading is dropped criticizing the grade system john goodlad and robert anderson authors of the nongraded elementary school wrote first a certain amount of progress is held standard for a years work then the content of the work is laid out within the grade to be covered and to a degree mastered the slow are pulled and stretched to fit the grade sometimes because their godgiven limbs lack enough elasticity they are nonpromoted left behind where presumably another year of stretching will do the trick as for the gifted students the authors conclude that they are compressed and contracted to fit the grade in time they learn to adapt to a pace that is slower than their natural one by  at least  states had one or more communities experimenting with nongraded education the earliest primary unit elementary schools were given many names including the primary schools of green bay wisconsin wichita kansas provo utah the junior primary unit at dale mabry elementary tampa florida the ungraded primary in corona california unified school district and the primary unit plan at marblehead massachusetts the first high schools to try nongrading were the melbourne nova and satellite high schools all of florida chippewa valley high school mt clemens michigan and middletown high school in rhode island which became the first completely nongraded six year secondary school in  unlike the grade structure the nongraded structure is based upon the premises that a year of school life depending upon the student may mean much more or much less than a year of progress in a subject area a students progress is not seen as being unifiedhe may spurt ahead in one subject area and lag behind in another adequacy of a students progress is determined by comparing a students attainment to his ability learning is viewed vertically or longitudinally rather than horizontally slow progress is provided for by allowing the student a longer time to do given blocks of work thereby minimizing failures rapid progress is provided for by encouraging bright students to move ahead without regard to a grade label finally the flexibility in programming allows for easier implementation of curriculum improvements by individualizing the curriculum nongraded schools seek to abolish failure as an educational concept they also seek to accentuate success of course not all students will be successful in achieving their academic goals but their attempts are placed within a proper achievementability content several studies indicate that nongraded schools are more effective than graded schools in raising a students selfesteem and maintaining it at a high level even after unsuccessful task efforts  despite positive evaluation the larger school systems remain curious but cautious about nongrading chicago and detroit public schools for example have only recently decided to try nongrading on a limited basis at the elementary level however most large school systems appear to be neither curious nor cautious and are clinging to their graded programs in addition to its limited use and evaluation in large urban schools the foremost disadvantages of the nongraded system are report cards and community reluctance nongraded schools have not found an optimum solution to the marking problem they are still trying to design report cards that will properly reflect how the students level of achievement compares with others in the system how the student stands in relation to his own ability and how the student compares with others in the group perhaps the foremost disadvantage of the nongraded system is the fact that it deviates from current educational practices severing the umbilical cord of traditionalism is sometimes disastrous to break through the comforts associated with the status quo and to bring about change causes a cry from most individuals who have conceived and nurtured the graded system in chicago and detroit for example when first introduced many parents claimed that they could not understand the basic philosophy of nongraded schools teachers threw up their arms in despair at being trained to teach in such a system educators of teachers were slow to advocate methods or philosophy of nongrading and taxpayers resented the use of public funds to experiment with their youth but beneath the vocal din and scholastic subterfuge is the fear of the unknown most americans do not mind jumping on a bandwagon if it is moving few school districts want to be the pilot or experiment to test the merits of nongrading in almost the same tone as the antinegro question of would you want your daughter to marry one community leaders study nongraded plans and look at each other asking would you want your child to attend one the better bridge builders as a bit of academic hindsight it seems easier for a social practitioner to criticize an existing educational institution than to objectively analyze it and then if needed offer practical alternatives for achieving more effectiveness it is even more difficult for him to criticize his stated alternatives the latter task is psychologically disconcerting it highlights the gaps between social theory and social practice and equally important it reminds the social practitioner of his own inadequacies yet of all the changeagents action researchers or social engineers have built the sturdiest bridges between social theory and social practice bridging the gap between educational theory and practice requires a knowledge of the past an appreciation for the present and a projected awareness of the future to state merely that our school system should shift from graded programs to nongraded programs is to overestimate the value of nongraded programs and to underestimate the value of graded programs nongraded schools should not be viewed as being completely new bridges for socializing students but instead as being significantly improved bridges there was a time when vocational training remedial classes and cultural enrichment programs were called drastically new approaches to formal education quickly and correctly educators reminded us that these innovations evolved out of an existing system when viewed in this manner education is in a continual state of change thus nongraded schools become a means to better education and not better education in itself traditional education some critics claim is not even adequate for traditional or normal students therefore when forced to educate nontraditional students such as lowerincome negro students the graded system shakes as if beseiged with delirium tremens following an examination of the system its custodians fail to provide it with the much needed corrective surgery which according to most studies would kill the system in the meantime the system continues to hobble along causing students to drop out or to graduate without inculcating needed basic skills gradually cases are being made to declare the graded system educationally incompetent in addition the taxpayers are being asked to give educators the power of attorney to commit it to the past in hearing the testimony local communities must decide if the graded system is guilty and must be put away for the good of society or if it is not guilty and can continue its efforts to socialize students if the verdict is guilty counsel for the defense of graded schools probably will ask for a suspended sentence and an opportunity to undergo rehabilitation treatments social scientists and educators speaking as amicus curiae do not recommend trying to rehabilitate the graded schools their evidence leans heavily towards implementing nongraded programs with deliberate speed the diversified needs of all students particularly the povertystricken call for this greatly improved approach to education yet it is a reality of community organization that it will take a while before many communities accept and commit resources to nongraded schools in the interim period the students suffer an even more sobering conclusion was drawn by august kerber and wilfred smith in educational issues in a changing society if we were to imagine the traditional school system as a personalization we would find an old man with a heavy load suffering  and creaking at the joints harassed by spectators and even wellwishers at all sides and confused by opposing bits of advice this of course is an oversimplification yet even the ideal school system in our society is filled with all kinds of problems the strange fact is that education manages to keep going summary since our culturally disadvantaged students must compete in a basically middleclass oriented society they should be prepared for such competition few educators will disagree with this premise the major disagreement comes out of a quest for the best means of educating disadvantaged students there are those who would argue that nongraded schools are artificial systems which merely delay the time when the disadvantaged student will compete in a lifelike situation following this line of reasoning nongraded schools are both pretentious and dysfunctional for middleclass survival but perhaps the most frequent argument against nongraded education is that disadvantaged children do not need special curricula only more of the traditional curricula and for a longer period of time on the other hand reminiscent of a political slogan a few educators are beginning to chant that it is time for a change like alice in wonderland they are beginning to realize that culturally disadvantaged students must keep running just to keep up the changes most frequently suggested are those which would bend or break the grade lockstep by providing for students who need special assistance in small classes who need more emphasis on basic skills who have average ability and who are above average nongraded proponents believe that their system is best suited for meeting societal and individual needs despite its merits the nongraded system has flaws the basic issue then becomes can we as a nation afford not to try new approaches to education which may allow disadvantaged students to enter the mainstream of democratic life if the answer is no then we should encourage our school boards to give nongrading a fair trial and evaluation
in all the analyses postmortems and search for causes conducted in los angeles after the watts riots there has been a solid reluctance to admit that the local events foretell changes for the negro in america the attempt to explain that violence entirely in terms of local conditions not only ignores changes within the national negro community but actually obstructs a real understanding of those changes the watts riots represent a marked and obvious shift in attitude among negroes in los angeles and given the recent history of the negro it follows that from los angeles there stem national implications thus it becomes immaterial whether watts is or is not a slum area whether criminal elements were or were not responsible for the rioting or whether police brutality did or did not occur the important thing is how negroes are beginning to regard what they at least see as facts and this new attitude is by no means confined to los angeles the change is based on shifts in the negros overall power position from the expanded use of the vote has come political power the negro has made his purchasing power felt in certain locales and his consumption pattern has affected the national market in some key commodities and the unrelenting civil_rights movement has brought domestic advances in the negros broad social position in addition to moral advantages acquired through a sympathetic world opinion as a result he is learning about the rewards of bargaining in the american way of life but the favorable shifts in the negros position have given him only a taste of the tangy flavor of power wielding its weaponsthe vote boycotts nonviolent demonstrationshe glimpses an even larger arsenal of possible weapons these alternative weapons and strategies increase his bargaining position if he can make violence work as an alternative to peaceful demonstration he seems willing to try it the northern parallel of the negroes with guns experiment in north carolina louisiana and mississippi showed itself in watts last august where peaceful weapons do not operate violence is an alternative and though this may come as a surprise to a public almost surfeited with reports of victory in the war for civil_rights the peaceful weapons were doing little for watts i came home to watts after two years abroad a week before the riots began during the years away i had read much about the quickening pace of the civil_rights movement and upon my return i was eager to see what changes had been made i was soon let down the dismal sameness of the neighborhood disturbed me most watts had not a new building the community issues which were old two years ago were now traditional police brutality was still alleged by a persistent few and just as emphatically denied by an official few on first appearance it seemed not only that watts had been spectator to whatever impact the civil_rights movement was making on the negro community but also that it did not in the slightest share the dazzling growth of the los angeles area watts seemed passive neither swinging with the new progressive ethos of the civil_rights movement nor enriching itself by way of the southern california bonanza it was i thought the same watts i had known as a boy to grow up in watts then was to have no especial pride in the community it was a physical locale and a habit of thought that one was expected to outgrow local heroes moved away went to the westside and seldom were heard from again when i graduated from high school and was preparing to leave for college my advisers told me that if people asked where i was from i should say south los angeles not watts anyone aspiring to success in the outside world was expected to dissociate himself from watts nothing good was ever known of watts it was in the news only as the scene of a knifing or shooting and in watts no boyhood dream was complete unless it included some kind of deliverance from the burdensome stigma the important differences between that old watts and the watts of today began to emerge for me during a conversation before the riots with a high school classmate who had preceded me to college we had always thought alike but now after the intervening years we seemed separated by our different experiences he talked about conditions in the city for afroamericans as he called negroes and said that he thought there were more important things than a home and fine car he was concerned that i should always remember my beginnings in watts and reminded me of his own experiences after college though a successful student he was never hired in the field of his academic specialty disappointed he joined the army and there suffered an injury that has left him slightly crippled soon after the injury he was discharged and later he married he is still jobless the ordeal has left him embittered at one time active in the civil_rights movement he now pays it little attention most of his friendly relations with white civil_rights workers have been severed he is indifferent to integration yet matters having to do with race interest him now even more than they did two years ago what now concerns him is the selfsufficiency of the negro community after the riots he called to express his satisfaction but regretted that the riots had stopped too short the true history of watts is the evolution of a negro community and it thus makes better sense to discuss the los angeles riots within the context of the negro in america than as a part of the civil_rights movement for watts like the larger community may be affected by the movement but it is nevertheless an entity apart from the movement it has absorbed some of the achievements of the drive for civil_rights and repelled others discarding the civil_rights framework in order to explain the riots may appear ironic but in fact the separation between the negro community and the civil_rights movement is easily discernible the real irony of the situation is that the successes of the movement are often mistakenly seen as satisfying some condition of the negro community when to the dismay of many the recent riots followed on the heels of the passage of the voting rights act the comment frequently made was you give these people this great piece of legislation and what do they do they go out and riot it doesnt make good sense but the civil_rights movement and the voting rights act are one thing the negro community and the riots are quite another hence the riots cannot be discussed in terms of the old language the cause advances setbacks cannot explain the changes
the riots introduced a new language it is hardly intelligible to anyone outside the negro community some evidences of the vocabulary of the new language can be gleaned from the tone of current negro literature the fire hi ext time negroes with guns are recent titles that have meaning in the new context the language is bitter and it smacks of desperate conduct and action yet even worse the nations ear is not trained to recognize it for the first time los angeles heard from a littleknown black man a kind of gnome he was a recluse in watts a negro qua negro silent invisible and until now always passive most of the time he has been the object of somebody elses action relentlessly acted upon when he met whites they were usually in a uniformthat of a policeman or a businessmansignifying some role antagonistic to the community it was no accident that the riots chose the police and the merchants as their targets initially it was an incident with policemen that provoked the riots but the policemans presence is always at issue he comes to the negro community to impose a legal order so incompatible with its style of life and patterns of conduct as to make it seem that he is imposing an alien civil code the charge often made that protests against police brutality are just a convenient cover up for a prevailing civic irresponsibility ignores the fact that the law and its agents reflect the dominant american mode of life and that the negro as a community is excluded from fully participating in that dominant mode so the law that appears to be a form of order for the largest sectors of the population is in fact an inconvenience and a burden when applied to negroes unlike the policeman whose presence is constant the merchant confines his activities in watts to business hours the merchant was damned not so much for his unethical dealingsto be sure the merchants are no more unethical in watts than they are anywhere elsebut ironically enough for his strict application of the american business ethic to watts in particular watts has been made an exception to the rules of the larger community but few allowances for the difference are ever made with respect to business it is hardly recognized that business practices appropriate to wilshire beverly hills and other sections of los angeles are in nowise suitable to watts the merchant righteously tells his customer in watts that his treatment is no different from the treatment of customers at the store across town the fallacy in this pitch to the negro customer is so obvious that it rarely goes unnoticed if the merchant is to do business in watts the terms of his relationship with the customer must be keyed to the individual pocketbooks of the local citizens examples abound in watts of goods being reclaimed and payroll checks being attached after a customer has failed on a single monthly payment negroes recognize the subtle alternating pattern of partiality with impartiality and they talk about it the watts riots were an assertion in still another direction in addition to expelling the white presence they created and exposed new reactions of the negro to himself the traditional roles were switched the negro was in the active role for the first time doing the chasing and wreaking the havoc to a people who have always been acted upon rarely doing anything for itself or to communities outside the riots were a bold departure from a long tradition of inertia admittedly the fact that the activity was destructive is not irrelevant but it is less important than the fact that rioting is for the negro in watts a form of expression no one understands his problem or bothers to care few of his local leaders have the imagination or vision to articulate his special feelings to the outside world besides it is the kind of story most americans will protest that they would rather not hear there in watts the negro is trapped and without a means of expressing himself or of making himself understood to the environment that surrounds him because of the inadequacy of the avenues open to him he resorts in desperation to rioting what seemed like a sudden reaction to his plight had in fact been developing in the negro all along it was sudden only in its manifestation by his relegation to watts the negro is forced to be conscious of the differences that place him there the isolation serves to accentuate his awareness of his homogeneity and it follows from this that the negro resolves most of the differences that relegate and isolate him into one unique differencethat of race to this race consciousness the negro attaches many thingsthe sum of his reactions to this world we all live in and to himself as the world about us changes to be sure the reactions he derives from this race consciousness are not consistently rational but then what human reactions are consistently rational to be a negro and aware of its serves as an organizing mechanism that simplifies many things for him explains why certain other things happen just to him and no one else and gives to him a justification not only for reacting differently but for acting differently as well the importance of the los angeles riots lies in the fact that it was the first time in watts that race consciousness has been a basis for acting previously the consciousness had been present but always passive it was a basis solely for understanding what was done to the negro on racial grounds what minuscule action race consciousness did take as in organizations that adhered to racist doctrines was more important as reaction to the black mans special predicament on most busy street corners in the neighborhood one could buy a paper and read about the negros new and growing awareness of himself but for the most part it was confined to newsprint and the muslim temple that it has now exploded in racial violence only reinforces and heightens the race consciousness the attempt to dispel it comes too late while the rioting lasted it divided the city into two very obvious camps but the intense race consciousness that was manifested during the riots has not been erased now that the riots have ended it lives on in internalized forms in new images and new possibilities there is a tragedy in the new prospect it is sure to make future relations between the negro community and the city somewhat strained at a time when both communities could profit by increased understanding of each other the distance that separated whites from negroes before the riots is even greater today the very understanding the negro solicits by rioting is barred by the effects of that rioting in an attempt to explode myths he has only magnified them by resorting to violence that traditional mode of human expression he has made future expression and communication more difficult the problem of communication is not new indeed the aftermath of the rioting showed how vast the communication gap has always been for one thing the news media lacked proper resources one of the major metropolitan dailies had to hire its negro advertising agent to cover the area because it had no negroes on the reporting staff a national magazine with offices in los angeles nevertheless had no coverage for two full days because there was no one in the local office who could enter the riot area also the news media were wholly without the experience to deal with the negro population after the riots had ended watts was practically overrun by press tv and radio in search of the facts but these media could find no reliable sources of information it was apparent that most of the reporters were going about the task of covering the riot area in total darkness the lack of facilities and techniques for communication may have added to the difficulties many of the published facts about the riots were not even approximately true most outsiders simply could not distinguish between forms the lack of experience with watts led to gross generalizing for example most officials outside concluded that there was no leadership in watts and this may be sufficient as far as the outside community is concerned but they fail to realize that the citizenry of watts is not a flock watts too is a community and therefore its leadership takes a variety of forms there are political leaders business leaders religious leaders et al whereas in the large community the leadership resides most often in business executives and professionals the same kind of leadership in watts falls to the barber the auto mechanic the bartender it is not so much that leadership does not exist but that the indigenous leadership takes forms which are largely unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the community pattern the same social factors that make the law seem alien and the business practices unfair can account for the outsiders failure to discover leadership in watts the problem in communication now is not so much a lack of interest in obtaining information it is rather one of dealing skillfully with an unfamiliar community    riots in los angeles and the threat of riots elsewhere should serve to remind the nation of the negros growing restlessness the sad facts of the los angeles story indicate that violence can easily occur in all the big cities of the north and the problems are exceedingly difficult for it is impossible to deal with the negro as though he were something other than himself to expect the negro to become white in his thinking is to expect too much understanding can proceed only if there is a firm recognition of genuine differences a failure to recognize the differences and to understand what they mean to the negro will inevitably lead to more riots 
the tragedy of the  rj r american negro is i t not at e s black in  jv a white mans country but rather its the fact that he is helplessly trapped in a fantasy land of torment and terror a land which persists in trying to control everyone everywhere but merely succeeds in corrupting and destroying everything it touches conceived in genocide and slavery and now dedicated to the proposition that its ordained mission is to rule the world or act as world policeman as the daily press so quaintly phrases it america has now marked itself the thug of the th century by its wanton murder of unarmed peoples in distant lands who hardly knew this country existed let alone had any intention of dropping one pebble on its soil and needless to say this criminal attitude of total disregard for the legal and human rights of other peoples is making the white american detested in every corner of the world then counterpoised to this public spectacle of escalating horror is the private chaos resulting from the vicious subterranean battle waged by americas brainwashed overeducated white women who are made to live in a state of virtual servitude by their insecure racehating warmongering men folk and caught beneath these eternally clashing forces the negro is like a man tied to a sinking ship who has the option of going down with everyone else or breaking his chains and leaping overboard into the unknown uncharted waters yet up till this very moment with but few exceptions our leaders have constantly told us we must prepare ourselves so we will be ready to move into the mainstream when the time is ripe and it is exactly at this point that they betray themselves and this brings us to the second tragic aspect of the afroamerican his leaders speak for the oppressor knowingly or otherwise we are never asked if we want to move into the mainstream for due to the incredibly egotistical nature of the white man he has always assumed that all black folk are simply champing at the bit waiting for that glorious day when his benign white brother will reach out his hand and say come i welcome you at ast into my promised land and this is why the late malcolm_x and the black muslims are so despised by white america malcolm and the muslims dared to say what an everincreasing number of afroamericans have long yearned to say the white man be damned i want no part of him and his evil ways for who indeed in his right mind wants to move into americas polluted mainstream where every man woman and child stand neck deep in some one elses blood the stench here is as stilling as any that ever came from a german concentration camp only the sound is muffled but let us suppose for a moment that we should consider following that lets get ready advice how do we prepare ourselves to enter the modern house of horror that is america today obviously and of utmost importance we must learn to forego the pleasures of petty thievery no more this business of grabbing a loaf of bread and a few ham hocks and running for which we always receive ten or fifteen years when caught and we are always apprehended we never benefit from any of that cant finditis luck which always seem to befall white folk when they have victimized us from here on in we must play it the way the mainstreamers do work out a system we must plan our deviltry with premeditation and in great complicated detail so we can abscond with millions a la the bank tellers the salad oil boys the billie sol estes the teapot domers the dixon yates the bobby bakers the five percenters and the price fixers etc then too we must stop all this tomfoolery of bushwhacking each other in the future we must band together and blow up their churches and sunday schools in session and play target practice with their passing motorists and lurk in the darkened bushes and shoot their unsuspecting men and women and children in the back and then we must be prepared to sit on hung juries so we can let us go free and then give ourselves our profound congratulations for being so so white and in addition to this subtle warfare at home we must now learn how to wage allout war on foreign soil in the name of peace and democracy the first and most urgent lesson to learn here is that we must accuse them of aggression while we test our flame throwers our napalm bombs and other horror weapons on their women and children and no matter how far from home we are or how many cities and villages we wreck or how many people we blow to bits we must always remember to shout in righteous indignation those people must be taught that we will not budge an inch until they learn how  to live in peace with their neighbors then when they have learned this lesson we will rebuild all their bridges all their hospitals and roads and villages and homes and schools and all their everything except the people we have incinerated but we mustnt let a little thing like that bother us because after all they werent like us you know and war is hell and besides look how it strengthened our economy another cardinal rule we must remember to adhere to at all times whether home or abroad is to bump off anybody we cant buy or anybody we no longer have any need of and then finally and foremost if we are ever to really make it big in the mainstream we must remember that at all times and at all costs we simply must keep the nigger down if you dont keep both feet on him day and night he will always take a little bit more and a little bit more until the next thing you know hes living next door and marrying our sister now that we have the magic formula for becoming a mainstreamer theres only one question left who is going to be our nigger but i should think the answer to that is as plain as day the black folk still stuck in the ghetto will be the black mainstreamers nigger of tomorrow to be sure more than one cani did observer of the american scene has noted that this nation has always been controlled by an elite group and never was this more true than it is today and obviously this elite group has historically been white males of anglosaxon origin the anglosaxon origin has given way somewhat under heavy pressure but the white male continues to rule this country in the same old fashion of granting preferential privilege to a select few and the overwhelming majority of white women in america are so brainwashed and so afraid that someone will label them masculine if they stop shouting the praises of their lifelong state of semivoluntary servitude to the male that they have become even more insistent than the white male that the nigger must be kept in his place imagine their consternation conscious or otherwise when they finally get the message that that equality business was meant for males white only that the female must remain a subservient subsidiary at all times and especially if she marries in which case she will even have to give up her own identity and follow the ageold slave custom of adopting the masters name and not only must she serve her husband hand and foot night and day but she must also loudly acclaim the neverending joy of such servitude now such a role may not be so onerous for some female who had trouble making it out of kindergarten but for these bright bas and phds who shout such rot nowadays its really not unlike watching a game of russian roulette unfolding for sooner or later the big game comes one such bang is the many mamas boys these bright serfs turn out which was so ably described in the feminine mystique by betty friedan some two years ago now the point where we are directly concerned in all this business is that so many of these inferior housewives vent their frustrations on the most convenient underdog they can find the afroamerican it isnt mere coincidence that in both the north and the south so many white women have made such tenacious efforts to keep the schools and neighborhoods segregated and just where did you think all those little old ladies in tennis shoes came from these insecure housewives realize all too clearly that if the negro gains his freedom they will be the only serfs left in this vast wasteland and in addition these same women having no life of their own inasmuch as they have been divested of their inalienable right to be free individuals rob their children and their husbands of their sense of self and peace of mind thus we see middleclass teenagers wrecking america in a far more prodigious manner than any black slum kid could ever hope to do and their fathers the men who rule the nation are so harried and unsure of themselves thanks to their dispossessed nagging women that not only are they dead set against ever letting the black man rise but these same men of power must constantly prove their manhood in any manner they can and usually in the easiest way by kicking the downtrodden further down for a grim example both arthur m schlesinger and theodore c sorensen have come up with sad afterthoughts concerning their part in the bay of pigs fiasco during john f kennedys presidency in his book a thousand days john f kennedy in the white house schlesinger called the invasion a terrible idea and reproached himself for not having protested more strenuously at the time while sorensen wrote in his book kennedy concerning that illfated episode that unfortunately among those privy to the plan in both the state department and the white house doubts were entertained but never pressed partly out of fear of being labeled soft or undaring in the eyes of their colleagues    and he went on to point out that kennedy too feared that cancellation of the invasion would make him look soft at home and abroad he felt that his disapproval of the plan would be a show of weakness inconsistent with his general stance    newsweek august   and one bright day these same insecure men or men like them are apt to find themselves in a situation involving the bomb and in order to save face and look strong they may just as casually blow up the world and wont those brainwashed white women be surprised when they find that after all these years of proclaiming my place is in the home the home is going to be the first place blasted off the map when americas bombs come to roost
idney poitier millions of people know that name it belongs to the only negro ever to win an academy award as a leading man in a hollywood motion picture that in itself is a pachydermatous accomplishment but even more it is a stupendous victory in the negros struggle for human justice poitier as any movie fan knows won his oscar for his outstanding portrayal of an itinerant worker for a group of poor foreign nuns in the film lilies of the field however there are those who claim that he was only good not great in the film and that he received the coveted award principally because of the times and not because of his talents they are dead wrong about his talent but they are right about the social climate it cannot be denied that the negro quest for civil_rights reached a pinnacle in  it also stands uncontradicted that in the sixtyodd years of cinema the images of negroes on screen have been changingfrom fools to comedians to integral characters and now heroic protagonists still there is much to be desired of all the negro actors and actresses in this country only a handful have been featured in integrated pictures and in those instances their roles have been limited to segregation themes it is to poitiers credit that he has somehow managed to cast off the psychological chains that bind negroes to certain ethnic parts in films his success quite possibly could revolutionize the entire movie making industry for the moment however hollywood continues to follow a policy of white makes right this absurdity is manifested either in flagrant racism or in the utter ignoring of the negros existence so much so the industry has been under constant attack from the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and the congress of racial equality core and as of late some of the big white stars themselves in addition numerous resolutions have been adopted calling for an  end to negro stereotyping as well as an end to discriminatory practices by the trade unions talent guilds and other agencies until  studios and producers for years had stalled the efforts of negroes to obtain a semblance of equal opportunity in hollywood each year there were meetings between the parties involved but nothing ever came of them a few jobs as extras opened up for some negroes in b movies but the craft unions continued their closed shop policy finally the naacp stepped in and vowed to boycott theatres all across the country if action was not taken immediately the moguls not wanting to be hit where it hurts the mostin the pocketbookbegan a frantic search for negro talent no longer were there scenes of city streets or subways where there was not a single negro in sight moreover two negroes wendell franklin and otis greene were picked off for executive posts on two major projects franklin served as an assistant director for the film the greatest story ever told still to be released and greene was an assistant to producer james fonda on screen gems hazel series the target show of the naacps demand for more movie jobs at the time greene was quoted as saying that work available to negro actors had increased tenfold and he was right only thats like saying that a firm with one negro on its staff which then hires an other has increased its negro personnel some  per cent discrimination is still a way of life in hollywood for instance there were  negroes listed by central casting corporation in  during all of  and the first part of  that figure was increased to the grand total of  central an agency of the motion picture producers association has  whites on its roles and  orientals in the craft unions a training program has been instituted for all apprentice aspirants regardless of race but according to a spokesman for mppa the program is in its infancy and has very few unions under its wing this has led the naacp to threaten decertification proceedings by appealing directly to the national labor relations board one such target is the international association of theatrical stage employes iatse with which the unions are affiliated meanwhile iatse steadfastly insists that it does not practice discrimination but produces no figures to prove it and so it goes hollywoods discrimination against negroes remains for the most part true to tradition compounded upon a premise which by its very nature is not only bad but normally unjust that premise is comprised of many parts including union discrimination the southern shuffle restrictions imposed by financiers and ignorance the southern shuffle perhaps more than any of the others is responsible for the negros plight where movies are concerned film after film following the turn of the century specialized in maligning ridiculing and disparaging the race not only were the true hopes and ambitions of the negro suppressed but the characterizations of negroes as given were the vilest of caricatures the most odious stereotypes purposely drawn to show the negro as a brainless idiot and how they succeeded howls of laughter were heard from movie houses when the characters rastus and sambo were introduced to the nation while the disfranchisement and segregation of the negro was carried out at the same time it was a hideous crime but like murder in mississippi and chicago too it went unsolved the trend of negro treatment on the screen took a sharp turn in the years between  and  unfortunately it wasnt for the best uncle tomism came into being then such trash as for massas sake in slavery days and the debt spewed from the soundless studios uncle toms cabin itself appeared during those years but instead of the scathing indictment of slavery that its author harriet beecher stowe wanted it to be the movie became a disgraceful display of subservient loyalty then came d w griffiths birth of a nation termed a classic by some it aided and abetted bigots who for obvious reasons saw fit to perpetuate hatred between negroes and whites a former president of the us woodrow wilson lauded the film and reportedly said it is like writing history with lighting the new york times said it is by far the greatest motion picture work yet put forward variety stated birth of a nation is a new milestone in film artistry    a great epoch in picture making but if the movie was a heavensent depiction to whites it was a hellridden falsehood to negroes nearly all viewed it as simply gross propaganda aimed at glorifying the outlawed and disgraced kukluxklan a storm of protest arose when the film was initially released and many theatres banned itfor a whilein several northern states yet the effectiveness of the picture is best seen by the fact that in  there were some  kkk members throughout the united states from that time until after the second world war the hollywood scene as related to the negro people remained just about the same but in  came a wave of darkie interest films the first fulllength production was a war vehicle entitled home of the brave it was followed by lost boundaries pinky and intruder in the dust while they did not lean towards uncle tomism and lowlife comedy as represented by willie best stepin fetchit and mantan moreland they nevertheless were symbols of segregation at the time that they were made there was not one negro writer producer director technical direc tor or camera man listed as a guild member what is even worse very few negroes resided in hollywood and they for the most part were maids and butlers as for a negro becoming a star well that was out of the question that is until poitier arrived whereas the studios would spend thousands upon thousands of dollars building the white actor or actress into a star they spent nothing on the negro personality obviously the star system was built on color and black was not the in color it is well to note that it was stanley kramer producer of home of the brave who added a touch of racial maturity to hollywood by casting poitier opposite tony curtis in the defiant ones the year was  and by then it had become politically possible to star a negro in an integrated movie still it would be five years later before poitier would be given a role which called for a top flight actor irrespective of race creed or color from all that has transpired since then it would seem that sidney has it made in movies this is hardly the case his roles will continue to be hand picked if for no other reason than miscegenation and for hollywood that is a dirty word out there race mixing is only for real lifenot the screen this malady is typified by the attitude towards the interracial movie one potato two potato turned down as a selection for the cannes film festival by the u s motion picture export association the producers of the movie larry peerce and jack weston had to visit a horde of european sources before they could get their work distributed in cannes a french selection committee readily agreed to show the film and it received widespread acclaim the female lead barbara barrie won the best actress award for her performance there potato told the story of a man who had left his wife and child to go to south america in his absence his wife divorced him returning four years later he discovered his wife had married a negro bernie hamilton so he sued for custody of the child contending that the child could not have a normal upbringing in an interracial marriage he won out of course this honest film was an independent production and thats hollywood today sidney poitier may be like a pair of brand new shoes to the movie colony but the same old feet are in them the movie industry remains like most of americas institutionsby for and about white people

an old propaganda adage is repetition is a form of emphasis in a very real sense we have been bombarded with the most emphatic kind of propaganda possible on harlema ghetto exceptionally prolific in inspiring writers sociologists pamphleteers etc gilbert osofsky joins this long line with harlem the making of a ghetto harper and row  he must be aware of the hordes of his predecessors because he has done an exceptional job of research and he must have felt that his book would make a contribution toward a better understanding of harlem in a sense his book does make a contribution it is one of the better documented works and reflects the kind of massive research he did making his collection of harlemtonia a scholars work much of the substance however is rather commonly known to negroes and to others who have any interest in harlem andor negro big city ghettos using certain problems he does show dramatically how little things have changed for example in  charles dickens visited the negro slums of new york and wrote women and men    slink off to sleep forcing the dislodged rats to move away we know that one of the principal fears today of the harlem mother is that her child will be bitten by rats during the night in  the new freeman stated the present housing conditions of the vast majority of colored families in new york can only be characterized as disgraceful mr osofsky thus underlines that the problems are not new we are also aware that these conditions could not exist in america if authority and the power structure did not either condone or ignore them osofsky helps enforce this point by describing how policemen literally got rich in the viceridden negro section of new york policemen preferred to work there it was said to get their share of underworld graft a means of reprimanding a disobedient officer was to move his beat from the vice areas he quotes lest it be thought only the rank and file were involved he goes on anyone who was captain of the district the negro section a year could live on tenderloin steaks the rest of his life in his comprehensive research osofsky even investigated negro blues and folk songs of the era involved one of which contains perhaps the most meaningful statement of thingsthen and now it goes now i started at the bottom and i stays there dont seem like im gonna get nowhere in those days it was called the blues today that feeling is called poverty mentality whatever it is called doesnt obscure the fact that it is unnecessary unchristian undemocratic and unamerican perhaps if men like osofsky repeat the message often enough and loud enough then the blues song times gonna bring about a change will become a realitybrooks johnson
africa before they came william morrow company  by galbraith welch is very like prospecting for gold in sierra madre its arduous dry and uphill but the reader is rewarded often enough with nuggests of semiprecious information about some of africas golden ages that he keeps on another incentive is the wit and humor that is often woven into the fabric of the book and on occasions it is spiced with rather interestingly risque overtones this is not to convey the notion that this is a sexy book but to the extent that the author liberally goes into the personal lives of some of our great heroes and heroines like solomon and sheba the book does cover interesting sex angles but further the author is quite eager to point out the role that the weaker sex has played in the colorful african epoch this is to cover areas where the sexual prejudices of other historians prevented them from giv ing women their fair credit in african history while she makes a pointed effort to overcome some of the basic prejudices of her male counterparts in their treatment or rather nontreatment of women she heiself falls drey to one of the historians oldest prejudices that is she appears to be prone to go into great detail about the glamor glory and marvels of africa of the sahara but africa south of the sahara is usually relegated to a few paragraphs at the end of a chapter when topics common to the two africas were discussed there are several possible reasons for this treatment other than prejudice of course its probably true that information comes easier from africa of the sahara because in so many ways it is intellectually and physically more accessible but before a book such as the one mrs welch attempts to write can really reach its potential these handicaps must be objectively and effectively overcomebrooks johnson no time for tears johnson publishing company  is both frightening and inspirational frightening because it relates a series of tragedies befalling one woman any one of which could have been crippling and which combined should have been fatal it is horrifying to think that one woman katheryn patterson experienced a broken home chronic illness culminating in epilepsy was a school dropout and when she seemed almost to have surmounted these obstacles and within sight of happiness a son was born to her who was hydrocephalic such pressures would seem enough to crush the hardiest but the resiliency of the human spirit is a truly amazing phenomenon and nowhere is it better displayed than in the case of mrs patterson the purpose of tragedy can be one of inspiration after reading her story one is likely to wonder is there really any justice in life the answer is provided by the fact that her family recovered from its misfortune and without maudlin selfpity found enough courage to lead as normal a life as circumstances would allow there is something inspirational and fulfilling about the manner in which delbert patterson her husband had the compassion understanding and fortitude to give her the necessities for overcoming her own individual problems and it is moving to learn how she in turn was able to pass these precious gifts on to her afflicted son the book eschews sympathysob prose and is told in a matter of fact fashion allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions it is fast reading simply told and worth the telling from time to time we are all prone to feel life has singled us out for a particularly nasty blow perhaps a book like this could serve as a point of reference to set the record straight againbrooks johnson
in the foreward to his autobiography go up for glory coward mccann  bill russell says i have fought in every way i know how i fought because i believed it was right to fight i think that no man should fear the consequences because every man must do that which he believes is right with a bit of hip literary drama so do a slow dissolve baby as they say in the movies into black russell takes you all the way back to monroe louisiana where he was born in  where the black begins where he first discovered he had to fight the road stretches from the childhood in monroe and then oakland california the high school where most of the teachers were a negative influence on the negro students to the university of san francisco where he spearheaded two national championship teams to the olympics where he saw politics in action and on to the boston celtics and the loneliest life in the world bill russell maintains that he is a basketball player by accident and he calls his profession a childs game the accident perhaps is that he grew much taller than most men and worked hard to develop the skills that enable him to make large sums of money for playing the childs game but bill russell approaches neither basketball nor life as a child his story naturally revolves around the world of professional basketball but his observations of the american scene from the special vantage point of superstarone of our bona fide needsshould interest those who do not know a jump shot from a rebound basketball fans will find russells nba insights fascinating but as the bearded rebel promises   this is not the friendship diary of a typical american athlete who makes good there is much causticity in his comments on how the negro views the police the march on washington the compromising that has him disenchanted with the civil_rights movement and an array of other things that have nothing to do with locker rooms and jockey straps russells concern with manhood permeates the book fame so often the great distorter seems to have given bill russell a most implacable sense of priorities he calls success relative and is adamant in maintaining that life to him is something more than a popularity contest the book concludes in reading massachusettswhere he raises his family with russell questioning that his children should be called niggers and hoping that his and his countrymens children might be spared the battles he has had to fight but russell with an amazing ability to dismiss the superficial and reduce the fantasy to truth has indeed grown more than most men in more ways than one it is perhaps an accident that at  he has written an autobiography but some accidents are worth happeningd llorens
hilip sterlings laughing on the outside the intelligent white readers guide to negro tales and humor grosset  dunlap  is a collection which both white and negro readers will smile and laugh over in his introduction saunders redding says that the humor of the negro is rooted in social oppression and the book covers the period from ole massa and the plantation to mr charlie and the civil_rights movement although the book is short it is not one to read straight through but to dip into and browse in one may have heard some of the jokes before or read others in collections like hughes and bontemps the book of negro folklore but here they are printed without the broken dialect spelling and are easier to read while they retain their conversational negro tone there are many tales which speakers could use to make a point as lincoln and khrushchev used to do a young minister trying to make a  good impression bounded into the pulpit and began to preach at the top of his voice the congregation didnt respond and his voice got weaker and weaker and he finally eased himself from the pulpit and said to the elder i dont think they liked my sermon the elder said if youd gone up like you came down you could have come down like you went up the last section of the book contains the written word by george schuyler web du bois harry golden alice childress ossie davis carl rowan langston hughes sterling brown and dick gregory petroleum v nasby describes how ole massa reacted to emancipation and st clair mckelway how mr and mrs charlie felt about their servants getting defense jobs cartoons by ollie harrington are interspersed through the book and his expressive drawing and robust humor demonstrate that he is one of the best american cartoonists a detailed table of contents and a long bibliography serve the readers convenience dudley randall
opinions of the late malcolm_x were mostly formed from the knowledge available through mainstream news media and the relatively few occasions when malcolm appeared on the popular television panel shows the mainstream news media is a poor source for discovering truth and not even malcolm was cunning enough to outmanipulate the boys down at wkkktv or what have you hence very few of us understood the man or his mission as brother malcolm if i may liked to point out you catch hell because youre a black man and he was never really at home never fully at ease or at peace with himself except when standing before his people doing what he did besttelling them why they were catching hell and exactly who was giving them hell malcolm was an orator and the tv panels were not his shot a little publicized book malcolm_x speaks merit publishers  provides a belated but much needed opportunity to understand the man moreover this selection of speeches and statements most of them taped during the final year of his life illuminates the dramatic sequel of events that led to his tragic death a sequel of events that remain to the public somewhat mysteriousquite like his death itself trial by jury notwithstanding through his words brother malcolm emerges as one obsessed by honesty  unusual phenomenon  determined to tell a little more truth about this country and this world each time he opened his handsome mouth he made no false claims in march  he humbly stated i am not educated nor am i an expert in any particular fieldbut i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials in an age of experts malcolm was a humanitarian who believed in people i for one spoke malcolm in december  believe that if you give people a thorough understanding of what it is that confronts them and the basic causes that produce it theyll create their own program and when the people create a program you get action and malcolms mission was to bring about that action he spent his last year trying to give black americans an understanding of what confronts them and trying to impress them with the necessity of identifying not merely with civil_rights but with human rights malcolm knew that so long as his people refused to look beyond this nations borders so long as they were unable to relate to peoples struggling for freedom the world over there would be no vision though he said i am not educated indeed malcolm learned a great deal about the worlds economy and malcolm possessed rare vision it was in the audubon ballroom two months before he would meet his fate there that he spoke of america and europe controlling the worlds economy so as to keep other nations living at a low standard in plain language he told why america and europe have kept the nations of latin america africa and asia from becoming industrial powers these people are beginning to see    said malcolm with reference to the poor nations as barbara ward has called them so when you hear them talking about freedom theyre not talking about a cup of coffee with a cracker no theyre talking about getting into a position to feed themselves and clothe themselves    this is the way you and i have to understand the world revolution thats taking place right now in essence brother malcolm spent the last year of his life becoming a dangerous man black men are expected to protest against the system as malcolm had done earlier to be sure but black men are not expected to start messing with the system this book of speeches reveals that malcolm was messing with this mans as malcolm liked to call him system and this fact must be known if one is to understand what malcolm represented at the time of his death unlike the handful of black intellectuals with similar vision malcolm during his final year was discovering ways to communicate his vision to the black masses and he was terribly impatient when you and i are inside of america and look at america said malcolm in december  she looks big and bad and invincible oh yes and when we approach her in that context we approach her as beggars with our hat in our hands  if we understand whats going on  in the world today and fit america into that context we find out that shes not so bad after all shes not very invincible they called him violent but like most revolutionaries brother malcolm was romantic and magnificently human when he spoke of the people his speech was marked with warmth and sensitivity and his admiration for those who battled for the peoplewhether in america africa china or whereverwas manifold to the end malcolm found honest alternatives to our constant lies and booming silence even though he probably knew it would lead to an earlv death malcolm_x speaks is a candid look at one who dared think in a nation that dared him to think black people once believed he was something horrible as white people promulged but if a black man reads this book and dares to think the only horror hell experience is the realization that the man we so desperately needed is no longer with usdavid llorens willard motleys posthumous novel let noon be fair putnams  prompts the question asked by arna bontemps in anger and beyond in his discussion of jean toomers disappearance as a negro writer he says the behavior pattern known sociologically as passing for white then has its literary equivalent and the question it raises is whether or not this is proper in the arts like mr motlevs other novels this is not a book about negroes it is about white americans in mexico and their interaction with the mexicans yet although he does not write about negroes mr motley has the observant eye of the everpresent but invisible negro who sees the whites in their unguarded moments there is a sole negro character who is mentioned in only two or three sentences  but there we feel motleys negro sensitivity to prejudice he tells how a selfappointed american official complained at the american embassy that one of his compatriots was a communist because she was seen talking to the negro the answer to mr bontemps question is that although mr motley writes of whites he has not copped out he sees them in their perversions drunkenness vulgarity idealism and lavishness with the objective ironical eye of a negro the mexican locale and characters raise a second question the question whether a writer from one culture can write convincingly of another in this mr motley seems to have succeeded i do not know mexico but the world of this novel is a coherent world mr motley writes of many characters but he does not stay long with any his method is panoramiche treats a character in a paragraph a page or several pages and then passes on to another character he is like a man setting tiles who seems to pick up the different colored pieces at random but who gradually forms a pattern we see the characters grow older have children die and we see their children mature the town of las casas grows from eight streets where almost everyone is poor but no one is hungry to a thriving resort where wealthy mexicans and americans vacation and children and professionals beg in the streets the mexicans leave their trades as fishermen and farmers and become cooks and waiters they learn the sexual deviations of the americans they learn to cheat them and to steal from them mr motley does not go inside the minds of his characters there is no psychologizing no symbolism but we get to know the characters as we learn to know our friends by their words and actions their words and actions are significant and so absorb us that it is hard to put the book down until it is finisheddudley randall  the savage state by george conchon holt rinehardt winston  is a translation of a book concerning life in a new african republic formerly under french rule the author is a former french secretary general of the central african republic it is suggested that because of his position he was able to see racism become a political issue a suggestion that implied racism became an issue after independence the fact of the matter is of course that racism had been an issue in africa before the white man and certainly remained a crucial and a basic political issue during his dominance and after it in a rather cumbersome fashion the story concerns a french couple first separated when the young wife runs away with another frenchman to africa where she leaves the second man in her life to live with an african minister of the new republic this tale is unfolded in a heavy manner which fails because the author forgot the old literary adage that which is worth saying is best stated in simple direct terms when he works with the attitudes and mannerisms of the ministers in their official surroundings the book lightens considerably this is also true of his descriptions of the heat and the scenery but leaving this for the characters the book generally loses plausibility in fairness to the author it should be stated that several of his characters are interesting but even they are sometimes difficult to believe a possible salvaging aspect of the book is the authors interesting dealing with the white masculine egos reaction to the choice of a white woman of a negro when there were attractive white men available disregarding the fact that the african is the second man the wife has been involved with since leaving her husband a young french officer in the republic to shape up the army tells the husband do something for gods sake show yourself worthy to be called a man get a move on this advice being ignored the officer says to a friend take him to bed and tuck him in hes a pansy this fellow beyond revealing how white men feel about their woman sleeping with negro men something negro men have known for some time the book at best is only relatively interesting this is unfortunate because the authors experiences prepared him for a much better effortbrooks johnson the street lights were turned off and the taxi carrying me from the airport crept cautiously through an abyss of candlelight and darkness people loomed like phantoms in the night and now and then came glimpses of the citya broken sidewalk a thatchedroof hut a shirtless cripple sitting on the ground a putrid smell permeated the alleys and now and then the wail of a beggar donnezmoi    donnezmoi    it was against this setting in the midst of this hell that i first viewed the presidents palace floodlit extravagant it sat mockingly in its little squarea defiant monument to greed cruelty and meglomania there are places in this world that transcend spatial limits and approach the realm of dream tibet they say is one of these as well as certain regions of the himalayas yet another though for social rather than physical reasons is the caribbean republic of haiti it is here in the dictator state of president francois duvallier that graham greene has set his latest novel the comedians viking  and it is a case for a while anyway of fiction being just as strange as truth through much of the book haiti soars beyond the conscious is a kind of modernway inferno of wooden huts  an occasional candle over a little group bowed over their rum like mourners over a coffin but the altitude once set is not maintained the comedians for all its promise of allegory inevitably bogs down in the shallows of politics sociology and bible morality the protagonist is a man named brown who is returning to his adopted country after failing to sell his resort hotel near portauprince on the boat back he meets jones a sort of international gay blade looking for  adventure and the smiths a naive american couple who plan to establish of all things a haitian vegetarian mission vegetarianism isnt only a question of diet mr brown  if we really eliminate acidity from the human body we would eliminate passion each is examined in his relation to haitis police state needless to say the americans are quickly disposed of at the first assault on their jeffersonian sensibilities they flee in despair to the dominican republic jones surprisingly acquires a sense of purpose and joins the resistance movement but brown although exposed for the first time to a clearcut moral issue cannot regain the faith he lost at a monte carlo seminary a political as well as a religious cynic he discovers too late that the world for all its senselessness is after all real the conclusion is of course true yet the truth of a major novelist one feels should run a bit deeper the comedians indeed in its unfulfilled promises reads like a blueprinted masterpiece that went astray and greene one of the best of the moderns typifies the general poverty of midth century literature at one point for example protagonist brown finds himself face to face with one concasseur a captain in duvalliers notorious secret police the tontons macoute this monster this mindless assassin of women and children betrays for a fleeting moment just the briefest glimmer of compassion and brown reflects i could understand whv these men  wore dark glassesthey were human  a true psychologist a dostoievsky say would have just begun his probebeyond freud beyond christ into the unresolved regions of the human personality but greene balks at the challenge concasseur emerges as a shallow onedimensional villain who simply hates revolutionaries for all the modesty of his concept however greene demonstrates once again his special qualifications like a true heavyweight he operates easily in the realm of myth with duvallier appropriately likened to baron samedi a voodoo demigod and a saturday night visitor to haitian graveyards a grotesque figure in a ballet stepping it lightly in his top hat and tails    on the sheer plane of journalism moreover the book while not totally free of that irritating and really needless specialness western writers apply to negroes is a largely objective representation of haiti at least as this reviewer experienced it last summer it is also a tribute to the haitian people one of the most civilized in all latin america in their persistent resistance to a mad tryant hamilton bims a the two worlds of somerset maugham by wilson menard sherbourne press  is one of the most rewarding reading surprises this reviewer has come across in some time the book jacket has a rather impressively haughty painting of mr maugham on the front the great author is literally looking down his hawklike nose with his hands and legs folded in an almost too precise manner sitting on what appears to be a rattan stool the whole image projects a kind of grand majestic quality calculated to make the reader wonder if he could not better spend his time reading something else the thematic impressions suggested by the painting are skillfully captured and developed by the author mr menard the impression given by maugham staring from the painting is that he is a prig and a snob the fact that mr maugham was something of a snob is beyond question but this snobbery is skillfully shown by mr menard to be based not on race or station but on whether or not he found the person interesting his contact with the natives of the pacific his understanding and appreciation of their mores and sex standards substantiates the fact that though he had little time for those who bored him he was most patiently understanding and appreciative of those whom he thought manifested honesty and character a theme suggested by the rattan stool is that maugham was comfortable in the south pacific atmosphere and further that he got some support from this nothing could be more true as some of his most famous and rewarding tales came from that part of the world where he understood what was going on and where he felt comfortable in the setting there was something sensual about the south pacific of that time and maugham was sensual in his appetites although it appeared he was in some manner above or beyond sex it is amply clear that he was the recipient of some sort of vicarious sensuality from mr menards repititions of conversations he had with maugham about the islands since the topic recurring with the most regularity is sex and the manner and means in which it was practiced and enjoyed by the people of the south seas the reader is often on the point of asking himself was mr maugham in fact a homosexual there is something in the painting to suggest this and indeed obituaries have suggested as well that he had a certain ambivalence in this respect the delicate manner in which the hands rest in the painting is one clue and there are other points which cause one to wonder but the reader soon realizes that this is a minor theme at best and becomes deeply involved in this extremely interesting book about an extremely interesting man mr menard deserves to take a deep bow for the job he did in making this book exceptionally readable aided though he was by his genuine interest and liking for his subject matter as well as the fact that he and mr maugham had a great deal in common but without his considerable talents as a writer traveler and researcher the book would never have come off as well as it has perhaps the best way to sum it up is to say that this is not a book done to capitalize on the morbid appetites which develop after the death of a famous person this is a book done by a man skilled in his

the white kid on the floor next to me bore the brunt of the violence that was going on in our area near the lunch counter i was sorry as hell for him on one hand but guiltily glad it was him instead of me on the other the next day i was too ashamed to look him in the face and a sort of coolness grew between us based upon nothing but the fact that i somehow felt he had gotten a beating that should have been intended for me since that experience i have often wondered what white civil_rights workers feel and think as they take to the picket lines lunch counters and such sally belfrages freedom summer viking press  comes about as close as i have been able to get in coming up with some meaningful answers freedom summer is more than just a revelation of some of the feelings and thoughts of a white civil_rights worker it is a sensitive interesting perceptive piece of work the author is a very gifted writer and observer she is both a young impressionable girl full of good intentions and deeds and at the same time she is a realist that nothing of note escapes the combination is very fruitful as it is displayed in her book freedom summer offers the reader a welcomed escape from the usual well intentioned but lacking works that have been cranked out on this subjectbrooks johnson
political science political theory philosophy and even physics for that matter all deal with the same topics if one gets deep enough into the subjects ultimately there must be some a priori determination about the nature of the universe and mans relationship to and position in the universe in the case of philosophy and social sciences there must be a determination about the real nature of man himself from this determination comes a logical progression of assumptions and notions about men that culminates in what we now call liberal or conservative political views neil staebler and douglas ross have compiled a book how to argue with a conservative grossman publishers inc  to give you ammunition to defend liberal and demolish conservative arguments there is a certain pitfall in the book itself because it does such a good job of demonstrating how to argue with a conservative it might be assumed that the arguments presented in the book are the answer to conservatism but the hard truth of the matter is that the book does an excellent job of getting at the symptoms of conservatism but the causes are really couched in the conservatives basic concept of man for the liberals the logical progression starts with the notion that man is basically good and has altruistic ethical judicious forces within him and it is circumstances usually that make him anything other than a good person for the conservative man is basically bad and it takes discipline learning determination and courage to change himself into something desirable this is perhaps a gross oversimplification of the points of views but essentially it is pertinently correct mr ross and mr staebler have done an excellent job of selecting out some of the more troublesome points of the conservative and providing us with adequate answers but the real problem in changing a conservative is not to thwart his arguments but to change his thinking about men basically i suppose that if a person were exposed to the devastating dialogue of this book he might want to make certain reappraisals about things but im not certain that he would be that moved to make the basic alterations in his conception of men to make him liberal but in all fairness to the book it does what it sets out to do what is now needed is not a criticism of this book but the production of a book that is convincing enough to alter the basic thinking about the true nature of man there can be no real permanent improvement unless man is seen in more positive light by men but the fact that this problem has been articulated and argued in the works of the early thinkers and philosophers right down to today convincingly attests to the resiliency of the problem and the elusiveness of acceptable permanent answers perhaps there are none but the mere glimmer of hope that there may be one is reason enough to goad men on further and further in the search for answersbrooks johnson 
when t s eliot wrote some of the essays in to criticize the critic farrar straus  giroux  he was a controversial avantgrade poet now with the collection and publication of these essays after his death he is a venerable member of the establishment with rebellion flaring among the beatniks the black mountain school and the new york school what helped him get into the establishment besides his composing very good poetry was his authoritative criticism which helped to explain his kind of verse his critical essays not only afforded understanding of the poets whom he discussed but gave insights into the writing of poetry he was able to embody these insights in memorable phrases like dissociation of sensibility and objective correlative which served as touchstones to a particular style some of the same insights into literature and language occur in this book and i cannot do better than to quote a few of them which incidentally answer some of his younger criticson a separate american language advocated by william carlos williams but i was puzzled by the subtitle it is called a dictionary of the american language perhaps i am unconsciously bilingual so that whichever language i hear or read seems to me my own but certainly the vast majority of the words in this dictionary are words belonging to both america and england and having the same meaning in both and the definitions seemed to me to be written in english too the following quotation could apply to the beatniks to insist on the allimportance of subjectmatter to insist that the poet should be spontaneous and irreflective that he should depend upon inspiration and neglect technique would be a lapse from what is in any case a highly civilized attitude to a barbarous one eliots reflections on vers libre published in  are just as valid today with todays attacks on the iambic pentameter he says but the most interesting verse which has yet been written in our language has been done either by taking a very simple form like the iambic pentameter and constantly withdrawing from it or taking no form at all and constantly approximating to a very simple one    freedom is only freedom when it appears against the background of an artificial limitation    the division between conservative verse and vers libre does not exist for there is only good verse bad verse and chaosdudley randall i as a new kid in town  had to go through my share of fights and squabbles to prove that i was not to be messed with but there was another kid who never seemed to be  able to prove that he was not to be messed with i accidentally found out one day that his father owned the jewstore and somehow in my eight year old brain i connected his fathers occupation with the burden the kid had to bear one day i was about to fight with a kid bigger and older because he deliberately threw my ball down a long hill i didnt relish the encounter because i wasnt sure of the outcome but he had done it without any cause and  had to take him on or lose face in front of the others just as i was about to get it on a voice rang out ill get it and down the hill ran this jew kid he came back up triumphantly with the ball he was winded but said to the bully the next time you do that im gonna kick your ass i wasnt too sure i wanted someone fighting my battles for me but i was somehow certain that this kid wasnt just taking up for me a strange affinity grew up between us and we became close friends we both became known as capable guys with our fists but when it got around that we had formed a sort of mutual protection pact we were left to do pretty much as we pleased i knew that because my friend was jew and i a negro we shared something in common that separated us from the white kids yet it gave us a special understanding and appreciation of each other rabbi abraham l feinbergs storm the gates of jericho marzani  munsell  provides the reader with a special insight into jewry but more than that it does so in an interesting and moving literary style the special result of reading the book is the fact that people of open minds and goodwill are enabled to better understand and appreciate rabbi feinberg in particular and something of jewry in generalgreat books bring something new to the world in one form or another good books usually bring refreshing style restatement of established ideas clarification about existing things or better insights rabbi feinbergs book is a good book he brings new clarity and understanding in what might be termed an autobiography but the understanding takes manv different forms much of it is scathing criticism of the hypocrisy foolishness and supercilious things to which the world spends precious time and effort paying homage but despite the fact that feinberg states that jews are just people we must also keep in mind another fact moses jesus marx freud and einstein all were jews if a people who represent just one half of one percent of the worlds population can produce men of this caliber then the rest of us have some lessons to learn from them and thats the real value of the book it provides us with lessons that would benefit us all to learn and applybrooks johnson
in the interactions between the white man and the black man there is one fact that emerges with clarity and impactthe black man knows his white counterpart infinitely better than the white man knows his colored brother white men it appears go to africa for myriad kinds of reasons but despite this variety of motive we see something of a uniformity in the kind of reactions and thinking they express about africa this is because they are relatively consistent in their lack of understanding of the black man and thus anything they might later think or articulate is shaped and warped by this ignorance sean grahams a surfeit of sun doubleday  is another example of the post african independence novel we see coming from intelligent gifted writers who have spent time in africa and are now chronicling africas problems after independence there is a formula that is discernible in these books we have interracial involvement between the major characters combining with race prejudice from both sides mixed liberally with the inefficiency of the local african government to produce circumstances that cause the natives to revert to savagery it is certainly true that these elements do exist and can and do combine to create rather undesirable situations but a rather constant flow of this kind of story certainly distorts the picture and the last thing that africa needs is more distortion but further and even more distasteful is the fact that the books leave the reader with the feeling that the reasons for the chaos is because black men are now in the drivers seat the truth of the matter is that we have problems in africa because we have unskilled untrained sometimes greedy men in power who happen to be black white airconditioned ibm thinking is applied in a tropical setting where the greatest need is perhaps antibiotics and education and this thinking comes up with the conclusion that what is necessary is more colonialism surfeit is defined as meaning excess superfluity overabundant supply with mr grahams book i think a surfeit has been reached in this kind of bookbrooks johnson 
at the  eastwest v  p allstar game seven   of the ten starters were hoards neg ro  a former nba player once an allstar himself walked out of the arena shortly after the game began i was disgusted he said later there were just too many of them i couldnt get interested in watching them play on november   st louis started three negroes against philadelphia which started four by the second period all ten players on the court were negro nobody wants to say anything but of course the owners are worried how are you going to draw with  colored players on your teaman nba coach oscar robertson sat on his bed in a new york hotel room one day several weeks ago sure he was saying to someone you cant overlook the situation  dont know if what wilt said was true but people cant say its not true it could be true the owners and the players know it could be true what wilt had said in a wabc radio interview with howard cosell was that the growth of the nba had been held back by the preponderance of negro stars in the nba wilt said it calmly and with the reservation i think a theory a theory which if correct suggests something about the sports fans of this nation was wilt correct did the men who run the nba agree and if so were they reacting with regard for high principles or their pocketbooks i put the questions to nba general managers coaches and players their answers varied i will get to them in a moment but there was agreement on this in an astonishingly short time negro players have come to dominate the league in  there were only six negroes among the leagues  players of these only one maurice stokes was an allstar early this season of  playing jobs in the national basketball association  were held by negroes of these   were normally starters and of that   were allstars in other words almost half the nba players were negro twothirds of the starters were negro and nearly three of every four allstars were negro and there are more coming the next wave of superstars is  percent negro cazzie russell of michigan is todays top college senior mel daniels of new mexico is  the top junior westley unseld of louisville is the top sophomore lew alcindor of ucla is the top freshman how to explain this flood of negro talent they have a natural talent for basketball one exnba player told me basketball is a rhythm game and negroes have that natural rhythm the rhythm theory got whoops from negro players heck said one for every negro with natural moves there are ten who can hardly run without tripping but you get to see only the one guy with natural ability we make it by work work work said oscar robertson another negro star told me we know we can t settle for being as good as a white player like in everything else we got to be betterlots betteror were not going to get the job they say negroes naturally jump higher than whites the negro jumps higher because he knows if he doesnt its back to the ghetto  several nba people cited gus johnson as an example of the negro athletes tremendous drive to succeed jerry lucas has more natural ability than gus said one player but gus will outplay him more often than not gus grew up playing ball on the streets of akron ohio and all he heard about was that lucas kid at middletown and how great he was jerry went to ohio state and all of ohio raved about him gus had to go to idaho now when he plays against jerry gus eats him alive and jerry doesnt do much against gus you can see gus out there and i know hes thinking i had nothing in my life never had and this big white kid had everything ill show him ill show him  most negroes grew up with a basketball court around the corner in the slums says walter kennedy commissioner of the nba there is no room for little league baseball or junior football but you can play basketball wherever you put up a hoop and it costs nothing a kid goes to a schoolyard checks out a basketball and he can play all day summer and winter another thing when i was a boy i wanted to be like babe ruth just as negro kids my age wanted to be joe louis in the last decade negro kids can imagine themselves being wilt or oscar with boxing on the decline negro kids have new idols to pattern themselves after and as a result you get more negro stars in baseball and basketball certainly the number of negroes is increasing in all sports but in basketball the players wear the briefest uniforms no face masks no head covering either and the fans are closest to the court willie mays races back for a fly ball and his glove darts up out of a blur of white or grey uniform jim brown assaults a line and a bright orange helmet spearheads a swiftmoving missile of dark shirt and white pants bill russell reaches for a rebound and black skin sparkles when boston starts k c jones sam jones bill russell tom sanders and willie naullsas red auerbach has doneone need not be a racist to note that all five are negro when the st louis hawks warm up one sees  men clustered in the small area of halfcourt and needs no adding machine to count that seven are negro one sees the philadelphia ers come out for a tapoff and need have no eagle eye to ascertain that five of the six players on the bench are white chamberlain believes this preponderance of negro talent will hold back the leagues growth and he explained why to howard cosell  people for some reason    tend to    pull for things somewhat similar or like themselves and so    when they come out they want to root for something thats similar something they can see themselves in    this is not always true of course there are little white boys who pick up a bat and say im willie mays but by and large as chamberlain said people root for something thats similar something they can see themselves in they do it he said for some reason the reason we suggest is race prejudice subtle prejudice unconscious prejudice very often but it is there and the fear of nba owners the question that worries them is in a society that is  percent white is this prejudicethis ability of some white spectators to identify with negro athletesdeep enough and widespread enough to hold back nba growth to be specific will it  keep attendance on a permanent plateau  dim interest of tv sponsors  prevent the spread of franchises to the south let us examine each question  will it hold down attendance our figures simply do not back up wilts claim that our attendance is stagnating says haskell cohen nba publicity director attendance last year was  percent up from the year before during the past five years our attendance on the average has increased by ten per cent each year this year says commissioner kennedy attendance in the first month was up more than  per cent over the comparable period last season i would say definitely that attendance this season will exceed the  per cent gain we made last season when a team wins says cohen it draws when it loses  attendance falls off its as simple as that ill give you a good example says kennedy san francisco when we went in there pro basketball was unknown and attendance was awful but in  the team won the western title and attendance went way up in   the team finished with the worst wonlost record in nba history and attendance dropped almost to where it had started in that period the ratio of negro to white players on the team didnt change much this proves i would think that the boxoffice record of a team is tied directly to the wonlost record of a team a number of negro players agreed with kennedy look at the dodgers in baseball said st louis lenny wilkens sometimes they had five or six negroes on the field and they drew two million they drew because they won overall nba attendance has jumped  per cent since  equalling the growth rate of pro football and far outpacing baseballs minuscule five per cent it is true that nba attendance is less than half the attendance of the national football league though each nba team plays  games and each nfl team only  but a  per cent annual growth rate even allowing for some exaggeration in  the counting is hardly stagnation where wilt is on firmer ground is when he points a finger toward boston the celtics are the pride of the league winner of seven straight championships as winners in  they averaged  in attendance as winners four years later they averaged  the boston arena holds  chamberlain did not say this but his point is implicit when he discusses celtic attendance when whites like bob cousy and bill sharman starred with russell attendance was on the rise when the jones boys replaced the two white stars attendance crept up only slightly averaging out to less than  per cent a year in an affluent city with a championship ballclub the best of all timethis might well be called stagnation why should a team with a record compiled such as it boston has wilt said to cosell not draw to capacity crowds whereas the hockey team fills the house almost every night are you saying to me said cosell that one of the reasons that hockey plays to  per cent attendance capacity is because it is all white i definitely believe that said wilt hockey draws well in boston answers commissioner kennedy because boston is the seat of american hockey basketball pro or college was never big there until after the war 
anyway if what wilt says is true then the logical alternative would be that if hockey added negro players attendance would decline i doubt that it would fall off and again the commissioner cites the rise in overall nba attendance but the unanswerable question the question nba owners consider is would league attendance have gone up higher if there were more white stars  will the negro dominance dim tv interest the american broadcasting company paid the american football league  million to telecast  football games in the fall of  the same network paid the nba  to telecast  basketball games in  in broadcasting circles it was said that the reason for the disparity in prices was the lack of a white nba star that question never came up in our negotiations with abc says kennedy and believe me a lot of questions came up the reason for the difference in prices says nba officials is that nba teams have local tv contracts which afl teams do not have these local telecasts make nba games less attractive to the networks thus the lower network bid abctv says it has been happily surprised by the ratings for nba games last season the ratings were averaging  per cent of tunedin sets which was slightly higher than the ratings for afl football games however the afl games had to compete against nfl telecasts but there is no sign of any frenzied bidding as there is for pro football among the tv networks for nba games im only being realistic one broadcasting man told me when i say that if a white center were to come along to challenge chamberlain or russell the ratings for those games would jump at least fifty per cent  will the negro dominance limit the spread of new franchises into the south of present franchises only baltimore and st louis could be considered southern cities st louis attendance is soso baltimores poor but neither have titlecontending teams the baltimore situation is interesting baltimore has a high negro population and the teams two stars for a long timegus johnson and walt bellamyare negro yet the percentage of negro attendance is far below the percentage of negroes in the city this has raised another disturbing question for the nba if an nba team were to be allnegro would it not only alienate some whites but also fail to drawfor economic or whatever reasonsthe citys negro fans not so said several negro players a team with a lot of negroes will draw white and negro fansif it wins said one baltimore doesnt draw negroes because it loses a negro fan is like a white fanhe wants his moneys worth of some odd applications for new nba franchises two have come from the deep southatlanta and new orleans one indication that such franchises could succeed came this winter st louis with seven negroes on the squad scheduled eight games in memphis tennessee in their first memphis game the hawks drew a hefty  an nba club would go over in the south with  per cent negro players said one white southern player but the team would have to be a winner the fact then is that negro players have come to dominate the nba and economic questions have arisen as a result the fact too is that important nba men have been thinking about these economic questions their thought has spurred some action and some criticism for starters this seems certain the negro fringe player has been badly hurt up to  or so says a man close to the nba you kept a colored player as your ninth or tenth man you had to pay him only  or so a lot less than you had to pay a white boy but not any more now the tenth and th players are white boys to balance off the squad today you replace white with white colored with colored as your white bench men slow down you draft whites to replace them when your colored starters slow down you draft negroes because  it is a lot easier to get a fast strong  negro forward than a white one if you have to go with a  white forward against a  negro forward youre in trouble the white boy isnt strong enough fast enough tough enough if youre eighth or ninth man and colored youre dead one negro player told me if an owner has to cut someone he cuts whats a worry for hima negro the racial balancing of teams began as a gentlemans agreement believes willie jones who played for detroit from  to  willie was a hustling  guard and when detroit cut him a baltimore official talked about picking him up what for said someone else hes an eighth or ninth man and hes colored today willie at  is in the insurance business in chicago he says he has no bitterness toward the nba he thinks he was cut because he didnt get along with coach charley wolf but he has no illusions either around  he says i think the owners said lets keep the number of negroes down to say no more than three but then someone started to carry four and he was winning and he said the hell with the agreement so the others started to carry four then five to catch up and the thing kept buildmg several years ago when the bullets were run by a different management its draft pickers were reportedly told get a forward any forward as long as hes a white forward the bullets drafted gary bradds whod slowed down a step in his senior year at ohio state what really killed me said one man close to the baltimore team is that we could have gotten either willis reed or lucious jackson jackson and reed became league allstars bradds was cut this year commissioner kennedy likes to repeat what the late walter brown owner of the celtics told bill russell several years ago after russell had charged there was a racialquota system in the league said brown to russell i dont care if youre pink white or eskimo youve got a job on this team as long as you can play basketball but kennedy concedes that he has no way of knowing whether all owners share browns sentiments one nba coach tacitly admitted there was a racial quota when he told me you know we cant carry  of them there is no quota system on my club says richie guerin coach of the hawks if there were do you think i would have retired mike farmer white and kept jim washington a negro who like farmer is st louis tenth or th man richie is one in a million says a negro on the hawks the rest of the nba is the same as baseball they figured a negro cant play as a regular so they let him go around the league they will tell you that the hawks loaded with negroes are desperate for a white star to replace pettit the hawks wanted billy cunningham who is white real bad in the draft last year says one nba coach the hawks died when philadelphia picked billy ahead of them we play to win answers hawk general manager marty blake thats all we care about another coach said he thought red auerbach was having second thoughts now that he is the general manager about the race situation i notice said the coach he plays ron bonham a lot now and he boosts mel counts both are white we put the best men out there auerbach roars only the best were not interested in politics or race problems im a basketball coach thats all the nba brass may not be interested in politics or race problems per se but since politics and race problems are interwoven here with that motivator in pro sports economicsthere is nba interest and says one negro explayer on the subject of negroes and nba economics suppose oscar and wilt and bill withdrew from the league the nba would be wrecked i think the negro has helped more than hurt the league true but now with one nba team official saying the talent in negro colleges is unbelievable they have  guards who dunk and with another man saying that on a talent basis within a few years the league could be  percent to  percent negro the fear is that has hurt will soon if it has not already replace has helped times have changedfor the betterbut prejudice did not die with the civil_rights act of  the nba knows it is facing a problem it cannot morally or legally discriminate one immediate solution to the problem suggested to me by nearly every nba player and coach to whom i talked was expansion i dont see any reason one negro star told me why pro basketball cant support as many clubs as pro baseball or pro football the thinking is that at least  percent of these new jobs would be filled by negroes but others would be taken by whites who otherwise would be shut out of the nba the thinking too is that with expansion there could be four divisions giving better balance and more winners and winners usually do well at the box office another solution suggested by one nba team official is more vigorous promotion of the league just as it ispromotion to offset prejudice i hear them moan says one nba team official they say how can i draw with all those negroes i got on this club the trouble with them is they dont know how to promote the greatest game in the world they think all they have to do is throw open the doors expansion and more vigorous promoting these are two solutions the real solution of course must take place inside peoples minds 
david was happy he was waiting for victoria to ask her a if she answer question and gave him the he expected he would be happier still he had played in the schoolyard all afternoon and when he had enough of play he came up to his den in the attic his den was at the end of the attic near the one small window level with the floor his desk was an old army blanket spread on the floor his bookcase an egg crate containing his books and notebooks the window overlooked the playground which extended from his backyard to the school near the other end of the block he swung it open admitting the freshness of the april afternoon and the voices of the children on the schoolyard davids glance wandered over the field flooded with sunshine a group of boys and a group of girls were playing baseball and smaller children were climbing on the swing supports and the horizontal bars near the alley some older youths were playing dice with one on the lookout for the roaches the bright shirts and dresses the movements of the ball players the crack of bats on balls and the shouts of the players made the field a world of color and motion and sound david projected himself into the scene he was striking the ball running the bases he was crouched in the corner over the dice caressing them and talking to them like a lover while he was immersed in these actions he was aware of another self that stood aloof and watched him doing these things and of yet another self that watched him watching himself like a series of mirrors david did not see victoria on the playground and he began to write in his notebook in the spring of his seventeenth year david first saw her and fell in love with her she was playing with other girls but she was the only one he saw she outhit and outran and outlaughed them all she was tall and lithe and shapely her arms and legs were bare and darkened by the sun to the color of bronze her voice was like the sound of silver that was how he first saw victoria he learned her name from his friends and asked his big sister about her rachel laughed are you carrying a torch for victoria what do you see in her shes boxankled and walleyed she has big eyes and pretty legs david paid no attention to rachel she was laughing at him only because he was interested in a different girl from the ones she was always trying to put off on him and in whom he was never interested rachel told him that victoria was an orphan she lived with her uncle and her aunt who made her do all the housework but let her come and go as she pleased after she had done her work david learned all these things about her before he ever spoke to her one day as he was shambling along the street with his eyes cast down to avoid stumbling on the level pavement he saw a pair of small feet then a pair of brown legs he did not know whose they were but there was something familiar and exciting about them looking up he saw victoria coming toward him there was no one whom he would rather have met yet he began thinking of ways to avoid her he looked about wildly but he had passed the alley and had not reached the cross street he could turn into a doorway or cross to the other side of the street but that would be too obvious he could pass her without speaking but that was rude but if he spoke to her first would she answer him now she was upon him what could he do she smiled and said hello david david grew dizzy and faint and thought he was going to fall on the street he put out his hand as if to clutch at something and stammered hhello after she passed he leaned against a telephone pole until he was able to walk again after that he would speak to her whenever they met he made no attempt to seek her out or to go the places where she might be he was content with occasional chance meetings they made his days rich and adventuresome who could tell when and where he would see her he would speak to her she would smile at him and utter his name always the same thing happened to him the blood rushed to his face his knees grew weak he became dizzy and could hardly speak he would make his way back home giddy and excited and would write an account of the meeting about this time he became acquainted with dantes love poetry in the new life it expressed his emotions perfectly dantes chance meetings with beatrice and his adoration of her were just like his encounters with victoria and his love for her he read him incessantly and learned the new life almost by heart he bought an italian grammar and a book of italian poetry and read dantes love poems in the original things might have gone on like this indefinitely if he had not had a  talk with ned adams david liked to go to the settlement house sometimes to work out with the boxers one night ned adams who was the city amateur middleweight champion asked him to go a couple of rounds with him david shook ned twice with rights to the head the champion could have hurt him in retaliation but goodnaturedly refrained he smothered david with left hooks and looping rights to the head but his blows had no more sharpness than the sheathed paws of a playful kitten when they were dressing ned looked him up and down and said youre built like a fighter you have a punch like a mule and are fast as hell why dont you train regular in two years we could make a champion out of you a lightweight on the next bench laughed hes too busy chasing tail david said hotly i cant be bothered with girls they get in my hair ned looked at him skeptically he was older than david about twenty maybe you dont have the right line girls like to be courted you cant stand off and expect them to come to you you have to go to them i know that girls cant talk sense like you can talk to another guy you have to give them a lot of bull tell em theyre pretty and crap like that theyll eat it up and theres another thing you have to play each one different im fooling around with a little fox thats trying to play hard to get ive been giving her the absent line i havent been around for two or three weeks when i do show up shell be ready to fall into my lap victoria is not like that david thought nevertheless neds words made him think of getting better acquainted with her so far he had been content to admire her from a distance this feeling had come on him so suddenly that he had not had time to adjust to it he was not sure what he would do but he vaguely imagined that some time in the future victoria would be his girl now he began to think of some practical means of winning her he made up his mind that the next time he met her instead of merely saying hello he would stop and talk with her and learn to know her better the very next day when he walked into mr siegels drugstore he saw her standing by the counter he was totally unprepared for the meeting at least when he met her on the street he had some seconds of preparation before speaking to her now he was totally surprised he could hardly stand so he dropped upon a stool at the soda fountain victoria smiled at him thinking of things to say he forgot to say anything mr siegel said whatll it be david mechanically he blurted out ill take a soda then suddenly to victoria wont you have one with me no thanks i just had one his heart sank she hesitated but i wouldnt mind another one she sat down by his side they began to talk of school and of neighborhood events david had often dreamed of some day talking to wise men and poets but even in his imagination those conversations were not so exciting as this one with victoria she was easy to talk with and gradually david became outwardly calm but all the while the air seemed shaking with some tremendous music of organ or full orchestra to which his heart blood and pulse danced riotously he never knew what they said but he noticed how long black and curly her hair was and how it poured upon her shoulders her eyebrows were straight and thick the lashes long and glossy her eyes were large and soft her nose delicately chiselled her skin was coppercolored and her cheek suffused with red had the gentle curves of a childs after she finished her soda she stood up and said thank you for the soda i enjoyed it as she walked out he noticed the way her waist tapered from her shoulders and breasts he sat with his head on his hands thinking about her at last mr siegel said david does anything hurt you david started up without a word and walked out for the next two days david lived in the memory of those moments then he began to miss victoria he watched for her from the window looked for her in the streets and even walked past her house but he did not see her one day rachel found him sitting moodily in front of the window and said david why are you sitting by the window looking half dead holy pete if you like victoria why dont you go out and get her instead of mooning in front of the window and reading those silly books but what can i do shes never invited me to her house i wouldnt invite you to my house either if i were victoria in the first place why dont you get rid of that sloppy sweatshirt and those baggy pants and change to a shirt and tie and then get some savoirfaire is that what those overdressed dimwits that come to see you are supposed to have at least theyre more polished than you my shabby bookworm but listen to me im trying to help you if you want victoria to be your girl youll have to go out and get her faint heart never won fair lady why dont you invite her to go out with you but where could i take her there are lots of places movies picnics dances i know just the thing my clubs giving a dance next month you can invite her to that for a start ill give you an invitation  but how can i take her to a dance you know i cant dance ill teach you you have weeks to learn come on lets get busy right away rachel put a record on the phonograph and began to show david the basic steps after he learned them she had him dance with her dont stand so far away i wont bite you im your sister now relax let yourself go and dont be so wooden and for heavens sake dont look so mad youre not in a gym at the end of his first lesson david had made definite progress he danced every day with rachel and practiced by himself often he was stiff and selfconscious but sometimes he forgot himself in the music and rachel would look at him in surprise and say youre doing fine victoria will enjoy dancing with you her praise would make him conscious again of what he was doing he would look at his feet and think of the steps and then rachel would scold him for making mistakes at the end of a week of daily sessions he thought he had learned enough to invite victoria to go with him to the dance today he was going to invite her he was waiting until she appeared on the playground then he would go outside and speak to her he looked out the window again behind the roofs were pink and orange clouds the level sunlight stretched long shadows across the field reflected from the red bricks of the street the light took on a rosy hue victory was not on the field david reached for his book of italian poetry and began to read one of dantes love sonnets how wonderfully dante described beatrice and the way he felt about her how wonderful that the description fitted his own girl and himself so perfectly the poem seemed to be not dante talking about beatrice but himself speaking of victoria he would translate it he would put it into english so she could read it and at the dance maybe he would show it to her he turned to a blank page in his notebook and began to write my lady carries love within her eyes how true that was about victoria her eyes were soft and warm and contained nothing but kindness the first line of a sonnet was always the easiest now for the second which renders noble all she looks upon how true that line was also for whenever he saw victoria he felt cleaner and finer just as dante had written the divine comedy for beatrice one day he would write a great poem for victoria the second line of a sonnet was generally easy too but the third line was where the rimes and the difficulty began when she goes by men turn and gaze at her that was exactly what happened whenever victoria walked down the street for david was not the only one she attracted when she passed slim and graceful with her long black hair hanging over her shoulders he had seen men turn around and draw in their breath but that line would not fit it did not rime with either of the preceding lines the thought of her walking down the street reminded david that this was about the time she came to the playground he glanced out the window she was there she wore a plain white dress like a nurses which fitted snugly at the waist she was playing catch with another girl two boys stood nearby watching now and then they said something to her and they all laughed she missed the ball and one of the boys turned to retrieve it for her but she raced him to the ball and picked it up herself he grabbed her around the waist but she twisted smoothly away from him that was one of the things david liked about her she did not allow anyone to take liberties with her even when boys tried to do her favors because she was a girl she refused to accept them but kept herself in a position of equality with them her refusal was not the curt i can do anything you can do and better too of some athletic girls but a gracious declining that still left them pleased with themselves and with her she was popular with all the boys and with girls also everything david noticed about her made him like her and since he stumbled on every curb and every flight of stairs was ashamed to look into mirrors and could never think of anything to say he admired her all the more because she was graceful and beautiful and friendly now he would go out and speak to her now he would ask her to go to the dance with him and she would consent he stood up to go but after taking a step he paused suppose she refused what could he say to persuade her until now he had not imagined anything but that she would consent now the thought of failure made cold sweat come on his brow he had better wait a few minutes and think it over perhaps he could think of some winning graceful way to ask her he picked up the book and lay down again to think how clean and fresh she looked in the museum was the torso of a greek girl which he loved the cold white marble seemed to breathe and be soft and warm to the touch victoria reminded him of this torso but with a subtle difference she had not the antique greek lines her shoulders were wider her breasts larger her abdomen flatter and deeper and she could not be expressed in cold white marble she was like a statue of bronze of warm polished bronze with a glaze that gleamed silver in the light above the warm brown metal beneath there was such a glaze on her skin he imagined it to be sleek to his fingers his attention was diverted to the  schoolyard by a sudden movement two figures split from the knot of gamblers and walked toward the far end of the yard david recognized them as ned adams and willie george lee ned wore a closefitting white rayon polo shirt blue jeans and moccasins he was stocky and barrelchested but moved easily and lightly willie george was also a boxer a flyweight and a tapdancer as well he danced in the smaller night clubs he was older than ned and one of his cronies he was dapper as a flea in a lavender sport shirt green slacks and brown suede shoes ned and willie george swaggered across the playground boys greeted them and girls turned and looked into their faces but the fighters did not notice them they stopped a few feet from victoria she held the ball in her hand and looked around ned stared straight at her she looked into his eyes she dropped the ball ned picked it up and handed it to her she smiled they began to talk meanwhile willie george accosted the other girl she was a short plump girl named eva whose brother was feebleminded david knew her for one night she came to him and a friend on the schoolyard and asked them to lie down in the doorway of the school with her the boys stared at each other hot flustered my father told me to come home they said in unison and walked away now willie george seized her by the waist and led her through a dance step they laughed and applauded themselves it was growing darker the color of the air deepened from rose to violet one by one or in little groups the boys and girls went home their cries and laughter faded away in the dusk the two couples were alone in the shadows the street lamps came on there was one in the alley near the schoolhouse it cast a silver light over the field but the entrance of the building recessed was deep in shadow ned was still talking to victoria he leaned close to her took her by the hand pulled her toward him she did not resist or draw away as she did with the other boys davids face burned he could imagine vividly her quick smile her large slowmoving eyes her ringing laughter the sweet smell of soap on her body the electric atmosphere about her the impression of delicacy yet strength that her shape conveyed he could also imagine her sensing neds confident grin his powerful chest his deep vibrant voice his pungent sweat they stood close together their bodies touching davids whole body was on fire he would go down there he would join them he would make believe he was passing by and would stop and talk with them but something kept him rooted there like a spectator at a play who identifies himself with the actors and is involved in the action but who can in no way influence it part of himself was victoria and part of himself ned with another self watching himself the actor and a third self watching himself the observer eva squealed willis george was unbuttoning her blouse she shook her head and pulled away he grabbed her arm and dragged her toward the doorway she leaned back resisting and shrieking but her shrieks dissolved in giggles and she let herself be dragged along they disappeared in the shadows now victoria and ned turned they too strolled toward the doorway neds arm was around her waist victorias arm was over neds shoulder david could imagine under victorias fingers the sleekness of the rayon shirt the hardness of neds swelling muscles he could feel under neds fingers the narrowness of her waist the ridges of her ribs and as his hand moved upward the softness of her breast they were on the steps of the building ned pulled victoria closer to him she did not resist they moved together into the shadows david was trembling he hated ned he hated victoria he would fight ned he would punch him to ribbons victoria victoria why have you done this to me why have you betrayed me you are no good you are cheap easy no why blame victoria you are a fool how did you know she liked you what made you think she was yours how can you compete against ned what do you have to offer the book of poetry which he had been clutching slipped from his hand he picked up the book through the window came a peal of laughter from victoria he flung the book down on the blanket with a sob it was black dark now too dark to read
drcrawford has a fifty dollar name for my ailment being incapable of using small numbers or symbols other than dollar signs he labels my trouble hysteria realizing psychiatrists thrive upon mysticism and words i insisted a broken water pump caused the entire mess but this mercenary medical guardian employed by my wife prohibits my leaving this place before coming to grips with reality upon explaining my recent misbehavior to the doctor i may merit a furlough so each day by talking into the tape recordercost fifty dollars a weeki hope to convince the doctors of my ability this taped therapy they term orally catalyzed mental catharsis but i recall confession at old st marys was less expensive that is another part of my problem which began quite simply the water pump burst without warning it was embarrassing driving through our quiet suburb with the car rattling like tin cans so i caught the bus the ride brought a return of pleasant childhood memories bus number  traversed the old neighborhood where very little had changed music shrieked from a few more taverns and smoke belched from numerous barbque houses but basically objects appeared familiar the trip was invigorating realizing new perspective might be gained i decided to ride the number  all week the fiftyfirst street elevated line was a bustling transfer point in this highly segregated city the station became an oasis of integration cosmopolitan life converged at the doors focused on bulging buses and l trains then dispersed in a cacophony of organized confusion one figure remained unchanged amid this turmoil each morning a man holding a magazine high repeated everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die this sage comment attracted my attention and that of other bustling transferees risking a glance i noticed the cover displayed a tall slender  bearded man wearing flowing robes the thick halo surrounding his head found its light quickly absorbed by a brown face even workers soured by the necessity of rising before dawn smiled sweetly at the inference that our lord was a negro brown and white faces transmitted smiles across racial barriers mutely judging this representation ludicrous they proceeded toward train connections that night my wife lucy little league star billy and five year old daughter sharon laughed as we discussed the funny man with the magazines lucy suggested i purchase a copy to show neighbors believing race relations to be strained sufficiently we decided the suggestion was inopportune in retrospect i recall no one ever bought a copy of the bearded mans magazine next day the fellow was present at the station which was obviously his regular post that second night during dessert the family joked about the black jesus man then little sharon dropped the bomb daddy she gulped pulverizing a strawberry suppose jesus were a negro children can say the funniest things and i smiled all the way to the office after that remark the third day conditions were the same but now i studied the faces of the passersby since the same people used this transfer point by midweek they had grown accustomed to the salesman i detected few smiles and wondered if other sharons had introduced doubt in other minds on succeeding mornings i evaluated the faces noting the expressions varied between mirth resentment and confusion by friday the resentful group owned my allegiance sharon didnt help showing us copies of dusky semites and displaying dark faces from her religious story books my daughter seemed to enjoy our mounting discomfort to avoid censure she amended her queries by purring might christ be partly negro with the arrival of sunday the joke had gotten less humorous i decided to buy the silly magazine planning to refute each argument the salesman wasnt there that night a voice reiterating everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die precipitated nightmares fortunately the car was available then followed my mistake in visiting young omalley at the parish rectory the reverend father sensing distress encouraged me to speak my excessively tense voice startled even me as i blurted could christ have been black after a few moments hesitation the priest answered truculently why not surprised by the brevity of his reply i snorted fiercely thats a hell of an answer and steamed toward the door calming me with an apology father explained god the father of all could conceivably send his son as a blend of all men since each of us needed redemption i got out of there fast on the way through the church it happened glimpsing the communion rail the thought struck next time i go to communion ill be swallowing the body and blood of a nigger hurrying to the public library i checked out several books on social customs during biblical times but i couldnt summon the courage to read them havent been to church since lucy made me promise to visit the psychiatrist the night i almost slapped little sharon for asking to go for a ride on the number  bus this damn recorder is almost out of tape one last thing must a man be called insane who buys six hundred new water pumps
randma looked at the clock and shook r her head in disbelief she had about an hour left before grandpa came down he was always on time you could set your watch by him hed be down this morning at seven she smiled that mans like a rock strong and always there she stacked all the ash trays on the drain board their dark stained bottoms gave off a heavy odor that suddenly made her ill she thought she still saw the white clouds of smoke hanging over the table but they were gone she opened the window picking up a newspaper she fanned in the sooted morning air she remembered the time there wasnt much left the table cloth had been white enough for a tv ad but that was over twelve hours ago now it was spotted with coffee cigarette ashes liquor and handshands that had been rubbing across its fibers hands wiped on it and hands cold with perspiration nervously fingering and palming it as they waited the turn of chance the table cloth came off then the blanketpadding ill have to use a lot of bleach to get this one clean she mused she didnt like to use too much bleach not good for the cloth tears it to pieces she wiped the oak table clean she liked her oak table it was old and warm its grain was wide open stained a little but warm and well used she never believed in using a table cloth she liked the wood too much she found herself thinking about too much this morning guess im getting old cant seem to think about what i should be about whats the use of covering up this wood just being here means youre going to get a little soiled whats a few stains i like to look at some things and know that theyve been used and loved guess thats all because ive been here so long she set a place for paul his large cup was to the left of his plate his fork knife and teaspoon were to the left also after the first six months of their marriage shed learned to set the table right for him margie her friend had washed the dishes god there was plenty of them shed had a big crowd there last night more than shed had for a long time twentyfive pounds of ribs forty pounds of chittlins a mess of coldslaw and bread had all disappeared there was no telling about the coffee think i had about five pounds theyd eaten more than shed thought yet something against all her reason had told her to buy a lot this time cant go wrong when you listen to yourself she sat down for a while her legs were tired an aching tiredness that seemed to be creeping up into her thighs lucky the kitchens a good size id never be able to handle a crowd like this if it was one of them small ones she was up again she put the shoeshine box beside his chair at the table she stood tall almost stretching but too tired to try it she noticed her feet sliding across the floor she didnt have the strength to lift them but to mattie it seemed as if her large heavy frame belonged to someone else feeling somewhat distant and uninvolved in this worn out tired fat hulk she moved about doing what she had to do the hot water was on eggs bacon grits and toast the toast had to be done lightly grandpa didnt like his toast burnt and didnt like it done in one of those machines either she put three slices of bread in a tin pan and slid it into the broiler maybe i got high blood pressure maybe i ought to go on a diet i shore do tire easily now but you just cant stop a game because youre tired you got to let them play had to stop them early in the first place aint never goin to have him come down on a game know how he feels and thats that his wants come first thats that her breast hung lower than usual this morning they were at her waist line she looked down at herself it was an impersonal and curious examination remember the time when you were something to look at look at you now my god lucky you got a man you sure couldnt get one now not even a old one fact is you couldnt get a dead one the grits were boiling shed wait a few minutes before putting the biscuits in the oven she wanted them to be hot for him thats how he liked them shed done real well this weekend she hadnt counted her take but she knew that shed done better than anybody else in the neighborhood her players were more than gamblers they were her friends they came and kept coming she smiled if youre goin to do somethin you might as well do it right im proud of my games theyre the best round thats fact theres no gettin around it either she couldnt understand jims boy hed been there last night mattie had always liked him in fact she still did what happened last night hadnt changed that but she just couldnt understand him trying to pull one over on her he shouldve known better theyd run through all her new decks all she had was five new  decks on hand five had always been more than enough but not last night no last night some had a run of good luck but some had a run of bad luck too good luck and bad luck always seemed to run together its just a question of what side of the coins facing up or going to fall when luck is running bad some of the players would try anything cleaning their glasses sitting tight and motionless as their hearts almost burst through their chests with the fall of each card drinking coffee by the pot others whiskey without ever showing it calling for new decks as though all the other decks theyd touched during the night were cursed or worse alive with hatred for them shed watched her players over the years she knew them and they knew her she didnt argue with them about their ways not even when some of them got loud and cursed a bit too much she just didnt want them to wake paul up and they didnt they seemed to remember that he was upstairs and quiet down sometimes shed have to give one of them a look thats all it would take her players were one big family they were her children her brothers and sisters yet mattie often wondered about her saturdavrelatives the quiet knowing that each had about the other bluff was impossible each knew the other too well more than their money and time they brought their innermost selves to the round oak table and a bit of each was placed with each bet and a bit lost with each pot the winnings never seemed to balance things out they were always looking for those bits and scraps that got away the last time mattie had seen it all happen even to herself theyd all grown old around the oak table each came and humbly offered himself to the game hoping for a sign an omen a bit of luck after all the psychology and odds had been stretched to the end fate spoke the final word so they played each saturday using their skills of a lifetime knowing how little they counted without lucks blessings mattie as well as the rest knew something else they loved the game and loved to challenge and prick the lady perhaps to force her smile her blessing how could jims boy know anything about their saturdays their game had everything to do with living nothing to do with winning but winning was important too just how would you explain all this to a young boy    you just dont because you cant mattie sent jims boy to buy five new decks he was younger than the rest of the players but he was jims boy they played several hands then jim noticed the white borders on the back of the cards some of the borders were thicker in places jim snatched the cards from the table and thew them against the wall his hands were quick and one lashed noisily across his sons cheek the boy left jim was mad his anger hung heavy over the table stilling and stiffening the players sarah bless her she started talking fast soon everybody was listening sarahs words had buried the boys cheating it was just nonsensetalk at first then she got quiet and started up again it was about her marti her daughter i know people are talking about her it aint true either shes just developed fast thats all shes goin to marry ralph hes her age aint nothin to all the talk about ed why hes twice her age and a lot more aint nothin to it there was just the betting and faces naked and still staring at the table i dont know what to do this things ripping my insides out god the heads raised and the faces looked at sarah she breathed hard i pass big bill spoke up next it aint easy livin ill take two cards it aint easy tryin to make it but we just keep tryin sarah lifes like a bad joke you hear for the first time sometimes the more you think about it the funnier it gets well the more you think about livin the funnier it gets but it just dont get funny until you get some of it behind you then you can laugh then it seems like youve always been a child doin and thinkin childish things then its funny real funny and the jokes been on you but too much thinking had gone by paul was coming down mattie waited paul grunted his mornin there was a twinkle in his eyes mattie smiled at her old man he was short just a bit shorter than mattie his thin wrinkled brown frame was straight he moved slowly and unsteadily but with a tall pride he brushed his shoes and at the same time he looked her kitchen over mattie tried to walk without limping or dragging her feet the pain was still there and still hurt when she moved but it didnt hurt anymore when she walked it just made it hard for her to walk paul watched but said nothing he polished his old cracked shoes mattie had tried for years to get him to polish his shoes before he got dressed he never would so shed always put the shoeshine box next to his chair at the table she still didnt like it he always managed to get a little shoe polish on his white cuffs or socks but shed learned to live with his ways his brush strokes warmed the shoes to a bright shine he looked for his rag a few beads of water and the rag then the black leather would raise a shine like glass in the sun he looked at his right heel the rubber on the outside was almost down to the leather mattie sat opposite her husband his hands were a bit shaky as he pushed his butter into the biscuit slowly he went about his eating it was a serious business with him she watched satisfied with his silent chewing and expressionless enjoyment theyd had a good life together  each had managed to stand tall and free of the other but theyd been together in their living she felt sad she remembered telling him some years ago how much she loved him and how good he was all this took place many years back during the time when she believed that everything had to be said he answered mattie youre the good one and once more the strong one i just got sense enough to know that i find my joy in what i know i mean what i know down deep about the both of us occasionally he looked at her his eyes smiled he wanted to speak to say something but he thought better of it mattie was breathing hard it looked as though her shoulders were pulling up her stomach in order to get air into her her eyes were red the long curly hair under her chin seemed longer sometime ago shed used the long black and gray hairs framing her forehead to cover the bald spot at the back of her head now the long black and grays in the front were fewer and no attempt was made to cover the back she just brushed it accepting in amazement what the years had done to her her jaws hung loose her neck and chin were one run of flesh disappearing into her chest paul stood and brushed off a few crumbs from his clothes with the back of his hand he rubbed most of the crumbs off his lips and chin mattie you dont look well ought to go back to bed you mustve had a fitfall night last night go on back to bed and rest some more plan to paul i plan to go back paul left slowly he walked down the street his head was low his blurred gaze followed the irregular cracks and ridges in the sidewalks he too felt tired hed wanted to say something to her but there was no way now too much too long had changed any talking about some things after all he hadnt been fair with her hed helped her in this game of theirs and couldnt go back on her now it meant too much to her mattie rested on the couch in the living room just a little sleep and ill be back strong again she thought of her man everybody loved paul he was a good man top deacon in the church he was a real christian everybody said so she even said so hed always been the same a good man shed respected him for that shed never do anything to harm or hurt him people just accepted her for what she was she loved her cards and couldnt take much of churches her paul wasnt like all the other christians he lived his religion she went to sleep    paul walked up the bridge over the railroad tracks and yard it was a harder and longer walk this morning but his pace was steady and shoulders high nothing seemed quite right this morning yet everything seemed right but in a different way although tired and weary inside his spirits felt light and free although his legs were heavy and troublesome to lift they felt young and vibrant he couldnt reconcile all these different feelings god he muttered you know i aint never professed to be nothin but what i am you know that ive always been just that and nothin else you know that too somehow i feel like some kind of imposter people just think im somethin that i aint i cant tell them what i am aint sure i know that i cant tell them how i feel either seems like if i told them the truth id hurt so many of them i dont like hurtin people you know that lord but im tired im tired of lettin them believe i dont think i can go on much longer pretendin i aint really pretendin lord but they treat me with so much respect for nothin just for nothin lord they think im so good because i just dont do nothin but that aint bein good lord you know and i know that a man that just dont do aint much sittin and bein aint bein good you got to tell them lord i dont think i can keep on with it he opened the front doors of the church for over the last thirty years he was the first one there on sunday morning at seven fortyfive each sunday morning he opened the doors the nightcooled air moved into the church with him the sun warmed the large doorway and brightened the center aisle usually paul dusted the pews and pulpit although he dusted yesterday evening he liked to go over everything just one more time with everybody coming in on sunday morning looking so nice he didnt want anyone to get dirty by coming to church today he felt a little too tired he sat on the deacons bench it was his bench theyd made him a deacon forty years ago hed been a deacon a long time he never did anything never said anything about how the church was run hed just been a deacon sometimes a praying or singing one he closed his eyes and took a nap hed feel a bit stronger after a while he was weary right now he still could see the sunlight making a warm path down the center aisle he couldnt really see it but his closed eye lids were bright and warm mattie tried to rest shed slept for less than an hour it was a worrisome time for her she couldnt help thinking about her paul yet she was the one ailing she started to get up but didnt sometimes bein strong is lettin other people be she wondered what paul had meant it didnt make too much sense to her her games were taking too much out of her she thought about giving them up but what would her saturdays be like she didnt need the money anymore there was nobody but her and paul the kids  were gone but she had her games it was her saturday nights she looked forward to them they meant everything to her without them she wondered what her life would be like everybody needs something she had her saturday nights paul went to bed so early on saturday night well he had to church was always on sunday sunday school the sunday morning service then the baptist young peoples union finally evening service paul needed all his rest for sunday she needed hers for saturday night didnt seem like she could quit she half hoped that hed find out about her games and tell her to quit itd be so easy for her then she wasnt quite sure that he didnt know or suspect but she did know that hed never said anything to her thats what counted hed never said a word when the two deacons knocked at the door she yelled come on in its open they stood over her her whole left side was on fire shed never hurt that way before but it was a funny thing for her to feel it it felt off in the distance it was almost as though it were happening to somebody else and every now and then she felt one of his pains she wondered who it was and what was wrong with him oddly enough she also felt that it didnt hurt as much as it could or even shouldve the pain was burning through her chest she looked down expecting to see her tiredflat bosom smouldering soon bursting into flame the tall one spoke first mattie it just happened so peacefully like we thought he was asleep we didnt know he was dying until the morning service just when the preacher took his text he fell off the bench he tried to say something about a game i dont think i understand exactly i think it was something about a game she came to once she stared from behind the plastic oxygen tent and smiled
