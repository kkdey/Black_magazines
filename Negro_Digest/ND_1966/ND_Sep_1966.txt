e deeply appreciate y wjsj £ the honor that deyv  volves upon us at the  § first world festival   of negro arts to welcome so many talents from the four continents from the four horizons of the spirit but what honors us most of all and what constitutes your greatest merit is the fact that you will have participated in an undertaking much more revolutionary than the exploration of the cosmos the elaboration of a new humanism which this time will include the totality of humanity on the planet earth senegal welcomes you therefore as distinguished guests and first of all dakar greets you thus fulfilling its mission for dakar a black plowshare cast in the fertile ocean has always answered the call of the tradewinds and welcomed visitors arriving by sea or by air thus we can enter into a dialogue the mainspring of civilizations or at any rate of culture here we are here you are assembled ethnologists and sociologists historians and linguists writers and artists your task will be to seek out to spell out the junction of negro art in the life of the black man the function or rather the signs but basically you will probe beyond those signs to discover their meaning today more modestly as an old militant of nigritude i should like to say less about the function and meaning of negro artwhich i have tried to treat elsewherethan about the function and significance that we senegalese attribute to this first world festival of negro arts in a word if we have assumed the terrible responsibility of organizing this festival it is for the defense and illustration of nigritude for people are continuing here and there throughout the world to deny african art as well as negritude by which i mean the negro values of civilization and when they can no longer deny negro art because it is so evident they try to contest its originality its human truth african art has been denied on the pretext that it presents different forms and in fact if it is indeed an entity it is in the diversity of its fields its types even its styles like european art which under its italian french german russian or swedish appearance derives from grecolatin civilization from discursive reason animated by christianity like european art which subjected to frequent revolutions nevertheless remains european in its fundamental characteristics to return to african art it is all the more a unit because if its function is always to actualize its object i mean its matter its nature on the contrary is always to express this object by means of the same signs in the same profound style which is precisely to stylize it as a result one can not long deny negro art because the europeans themselves were the first to discover and to define itthe negro africans preferred to live it the most eminent european artists and writers defended it from pablo picasso to andre malraux whose presence here i salute as conclusive evidence and i need not speak about the african and american negro writers and artists who between the two world wars and since  have won the attention of a world torn apart and which because it was tom asunder was seeking its unity its authenticity unable then to deny negro art they have tried to minimize its originality claiming that it had no monopoly either over emotion or over the analogical image not even over the rhvthm and it is true that every genuine artist has these gifts whatever his continent his race his nation may be nevertheless rimbaud had to claim kinship with negritude picasso had to be overwhelmed by a baoule mask apollinaire had to sing of wooden fetishes before western european art would consent after two thousand years to abandon physeds mimesis the imitation of nature it is in large measure the fault of negro arta very fortunate fruitful faultthat the artists of that same western world are inspired today like bazaine by the kmost obscure effort of instinct and sen sitivity and that like masson they define the work of art as a simple play of forms and values that are legibly organized in brief a simply rhythm a play of forces my friend soulages would have said because rhythm is harmonious movement in that it signifies forms but it is not only a question of defending the negro art of the past as it is exhibited today in the musee dynamique it is even more a matter of making it illustrious by showing what it is in the middle of the twentieth century a gusher that does not run dry a basic significant element of the civilization of the universal which is being constructed before our eyes by us and for us by all and for all and first of all for the negro writers and artists as is evidenced by the exposition of contemporary art which bears the meaningful title tendencies and confrontation and so after the first and then the second world war from everywhereafrica america and the very heart of europeyoung black men and girls have risen like young trees pruned by those two wars from the depth of their ancestral experiences from the depth of their more recent experiences as slaves and as colonized people or simply as men of this century wide open to all contributions they have discovered along with a new vision of the world the new words of the new negro words that they provided their works did not need to be placed in anthologies or in museums to fulfill that function which is to express life to represent it so as to help men all men to live better to help their black brothers before all others think of the former black slaves of america deported from mother africa if they did not surrender to the taedium vitae tedium of life if they did not give up like other races destined to die in weak sorrowful languor it was because they had carried within them from the motherland along with the lust for life that creative power which is the original trademark of art for art is nothing other than this primal gesture of homo sapiens thinking man who representing life by the symbolic image intensifies it by rhythm thus magnifying it to give it the value of eternity such at least is negro art and to refer again to the negro americans the art of negro spirituals and the blues the most ordinary labor of the peasant the most painful labor of the slave vivified because it is magnified by the word by the song by the dance by the rhythmic energy which is the very stuff of life but slavery belongs to the past today in senegal to take a current example the new national art rooted in the black basalt of cap vert is being built up once again in dakar a crossroads swept by all the pollens in the world as well as by images and ideas saving us from despair this negro art sustains us in our effort toward economic and social development in our determination to live so too do our poets short story writers and novelists our singers and dancers our painters and sculptors our musicians whether they paint violent mystical abstractions or the noble elegance of royal african courtships whether they sculpt the national lion or fantastic monsters whether they dance the development plan or sing the diversification of crops the negro african artists the senegalese artists of today help us to live today to live a better more abundant life to live more that is to say more intensely reinforcing the high tension that characterized the north suda  nese negro african civilization to live better in order to resolve the concrete problems that condition our future listening to me one might believe that negro art is only a technique an ensemble of means at the service of a civilization of the comfortable or in any case at the service of material production let me explain i have spoken not merely of economic growth but of development that is to say the correlative and complementary totality of matter and spirit of the economic and social of the body and the soul i have spoken at the same time of the production of material goods and spiritual goods when i speak of negritude i am referring to a civilization where art is at once technique and vision handicraft and prophecy where art expresses in the words of ogotemmeli the identity of material gestures and spiritual forces the same aged negro said the other day the weaver sings as he pushes his shuttle and his voice continues the chain aiding and leading the chant of the ancestors this means simply that all art in black africa weaving sculpture painting music and danceis speech or better still the wrd  mean poetry in fact form and colors timbres and tones movement even the materials used by the artists have the effectiveness of the word provided they are rhythmic for speech having become the word because it has the rhythm of the primeval movement the form of things named recreates them makes them more present more true thus it accomplishes the action of the creator because by renewing that action it prolongs it by art which once again eternizes the life of things and beings by vivifying and magnifying that life beyond its vital function this is the significance of negro art it makes us resemble god by having us participate in its creation i have almost finished by helping the defense and illustration of negro art senegal is conscious of helping to build the civilization of the universal in fact even before our national independence during the past twenty years or so we have never stopped basing our policy on dialogue in all fields and essentially in the realm of culture for culture is the first requisite and the final objective of all development but to dialogue with others to take part in the common work of conscientious determined men who springing up everywhere in the world to bring new values to the symbiosis of complementary values by which the civilization of the universal is determined we negroes need to be ourselves at long last in our dignity our regained identity to be ourselves by cultivating our own values as we have rediscovered them in the sources of negro art because those values spring from biological geographical and historical data they are over and beyond the profound unity of humanity the hallmark of our originality in thought feeling and action to be ourselves not without borrowing not by procuration but rather by our own personal and collective effort and for ourselves otherwise we should merely be poor copies of others in the musee vivant as the negroes of america were in slavery days until the end of the nineteenth century just as we african negroes were in the days of colonization until the eve of the second world war between the two world wars what the young black men and girls of my generation wanted was to abandon the imitative spirit of the old regime to regain along with the sentiment of our dignity the creative spirit which had been for thousands of years the seal of negritude as revealed by the rupestrian art of the african continent we meant to become once again producers of civilization like our ancestors for we were conscious of the fact that the humanism of the twentieth century which can only be the civilization of the universal would be impoverished if it excluded a single continent once again the problem is posed in terms of complementarity of dialogue and interchange not of opposition or racial hatred moreover how could we negroes reject the scientific and technical discoveries of the european and north american peoples thanks to those discoveries man is seen transforming man himself as well as nature ladies and gentlemen you researchers and professors artists and writers are the real humanists of the present day because senegal has chosen to be the fatherland of dialogue and interchange senegal wishes to be your second country in any event it hopes that the great dialogue that begins here today will contribute to the construction of the earth to the fulfilment of man
in the november  issue of ramparts magazine james baldwin is quoted in an editorial as saying that he could not   accept the proposition that the yearold travail of the american negro should result in the attainment of the present level of american civilization    white people cannot in the generality be taken as models of how to live rather the white man is himself in sore need of new standards it would be absurd to challenge this excerpted critique with the contention that baldwin has failed to understand the best values of the establishment the charge most often leveled at social critics it is quite apparent from his work that baldwin understands america only all too wellfar better in fact than do most members of the establishment these same men who disparage his writings would do well to read him closely for the full reality behind baldwins remarks is that the present movement toward accepting the negro into american life is predicated on a maintenance of the traditional white status quo an attitude that implicity assumes its values to be supremely desirable a movement that willin a moment of boundless magnanimityallow the negro to elevate himself to babbitts height if he proves himself worthy enough this attitude is absolutely intolerable it embodies the very essence of white supremacy it must be discarded immediately and a new orientation substituted before it condemns the nation to political and social disaster the arrogance of the wasp establishments selfrighteous condescension in legislating what it has convinced itself is the passionate striving of the negro to be at one with the great white society must be halted at once this belief presumes that its holder has nothing to learn from the negro while the negropoor bedeviled black that he ishas the world to gain by taking communion of the new barbarisms god technos well just whose world will he gain duponts dean rusks the planned though obsolete world of general motors the world of los angeles police chief parker lest the reader think these concerns are solitary ones that they pertain to a few problem areas in the south only and not to northern cities that have no problem let us look at william stringfellows book my people is the enemy his conclusions derive from his years of work in harlem as legal counsel for the poor he found that the political recognition which negroes have so far received    has been    purchased by the surrender of their identity and integrity as negroes although stringfellow is    as much in favor of social change in the urban ghettoes as the next perhaps more he remains    by no means persuaded that the standard of social improvement should be that of the great american bourgeoisie americas long history of race war and a biracial culture culminating in the violent emotions of watts should have brought the realization that our course of behavior was neither adequate nor equal to needs one would reasonably assume that having come via watts to sudden national awareness that a very real problem still exists this most pragmatic of nations would now create a mode of reconciliation more realistic more just this has not been the case as slick papers are turned out by professional social workers and cityappointed commissions the reality of violent revolution grows more valid more appealing daily while the most elaborate sophistry is used to justify the selfinterests of local and national power structures and the churches must be included still another summer approaches in its coming heat we may witness a watts in every major city outside the south by the edicts and terms in current usage among the administration one sees there an awareness that a problem exists perversely and predictably it is interpreted as the negro problem rather than as a recent issue of ebony saw it as the white problem of america instead of modifying the environment and content of american life creating a viable culture for all the negro along with his fellow nonwhite will be made over until he suits the economic and governmental intents and purposes he is to serve the national policy to date had been one of massive containment of the negro outside the mainstream of american life this tactic having obviously even embarrassingly failed the strategy has now evolved into one of containment through controlled absorption since we couldnt lick them goes this reasoning let us lure them into the same boat were in moving to the back of course and convince them that our battle is theirs also while i have reservations as to the feasibility of this theory it will probably be accepted by the powersthatbe for it seems to have been worked out on the same computer by the same people who created our china policy nuclear defense notions vietnamese war games anticommunism programs etc it will be used by the empowered until some bright randy young man comes up with a better solution now this is all very fine and good but for this to succeed we must all metamorphisize into creatures whose eyes are able to transform all black into white the negro has never indicated any desire to be made white incidentally may i ask just what is wrong with his blackness we are determined to ramrod a  white bill of rights down the negros throat while he is still choking on watts but even as great a task as the resolving of race relations is it is incapable of solution until the central problem of western lifeepitomized in americais successfully confronted we have yet to come to terms with the economic facts of life in a rapidly transitional society a society which has not static stability as its goal but the assimilation of constant flux where individual immersion in change is a way of life and an ability to cope will mark ones status thanks to a hundred years of an imposed cultural lag the negro and tens of millions of other citizens are the victims twiceover of a technology and productive system that penalizes them for the deprivation they have suffered under it it is now claimed that through massive applications of education and relearning programs we can create a citizen who fits into the new society but the intrinsic promise of technology coupled with the rate of development is so rapidly expanding that it is very likely all the crash efforts in the world will not avert huge unemployment to say nothing of further alienation from society such as it is disregarding the what and how of quantity and quality our production systems are running under capacity now while new operations and applied science demands maximum efficiency and output at all levels as private corporations continue to bloat in size and dwindle in number while refusing to regulate the quantity and quality of production or reevaluate its scheme of goals the economy will continue to haphazardly spiral upwards on the charts dependent on the paper tigers of war and waste to maintain high growth rates not molded or educated in the context of an exceedingly complex industrial society the minorities have poured into the cities only to find urban monsters in process of decay as decent living areas tens of millions look on as wealth which they have helped to accrue concentrates and accumulates above them they find they have no voice in the direction or quality of their life yet they live in a nation that will conscript them to die in support of their deprivation youth in anxious rebellion and desperate attempts at selfassertion finding few provisions for creative alternatives turns to drugs violence reactionary conservatism and a hypnotic militarism if these responses are frowned upon what other choices are available in a society that punishes with unbelievable cruelty their efforts at free speech free press free assembly we are just now beginning to pay the price of corporate free enterprise as it is carried out to its selfdefeating ends if the spring is to return to our year then it must be preceeded by a new coordination of national and individual purposes a complete revision of existing laws to be fol lowed by ones that are uniformly regulated and enforced a strict adherence to equality before the law for every person regardless of age and a restoration of participative democracy in an electoral system that has real and meaningful choices not merely an exchanging of administrators within the monolith of bureaucracy   ?   perhaps the most amazing aspect of the chaos that is modern american life is the simultaneous existence of agencies and abilities capable of effective reform alongside the most incredible disregard of such opportunities why are they going unheeded the students for a democratic society and the student nonviolent coordinating committee are only two of the agencies for social reform that have risen from the people to meet the peoples needs the growing third party movements the black_panther the freedom democratic party are hopeful elements of correction making their influence felt at the state and local seats of government in the cities especially we have witnessed long overdue corrections come about because of grassroots activism not only are activists and intellectuals available personally by the hundreds but the networks of communications are greater than ever with important variations and differences a deluge of new magazines and journals has brought people everywhere into contact unheard of previously new styles of writing encourage feelings of bondedness even as television confirms the brotherhood of men however distant talented and gifted men are everywhere but in the determining positions of the administration or so their attitudes suggest it is tragically grim to wonder if perhaps a rash of wattses are needed to stir the slumbering washingtonians and america at large in the schools and churches what awareness has trickled down to their participants has been opposed if not eliminated by administration usually for fear of fomenting a revolt from the desks and pews but good god could anything be more fearful than a watts in every city in the land even the ones that have no problem people said voltaire deserve the kind of government they have are we to be historys fools serving only to vindicate voltaires wit the phrases and intonations that one hears are those of consensus and concern for opinion and unanimity words whose contents settle all too easily into complacency smug assurance of right and wrong and finally a cheap fascism of the center we are pursuing a resolution of self cast in such unreal forms that we now stand in grave danger of losing what we most would save our souls    not only in the theological sense but in the existential religious meaning also by making  available no alternative in the direction or quality of life other than that of mr and mrs babbitt living on new main st in megalopolis usa we are well on the way to culminate in the ultimate consumer culture where a man is the last entry in the biggest bookkeeping operation ever made america to relegate the negro to his proper place as a black cog alongside his fellow white cog in a nationmachine seems to be our national and economic predestination we metaphysic that integrated machines run more efficiently more smoothly more profitably sign seen in business office recently of southern corporation integration pays it is my passionate hope that neither of these cogs comes to pass the warnings of marx dostoyevsky huxley fromm and others have been made and should prove sufficient to right reason and right sentiment to refuse to accept the negros contribution and to refuse to accord him respect for himself is to precipitate disaster i do not believe there is a mystique of negritude or that the negros blackness will magically save us but to eradicate him as if he had never existed which according to most american history texts he never has except for being central to the civil war while bleaching him white will be the last sin of our history does manregardless of his colorhave to become the final unit in a national consuming machine must we push the negro into roles that we are unhappy in ourselves perhaps our misery wishing for company of numbers to alleviate it our national motto should be miseria concordia certainly if anything is to be done to stop this pernicious drift living in an atmosphere of gradualism and detached noninvolvement are not among them wake up dear hearts days of crisis will not be long upon us no matter how we approach it our future nationally and individually is inseparably bound to that of the negro and other minorities the dominant life values of the wasp hive and their attendant social heirarchy must undergo a total reordering we must free ourselves to direct our lives in a sounder healthier manner or we shall persist in the antisocial unloving unkind behavior that has brought chaos into our nation our cities our hearts watts need never happen again if it does it will mean that good men have not been allowed to prevail for the answers we so desperately call for and the means to achieve democratic goals are now with us we have only to make use of them we must engage in a reciprocal relationship with the negro not as negro but as human beings careful to keep that relating alive and quick else we again become as rigid and unrealistic as dead in our hearts and souls as the damnable relationship of our past that there will be profound consequences even unforeseen ones is an ineluctable conclusion what matters most is that we remain positive and open to change change which we must seek to understand not fear though we cannot legislate morality we can create the environment that nurtures and sustains moral relationships to paraphrase the opening sentence of woodwards the strange career of jim crow the people of america should be the last to expect indefinite continuity of their institutions and social arrangements to ignore the negros very real identity and assets is to ignore all humanity to neglect and even betray the heart and vision of what democracy is to mean in america
mark twain said effect that when country enslaves people the first necpessary job is to make the world feel that the people to enslaved are subhuman the to make his fellowbe next job is countrymen believe that man is inferior and then the unkindest cut of all is to make that man believe himself inferior a good job has been done on the black people in this country as far as convincing them of their inferiority is concerned the general white community has told us in a million different ways and in no uncertain terms that god and nature made a mistake when it came to the fashioning of us and ours the whole society having been thoroughly convinced of the stained threatening and evil nature of anything unfortunate enough to be or referred to as black as an intended matter of courtesy refers to those of african extraction as colored or negro the fact that negro is the spanish word for black is hardly understood it would seem or it would seem that the word black may be intimated or suggested but never simply stated in good english too many negroes if described or referred to as black take it as an affront and i was once told by a canadian irishman that id insulted him by referring to my person as a black woman he insisted that in actuality i was brown not black and i felt obliged to tell him he described himself as white and that he wasnt white either the fact that white people readily and proudly call themselves white glorify all that is white and whitewash all that is glorified becomes unnatural and bigoted in its intent only when these same whites deny persons of african heritage who are black the natural and inalienable right to readily and proudly call themselves black glorify all that is black and blackwash all that is glorified yet one is forced to conclude that this is not the case at all that an astonishing proportion of the white population finds it discomforting that blacks should dare to feel so much glory in being beautifully black in the face of this kind of reasoning the only conclusion one can logically come to is that there is something wrong with this society and its leadership the mans opinion of god is sorry to put it nicely and his opinion of himself is simply vague and hazy consider swearing his love and devotion to the omnipotent one on the one hand yet defying and cursing him with rank impudence on the other using the crutch of his inherently base and callow nature on the one hand and claiming his godhood on the other worshipping a jew as the son of god on the one hand yet persecuting all other jews as enemies of god on the other historically placing this same jew on the african continent on the one hand and describing him as a european in physical appearance on the other still one would suppose that its tacitly understood by all that god couldnt be anything other than white no matter where he was bom advocating that the black man is made of inferior stuff on the one hand yet defying him not to prove his superiority on the other naming hurricanes for women on the one hand yet h is for the heart as pure as gold on the other giving her pet names such as whore slut bitch etc on the one hand yet put them all together and they spell mother the word that means the world to me on the other no wonder the slogan white is right could take a whole nation by storm one could never accuse this society of being rational still instead of this irrational society warping my delicate little psyche it only drove me ultimately to the conclusion that any black human being able to survive the horrendous and evil circumstances in which one inevitably finds oneself trapped must be some kind of a giant with great and peculiar abilities with an armor as resistant as steel yet made of purest gold my mother is one of the most courageous people i have ever known with an uncanny will to survive when she was a young woman the white folks were much further in the lead than they are now and their racist rules gave her every disadvantage yet she proved herself a queen among women any women and as a result will always be one of the great legends for me but strange as it is ive heard it echoed by too many black full grown males that black woman hood is the downfall of the black man in that she the black woman is evil hard to get along with domineering suspicious and narrowminded in short a black ugly evil you know what as time progresses ive learned that this description of my mothers sisters and partners in crime is used as the basis and excuse for the further shoving by the black man of his own head into the sand of oblivion hence the black mother housewife and allaround girl thursday is called upon to suffer both physically and emotionally every humiliation a woman can suffer and still function her head is more regularly beaten than any other womans and by her own man shes the scapegoat for mr charlie she is forced to stark realism and chided if caught dreaming her aspirations for her and hers are for sanitys sake stunted her physical image has been criminally maligned assaulted and negated shes the first to be called ugly and never yet beautiful and as a consequence is forced to see her man an exact copy of her emotionally and physically brainwashed and wallowing in selfloathing pick for his own the physical antithesis of her the white woman and incubator of his heretofore arch enemy the white man then to add guilt to insult and injury she the black woman stands accused as the emasculator of the only thing she has ever cared for her black man accused by her black man she is the scapegoat for what white america has made of the negro personality raped and denied the right to cry out in her pain she has been named the culprit and called loose hotblooded wanton sultry and amoral she has been used as the white mans sexual outhouse and shamefully encouraged by her own egoless man to persist in this function wanting too to be carried away by her prince charming she must in all honesty admit that he has been robbed of his crown by the very assaulter and assassin who has raped her still she looks upon her man as gods gift to black womanhood and is further diminished and humiliated and outraged when the feeling is not mutual when a white man likes colored girls his woman the white woman is the last one he wants to know about it yet seemingly when a negro likes white girls his woman the black woman is the first he wants to know about it white female rejects and social misfits are flagrantly flaunted in our faces as the ultimate in feminine pulchritude our women are encouraged by our own men to strive to look and act as much like the white female image as possible and only those who approach that goal in physical appearance and social behavior are acceptable at best we are made to feel that we are poor imitations and excuses for white women evil evil you say the black woman is hurt confused frustrated angry resentful frightened and evil who in this hell dares suggest that she should be otherwise these attitudes only point up her perception of the situation and her healthy rejection of same maybe if our women get evil enough and angry enough theyll be moved to some action that will bring our men to their senses there is one unalterable fact that too many of our men cannot seem to face and that is we black evil ugly women are a perfect and accurate reflection of you black evil ugly men play hide and seek as long as you can and will but your every rejection and abandonment of us is only a sorry testament of how thoroughly and carefully you have been blinded and brainwashed and let it further be understood that when we refer to you we mean ultimately us for you are us and vice versa we are the women who were kidnapped and brought to this continent as slaves we are the women who were raped are still being raped and our bastard children snatched from our breasts and scattered to the winds to be lynched castrated deegoed robbed burned and deceived we are the women whose strong and beautiful black bodies were and arestill being used as a cheap labor force for miss annes kitchen and mr charlies bed whose rich black and warm milk nurtured and still nurturesthe heir to the racist and evil slavemaster we are the women who dwell in the hellhole ghettos all over this land we are the women whose bodies are sacrificed as living cadavers to experimental surgery in the white mans hospitals for the sake of white medicine we are the women who are invisible on the television and movie screens on the broadway stage we are the women who are lusted after sneered at leered at hissed at yelled at grabbed at tracked down by white degenerates in our own pitiable poverty stricken and prideless neighborhoods we are the women whose hair is compulsively fried whose skin is bleached whose nose is too big whose mouth is too big and loud whose behind is too big and broad whose feet are too big and flat whose face is too black and shiny and whose suffering and patience is too long and enduring to be believed whos just too damned much for everybody we are the women whose bars and recreation halls are invaded by flagrantly disrespectful bigoted simpering amoral emotionally unstable outcast maladjusted nymphomaniacal condescending white women  in desperate and untiring search of the exceedingly outsized black penis that will be attached to the animalistic frothingatthemouthforawhitewoman strongbacked sixtyminute hot black our men we are the women who upon protesting this invasion of our privacy and sanctity and sanity are called jealous and evil and smallminded and prejudiced we are the women whose husbands and fathers and brothers and sons have been plagiarized imitated denied and robbed of the fruits of their genius and who consequently we see emasculated jailed lynched driven mad deprived enraged and made suicidal we are the women who nobody seemingly cares about who are made to feel inadequate stupid and backward and who inevitably have the most colossal inferiority complexes to be found and who is spreading the propaganda that the only free people in this country are the white man and the black woman if this be freedom then heaven is hell right is wrong and cold is hot who will revere the black woman who will keep our neighborhoods safe for black innocent womanhood black womanhood is outraged and humiliated black womanhood cries for dignity and restitution and salvation black womanhood wants and needs protection and keeping and holding who will assuage her indignation who will keep her precious and pure who will glorify and proclaim her beautiful image to whom will she cry rape
the racist leaves us no doubt he is the enemy he hides behind no beautiful words of welcome while holding the door shut with his toe should we choose to physically fight governor wallace would give us no doubt as to who should be struck with the weapon he is my enemy the enemy of my children and friends    and i respect his candor he keeps us awake and alert my introduction to hypocrisy and prejudice came simultaneously my father took my brothers and i each day to the catholic school in town this was before the prestige of suburban living we were farmers we were poor perhaps this is why i was drawn to another classmate who was different although i didnt think about it then i only knew that i liked her and that she liked me she didnt poke fun when the others teased me because i obviously owned only two dresses we sheltered each other when a section of the class hooted as we stated firmly that there was too a santa claus    catholic universal allinclusive having broad sympathies or understanding liberal first grade in a catholic school in a kansas town we learned that god loves everyone we worship god by acts of faith hope and charity thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself man is a creature composed of body and soul and made to the image and likeness of god sister didnt mention that we loved our neighbor only if he looked just like we did we were told that charity was in part being kind to others our church had numbers on the pews a number for each family one sunday i spied my friend already seated in the pew with her family i genuflected as all good catholics do and sat with christine    eight years old and we learned that we should have read between the lines our teacher a nun the principal a nun and the parish priest brought me to the office the next morning christine wasnt there but they explained to me that nice little girls did not sit with the negroes the negroes have their own pews with numbers all in the back of this catholic church all grouped together dont you want the other children to like you little girl i hated them they made me feel dirty they made me feel guilty i cried christine had never made me feel guilty even when we sometimes fought she had never made me feel dirty as we walked around the school yard with our arms about each others waists as little girls do the first lesson  we were friends in the school yard and grew closer when my family later moved to town but we never again sat together in church in  kansas integrated the schools it was no longer necessary for the negro children to walk many blocks passing one or two public schools to get to their own separate but equal school but the catholic parish had shown its benevolence many years before   it had christine by the time we reached high school my associations had pretty well ostracized me from the white cliques but the catholic high school had made great strides here we had three negroes    boys    football stars we were not brave we never discussed the quirk of fate that found the four of us sharing one disguised box lunch i brought to the football banquet each year we pretended not to notice that the other girls shared theirs with only one boy a different boy each time after all the boxes were disguised no one but the nun in charge knew who was going to draw which box educate to give knowledge or training instruct to form and develop ones taste etc senior year was spent in the public school there were many more negro young people here and we talked more freely to the faculty they were very kind and understanding their indulgence in explaining that we could not use the swimming pool because it was simply too expensive to drain it every other day was above reproach there was not even a problem in electing the king and queen for the promtwo sets one negro one caucasian the instruction was as excellent in the public school as it had been in the catholic school although in retrospect notable for what we did not learn rather than for what we did learn in studying african and negro history as an adult i reproached myself many times for not having paid attention in class thereby having to wait years before realizing the beauty and pride of the great americans of african heritage    until my own children were in school attention had nothing to do with it we lived several years in a white neighborhood where my children were never in a class larger than  i taught them the history of the american negro that they were not receiving in school as well as the history being made with sitins bus rides and the like they are now being educated in an allnegro school with from  to  to a class and i no longer have to worry about the lack of history last month they studied africa they learned that the people there get drunk all the time in discussing what they had learned they thought that perhaps the men who loaded the banana boats drank a barrel of wine each night because they were frightened of the tarantulas they were far more interested however in their new knowledge of the animals cannibals no one could have asked for a finer and more intricate description of how a person is cut open and his heart attached to a stick to be burned before he is eaten perhaps they were taught other things but they and some of the other children who  talked to me about this privileged course cant remember past the fascinating life of the cannibal perhaps the denver school administration will set up another council to study it llie school board is grand about setting up councils to study the problems of the negro community they dont seem to have a problem saying yes or no mostly yes to the white community    but with us they set up councils education is not much of a problem however we now have remedial training courses this enables a young person once he has gone through  years of overcrowded schools fantastically rapid teacher turnover antiquated books and such to go back and learn what he could have learned from the beginning given half a chance by the administration without the help of the councils committee a group of people chosen to consider some matter or function councils and committees    what would the man do if it werent for the committee he would have to do of course    therefore the committee several months ago members of civil_rights groups and social problem organizations went to the mayor to discuss the mounting complaint of police brutality but said the mayor we already have the internal affairs bureau investigation of police by police and the mayors committee on citycitizens relations nonpaid committee appointed by the mayor to investigate complaints after much discussion it was decided that perhaps a committee was the answer hence the community relations bureau three police officers spend a great deal of time going to school explaining what nice people policemen are and what overwhelming problems they face the iab continues to find accusations ridiculous the mcccr continues to ignore charges the crb continues their public relations drive    we still hear the complaints of police brutality but what the hell could we have another committee study about policemen employ to make use of use to provide work and pay for thats just about it they make use of use and sometimes provide work    but pay for thats not quite right my caustic tongue leaps ahead of real constructive thinking negroes and spanishsurnamed people gain fine jobs the federal center post office city and state commissions councils and committees each time the masses grumble some nice minority person is given another position lets hope that the government never executes a wholesale dismissal or the walls of this ghetto will swell back to bursting poverty the condition or quality of being poor indigence need there is a war on it boards are set up for it people are hired to fight it they are paid huge salaries to combat it the boards and staffs are so busy talking about what they are going to do about it that they cant find it boards must have one third of the membership comprised of the poor boards establishing poverty programs are composed of kind sensitive concerned people so they sometimes set up two boards one for the powerful and one for the indigent this saves the poor from having to worry about hiring staff business and all the appalling things the poor shouldnt have to worry about on top of being poor never mind that the war on poverty was designed to build leaders and selfdirection in the indigent communities    they are too busy being poor to have the time confusing well so is the war on poverty rehabilitation in sociology to restore a dependent defective or criminal to a state of physical mental and moral health through treatment and training years ago the united states had a system of revenge in the penitentiary penancepenitentiary modern day penology no longer believes in revenge we train men and women living in penal institutions we train them to load cans of beans on shelves pick beets maintain silence or we put them on the waiting list of the more enlightening programs perhaps this is just as well the frustration of the untrained man will be less than the trained individual when he discovers that society will not allow him to complete his sentence and obtain employment no matter how learned and skilled he might be young people are no problem at all the consensus seeming to be that the graduated steps from juvenile hall to buena vista to colorado state prison are better than what he would have at home anyway once he gets to csp he can then go through the abovementioned training routine and be saved or he can gain the status of a returnee which puts him into another category and i think theres a committee to study the returnee problem news recent happenings especially those broadcast over the radio printed in a newspaper etc reports of such events living in the north one hears a vast amount of criticism concerning the atrocities of the south newspapers print the findings of committees in washington that study the problems of minorities a lot is heard about the stability of integrated park hill they even have tours of the beautiful homes there inhabited by doctors lawyers judges teachers etc we hear about other minorities in denver in crime reports other cities should educate employ house and learn from the lessons taught in farreaching areas seemingly then we have no troubles in denver this entire paragraph was wasted time    excuse me    lead to show the way to or direct the course of by going before or along with  one would think from this definition that of necessity a leader would need something to lead our leaders dont seem to be bothered with this encumbrance the going before seems to please most of them its the along with that brings on the glassyeyed stare leaders have a conscience though surveys can do wonders for a conscience with leaders surveys take precedence over committees civil_rights in law relating to the private rights of individuals and to legal actions involving these in  mrse rosa parks gave us the courage to begin a new era of revolt at least one publicized as revolt rather than riot the backlash of boycotts and freedom rides in southern communities moved some to demonstrations in the north core naacp and sncc demonstrated in denver demanding a fair housing law equal employment and so on even the most biased looked upon the negro with new respect although they claimed that this riotous behavior was pushy perhaps it was necessary for separate but equal equality we made strides and then relaxed civil_rights organizations certainly dont form councils or committees they abhor them    they dont do anything about them but they abhor them oh yes they do do something they draw up philosophy and guidelines they worry a lot about riots and a great deal of time is spent talking about those people hours are spent talking about how to reach them it is amazing that they are so apathetic that they never show up at meetings set up for them in some isolated from them sterile section of the city devil

listen attentively to the platitudes of the white liberal who tells them they must go slow    that things are better    dont rock the boat the liberal who when not in the hearing of his negro friend is not quite so liberal the liberator who drags his feet as he reaches the gate the freedom lover who desires integration but not in his block the white man who is shocked as he hears discussions of violencevsnonviolence by the frustrated negro if our children are to be able to live with some semblance of harmony in the future we must face and fight these hypocrisies or we the masses will

there two categoj a jpa £ ries of individuals in  ii £ the united states who are upset enous h at the present progress of the civil_rights revolution to call their supporters to arms the first type is the frightened fringetype white conservatives who fear their american way of life is threatened these people are arming to protect what they call their constitutional rights the second group is civil_rights workers who are arming to protect themselves from physical attacks by people usually of the first group for the first group any gain in civil_rights is too much for the second group present gains are not enough the issues on both sides center around the progress of the civil_rights movement this article will deal with considerations posed by the arming of civil_rights workers the basic strategy of whose movement has been nonviolence any examination of its progress or problems has to deal first with the basic tactic of nonviolence as a vehicle for social political and cultural revolution there are certain basics which must be taken into consideration at the outset first negroes constitute approximately  per cent of the nations population second the rights that negroes seek were guaranteed them by the working of the democratic process further it was almost  years after the american constitution and declaration of independence before the words set down in those two documents were considered to apply to black men these facts indicate just one thing whether we like it or not negroes are existing in the united states with these guarantees such as they are at sufferance of the white majority negroes have been in america for more than  years we did the manual labor necessary for the economic growth of the country we provided the white world with the leisure time to educate itself and to progress along the paths of civilization we fought in the wars of defense of the country we gave this country its only indigenous culture and art form by any standard one would care to establish we belong here but belonging and getting what is rightfully ours are two different things to achieve the latter to fully possess our birthright we must of necessity adopt a minority underdog tactic there are just two proven tactics befitting our circumstances one is guerilla warfare the other is passive resistance nonviolence any other form of overt resistance in the face of superior numbers and resistance capacity is sheer folly ornonsense guerilla warfare is based upon several basic principles first the majority of the population must be in sympathy with the new cause because guerillas must live off the land and their hitandrun tactics  are dependent upon the support of others second the confrontation with the enemy must take place at sites where the insurgents have a superior knowledge of the terrain while the opposition is ignorant of or illsuited to the surroundings third terrorism becomes an essential element of the struggle both friend and enemy must be afraid of the consequences of being set upon by the insurgent group the fact that the civil_rights movement in the united states is fatally short of the elements of guerilla warfare is so apparent as to make further consideration of this form of resistance pointless nonviolence has a long and a successful history of overcoming formidable odds in the interests of progress in ancient times perhaps the most dramatic example was the christian struggle for tolerance acceptance and dominance the christian idea was an unpopular one going to the very roots of what the majority rigidly held as sacred here is a persuasive example of a hated and feared underdog who ultimately conquered the one single factor characterizing this development was the nonviolent nature of the christians purges sadistic indignities and horrifying deaths did not alter their selected course and their strategem of passive resistance as a result of this experience it became well documented that an idea cannot be suppressed or killed with violence conversely it demonstrates that an idea cannot be furthered by force either people supplant one idea only with one they believe to be better even more pertinent is the fact that an idea cannot be protected by violence if this were the case then the lynchings killings and other crimes of southern whites would have wiped out the idea of freedom for the black man in the south thus maintaining the notion of white supremacy forever we know that this is certainly not the case there are those who believe in the cylical theory of historyhistory repeats itself whether this is a valid historical hypothesis or not one has to be impressed with the parallels between ancient rome and the united states today rome had reached a very high degree of civilization when christianity became a serious issue first there were frantic efforts at suppression of the new ideology when the atrocities and fanaticism failed to change the dedication and faith of the christians the pagan romans became impressed with the dignity and inner superiority of these new turn the other cheek christians and many were convinced that any religion which provided its followers with this type of conviction and courage had to be superior they then made this better idea their own just as the pagans of rome bowed to the superiority of a new idea so the civil_rights leaders have the same challenge offered them to demonstrate the intrinsic and innate merit of their ideas this cannot be done by looking down the barrel of a gun whether it is in defense or not because the person at the other end is not going to be impressed with anything other than the fact that he wishes he were some place else those in the movement who are advocating arms to make the distinction between defensive violence and offensive violence are in for trouble this is about as easy as trying to separate an uncle tom from a good nigger it just depends on your point of view further as rev martin_luther_king jr points out perhaps offensive and defensive violence has meaning for intellectuals but for the rest of us the line of demarcation rapidly and easily disappears in any emotional hostile confrontation perhaps one of the most succinct statements on the whole issue of black_power andor violence by a civil rightist was made by dick gregory in jackson mississippi at the conclusion of the meredith march he said to the large audience there you know what remember those atomic bombs we dropped by mistake in spain well i wish they would drop one right down here in mississippi laughter no really right here pause anlet us find it then baby we would have black_power laughter its a funny thing but the way you say black_power down here sounds like black_power to me and that scares hell out of me laughter but anyway we find this here atomic bomb an you know what we do with it then we take it right over to governor johnsons mommas house gales of laughter she looks out of the window and starts to sing you have overcome then we takes it to the white house and say to lbj hey baby we got us some black_power now and well trade it for some civil_rights laughter what gregory was obviously and truthfully getting at was the fact that unless there is an overwhelming amount of potential violence we cannot expect to gain any lasting respect or change through the use of direct violence one of the very strange paradoxes of the civil_rights leaders wanting to arm and there are several is the fact that it flies in the face of everything progressive or forward looking violence on a world scale has been effectively eliminated as a method of settling disputes furthering ideals or protecting ideas certainly there are koreas cubas viet nams and there will be others but these are local and isolated and although the threat of involvement by two large nations  directly confronting each other is apparent it is highly unlikely that such an event will materialize the point is that war on a world scale has been informally diminished as a means of settling world crisis as this becomes more and more the case then the case for settlement by negotiation becomes stronger but settlement by negotiation presupposes some sort of forum debate such as the un this in turn means representative bodies at work because of the composition of the worlds peoples the majority of nations are nations of color this fact and the need of support from these countries at conferences and meetings has been one of the principal reasons for a more active role by the u s government in civil_rights our representatives were subjected to ridicule and scorn before these august bodies when they spoke of selfdetermination peoples independence democracy and other platitudes in the cold war as it is constituted now the u s simply could not afford to tolerate the senseless and undemocratic denial of negro rights this became our lever the pictures of defenseless innocent people simply petitioning for their rights and being set upon with dogs clubs and water hose were the fulcrum of the lifting up of negro rights before the world make no mistakethe essential element was the fact that these people were without question free of evil or sinister motives it was without doubt the fact that they were acting in good faith and good will introduce the element of arms be they for defense or offense and a diminution and dilution of the image takes place to advocate arming is to preach directly against the dictates of the lessons of history and contemporary common sense in a word it is nonsense we cannot however depend upon the governments concern for world opinion to continue to carry the bulk of civil_rights progress we have had government charity before it was just a  years ago when negroes were feeling the first flush of freedom as the result of the norths suppression of the souths campaign to secede just as northern punishment of the south then was based more on vindictiveness than on moral commitment so when the time was expedient for the government to forget its charity it did so and the negro was suppressed more fiercely than before history has demonstrated that we cannot expect any sustained windfalls we must press on and convince the white united states that complete civil_rights is the only acceptable posture for the negro further we must illustrate to the power structure black and white that the alternative to progressive civil_rights is something totally unacceptable to them in other words it must be positively manifested to the respective power structures that it is in their best interest to continue to press for complete and full civil_rights if we are going to depend principally upon indigenous domestic pressures to maintain the civil_rights momentum then it becomes imperative that we have certain negroes who are capable and dedicated by circumstance of maintaining the pressure in a very real sense we have a need for neonecessary negroes the traditional necessary negro was the one who sat by the door as you came into an otherwisewhite office he was the especially invited black at select social gatherings just as the white power structure needs necessary negroes so does the black_power structure need neonecessary negroes to explain further let us repeat the well established point that power has the tendency to do two things first it corrupts second it makes its possessor conservative the neonecessary negro keeps pressure on the black_power structure to keep pressure on the white power structure an example of this in operation is the fact that the one black man most responsible for the successes of rev martin_luther_king jr was malcolm_x malcolm_x did two things to and for dr_king he kept king honest in a word he kept him on his toes second malcolm_x astonished frightened and coerced a number of powerful white and black people into supporting king as the lesser of two evils these people saw in king an acceptable alternative to the kind of philosophy malcolm_x was advocating the result was that kings position and prestige were enhanced immeasurably no amount of black money could have bought this kind of support it was only through the fear generated by malcolm_x the original neonecessary negro that dr_king was able to insure for himself acceptance by the national and international power structures as leader of the civil_rights movement with malcolm_x gone and the civil_rights movement even more in need of neonecessary negroes than before we have a new breed of militant negroes coming forth with frightening way out ideas the rallying cry for this new breed is black_power like most new slogans and oversimplifications black_power has almost as many different meanings ? as there are people who care to define it there are certain notions common to most responsible definitions though usually there is an emphasis on the negros effective utilization of his political potential in addition there is usually a call for negroes to support black business and in general to think in terms of separation to the emerging militant leaders who depend on militancy as their sustaining virtue and who must come up with more sensational radical doctrines the term black_power very literally means black fire power its a common occurrence that neophytes must be more  of whats popular in order to get their foot in the door and compete with the incumbents the civil_rights movement is no different the new breed must come up with more excitingsounding slogans in order to gain a following and push the older mellowing leaders aside that the neonecessary negroes play an important function in the long range success of civil_rights is not disputed here what is at issue is the fact that the more militant violenceoriented leaders are advocating policies which are historically strategically and logistically unfeasible and absolute nonsense that these men as long as they are a definite minority are essential to the progress of the nonviolent tactic for civil_rights is readily admitted the civil_rights movement is going toward the gray areas the fact that the federal government is nominally supporting civil_rights the fact that the president actively calls for an end to discrimination and the fact that each new legislative session brings new and better laws on the subject all point to one thing the opposition to civil_rights posing the most formidable challenge is the subtle elusive form which lies ahead no longer will there be an exact and well defined delineation but vivid lines of demarcation will give way to amorphous boundaries of gray a little more than  years ago the united states undertook to defeat the gray of america and was successful if the nonviolent and the neonecessary negroes continue to unwillingly supplement and complement each other we can do it again perhaps there is something to the cyclical theory of history after all
his name was colored boyr and he lived in the slums in the very heart of a huge black ghetto his wife was the negro cook and his children were simply known as those people and like his father before  him and his father before that and n indeed as all of his forefathers who had ever walked in this hostile land h had no rights he was reminded of this fact daily as he watched his wife wearily making her way to the affluent suburbs where she toiled for coolie wages and he was vividly aware of this fact as he himself made his way to yet another suburb where he slaved for wages similar to those paid his wife and he knew this beyond a shadow of a doubt when he saw his children returning home day after day year after year from their ancient dilapidated school with no books no homework and no hope he was the handyman in a huge gleaming ultramodern supermarket which never ceased to amaze him everything worked there the food carts moved with only the slightest touch there were none of those rusty threewheeled numbers which abounded in his neighborhood and there were always plenty of cashiers who smiled and who indeed acted as if they truly believed the customer was always right but the most incredible phenomena of all were the products which were not only of the finest quality but were so beautiful to look at until he often felt it was almost a sin to take money for working in such a showplace of beauty the meats were a succulent vibrant red and the fruits and vegetables were so fresh looking until he was certain they grew right there in their bins and there were never any bent cans on the shelves or busted packages which seemed to form the very foundation of the markets in his forlorn neighborhood of course hed worked on the job several years now and he knew what happened when the meats grew tired and the vegetables drooped and the fruits turned brown from overripeness some of it was given to him here boy you take this home if you want and he wanted taking it home in two used slightly soiled shopping bags which he kept handy for such occasions but most of the used and abused goods were loaded onto a huge truck in the hush of night and shipped out to other neighborhoods where the stores did not gleam and the cashiers snarled and worked terribly slow and acted as if they believed the motley illclad customers were intruders and the most amazing part of all however was what happened to the prices apparently as meats grew older their value increased for those tired steaks in his district were always at least ten cents higher than they were when they sparkled in that gleaming store in that golden suburb he had not been born here in this city of concrete and noise dirt and heat toil and loneliness he had come from down yonder seeking a better different life than that of his father who had only endured with the aid of the pint bottle for ever lodged in the hip pocket of his worn overalls he had come here a young man filled with hope and great expectations thinking he had at last found a new land that wanted him as much as he wanted to belong but somehow that very same day of his arrival those men in blue had spied his jaunty step had sensed his hopeful spirit and had backed him up against a wall searching his pockets poking his ribs and reminding him once and for all that he had not gone anywhere at all down yonder was all over wherever he went and he must learn to live with that fact if he wanted to live at all and so quietly inch by inch day by day he finally died before his marriage he had not minded too much the haunting image of death that followed him night and day he had learned to live with it as man has always learned to live with whatever hells he finds surrounding him but when he met another as vulnerable as once he had been he yearned to warn and protect her from the inevitable tortures that lay ahead and his situation became intolerable and he began wearing the pint bottle in his hip pocket in the manner of his father and his fathers father then they were married and the children came and he became the handyman and his wife became the cook and they watched their two children destined for nowhere as such children are always fated to end and once again the process of dying became his daily bread his wife had hope still and a sense of humor at times and always she tried to stand her ground against adversity which came in many ways in many shapes and in many colors whenever they happened to trade at their dingy overcrowded market for staples which were often misshappen or otherwise flawed and were always at least five cents higher than those in his golden supermarket his wife never let anyone slip ahead of them no matter how small the number of packages they held she merely shook her head and winked slightly line baby she would then add nodding toward the rear their children when very small had been his one remaining source of joy and his little girl now only nine still adored him but his son had just turned  and had learned the score and now no longer met his fathers eyes you have this camera and this here transitor he would accuse feeling the quality of the items as only a man who owns cheap goods can feel the fineness in that which is not cheap you got em from th boy down th street where did he get em and the silence and then the shrug but never the meeting of the eye as the eyes of father and son should meet take them back the mother would command and then she would proceed to stare her son down while his father walked away to his room to squint nervously at the remains of his pint bottle and  an ineffable sadness would settle over him for he knew that one day his daughter too would learn the score and would no longer rush to greet him in the evening when he came through the door and it became a nightmare that followed him to work now and made him want to do strange things as he did the day he saw the blonde woman with her two blonde children rosy wellfed and welldressed and running their cart over him as they always did but this day he grabbed the cart and was about to ram it into those three sparkling people when someone called to him and brought him back to earth he turned in time to see one of the boys he worked with only they were really boys eighteen or nineteen but nobody called them boys they had names and white faces come on the boy urged we need th mop somebody spilled something and he took his mop and went to clean up the mess as he was told to do then there came the time just before he was about to leave early on his halfday off with his two soiled shopping bags laden with flawed goods when he saw the lady in line her soft white hand clutching a wad of green bills not fives or tens but twenties and fifties and even a couple of hundreds and he stood mesmerized his eyes glued to the bills then suddenly he felt himself reaching out to clutch the hand when the floor manager bumped into him and snapped sharply take your broom and git the hell out the way boy and he took his mop and bucket and got the hell out the way as he was told to do and soon he made his weary way back to his prison where the gray invisible walls rose up to meet him as he came out of the subway his two shopping bags weighing him down like the eternal burden that he carried on his back his black skin and his haunted heritage in a land which banished him to an everlasting terror which people often called the ghetto    but today a different feeling seemed to pervade the place true the air as usual hung hot and humid laced with the odors of worn out men and women and their innumerable discards which no longer were even capable of delighting the rats then he was made aware of an unnatural silence which banged against his head like an overthrown baseball and he came to a dead standstill wondering for a moment if he had somehow wandered into a strange part of town but then as he stood there peering about in that uncertain fashion which had long been his habit now the silence was shattered as a group of children saw his burdened figure and started running toward him shouting his name which almost no one bothered to use any more then they were upon him all talking at once each eager to be the one who got his story across first it was a total jumble for a moment but then two words leaped out and grabbed him his son was shot why why he clutched a squirming child who    who    the men in blue    he was running running running but children were always running yes but not his children they should walk crawl and be searched standing against the brick wall their ribs poked by a sinister stick their laughter stilled upon their youthful lips where where is he    the hospital hours ago with a man in blue standing at the door turning everyone away even the local minister and a white priest were not allowed to enter the hospital is blocks away and his shoes are worn and his feet are ruined but he rushes there neither his feet nor his shopping bags burdening him down any longer down the long silent corridor so like the somber areas in all his nightmares past all the battered doors hiding their suffering inhabitants enfolding them in their halfworld of pain and sorrow he made his way numb with four centuries of agony waiting to overwhelm him the door is open the man in blue is gone and so is his songone where and silence greets him but does not touch him for his numbness is total there is nothing left now he turns and leaves by a side door still carrying his soiled shopping bags which have now become a part of his body flawed and irrelevant he moves on down the street but the children finally see him and rush to surround him with endless questions however he does not hear them nor does he see them he merely walks down the street in his shabby shoes and limp gray shirt and tattered blue trousers and he walks and walks and the children following him increase in number and grow larger in size and finally men and women are following him also and it becomes a parade as still more people join from block to block and someone starts singing and soon they are all singing all except him who leads the way and no longer sees or hears and on and on they move until hes finally confronted with the men in blue who call to him in their usual way hey boy what you got in them bags come here let us see and once again he does as he was told to do he lets them see but suddenly his mauled fist streaks through the air meeting the big red chin of the man in blue then all at once the air is filled with mauled fists as the men women and children who now surround him follow his action and the singing grows louder and the mauled fists fill the air and bedlam is everywhere now he begins to sing as feeling comes back to him again and he strikes and strikes and strikes   he regains consciousness several days later wrapped like a mummy in a hospital room his body filled with pain

johnny mathis fans are usually unduly intolerant of those who dont dig mr mathis well were more consideratewe only quarrel with those who deny that his is one of the more beautiful voices of our time what has come to be called the mathis magic is once again available on the mercury release the shadow of your smile excepting the title song with its nauseating arrangement the album is filled with the immaculate phrasing marvelous breath control and the fantastic rangefrom near falsetto to deep baritoneof the man george avakian once described as having four voices some of the tunes such as michelle im in love for the very first time and i left my heart in san francisco are handled really well but others are absolutely fabulous his rendition of the haunting yesterday leaves one involved in the songs drama and his craftsmanship is remarkable on the exciting somethings coming from west side story on a clear day you can see forever is tailormade for the romantic style of mathis and one shares with him a certain joy on a fun song called come back to me which finds mathis unusually ethnic and inspires the listener to rise and do what the spirits says do as usual there is a number included which affords mathis the chance to journey beyond the beyond he comments that in a song he looks for that intangible value that distinguishes something as being out of the ordinary a taste of honey remember morgana is such a song and mathis is such a singerdlin a very real sense the new wave in jazz impulse is a microcosm of jazz history simultaneously recalling the idioms turbulent past and opening doors to what may be the dominant theme in jazzs future for the next several decades many followers will easily recall the transition period of the forties when a group of young experimenters named john birks dizzy gillespie theolonius monk charles yardbird parker max roach and charles mingus and maybe a few others were toying with a brand new kind of jazz improvisation they called bop after a period of heated controversy about the merits of the new music bop and the other forms it influenced became a respectable and accepted school of learning for jazzmen now comes a set of latterday experimenterstenor men john coltrane archie shepp albert ayler altoists marion brown james spaulding trumpeters ashley fennell donald ayler and charles tolliver drummers billy higgins bill harris and roger blank and otherswho are introducing another radical step in jazz improvisation the album contains five numbers recorded at the village in new york city for the benefit of the black arts repertory theatre in harlem at that time headed by leroi jones this thrill and mystify new black music as jones calls it is completely free of any distinguishable at least to the layman listener melody and almost totally departs from all previous musical forms it combines a strange maybe exotic many times exasperating set of whaling squeaky droning and pounding sounds which leave most of us confused groping for something identifiable according to what we have been taught as western music therein lies our error this is not western music this is black music all of these musicians would probably welcome the label black nationalist not because each of them is ready to take to the streets and put the torch to all of western civilization but because they are swept up in the current racial upheaval that finds the black man searching for an identity that is not western but african jones explains you hear on this record poets of the black nation albert ayler in his liner notes tells us the creators of the new music have reached deep into their psyches deep into their cultural origins to find a language of sound that conveys this sense of the world as feeling as knowledge found through the logic of the emotions and truly its the emotions and not the logic of sound that is at work here coltrane together with drummer elvin jones bassist jimmy garrison and pianist mccoy tyner will you on nature mathis boy the ayler brothers on holy ghost trombonist grachan moncur on blue free shepp  co on hambone and tolliver and spaulding on brilliant corners will leave you with either a sense of bewilderment as to what they are trying to say or with an esthetic attachment that has deep roots in the black mans determined drive to shed every vestige of the white mans cultural influencefrancis ward
naomi long madgetts third book of poems star by star harlo press  shows a progression in technique and a widening in themes reviewing her previous book one and the many saunders redding called her a natural poet she has a remarkably keen ear and not only uses the traditional forms with grace but invents new forms and uses the difficult though apparently easy free verse with skill redding was probably referring to her metrical ease as shown in quest which reprinted with a number of other poems from her previous volume has the haunting melodic quality of verlaineanother outstanding reprint is midway which has been widely quoted and misquoted the long lines have the swinging rhythm of a march with its concrete images and biblical vocabulary familiar to everyone who has heard an oldtime preacher it may one day be set to music and used as a secular hymn ive come this far to freedom hese words crescendo to a climax of sound and not by the forced devices of italics or of all capital letters but by the syntax the rhythm the meaning and the gradual shift of vowels across the gamut from the short i of whispered to the broad a of walk the longest and most complex section of the book is trinity a dream sequence a love poem in nineteen sections although uneven it is rewarding in its allusiveness there are echoes not unpleasant of emily dickinson in destiny and star journey and of frost in woman with flower but for all her metrical skill her phrasing is weak the book has shopworn images and vague poetic terms like dreams one reflects on how emily dickinson would write twelve or fifteen synonyms on her manuscript in a search for the precise nuance and how dylan mrs culver explains in her preface that poems about black heroes are needed to give black children a favorable selfimage and to acquaint white children with the accomplishments of black people the range of heroes in this book extends from crispus attucks the revolutionary war martyr to the freedom riders and james meredith the book closes with a poem called my brotherion coupled with the forced interest that the civil_rights movement carries have turned out literal mountains of materials about the race question in this constant parade of material one can find all types and tones but one of the most gratifying kinds of works is that by legitimate scholars often these books are dry with facts almost always they are the products of reasoned thinking based upon extensive research the very good ones are the result of excellent minds skilled in research techniques that can set the findings down in interesting and readable style arthur waskows from race riot to sitindoubleday  co  is an excellent example of this last category arthur waskow in addition to bringing skills intelligence and interest to the subject matter carries with him something of an overview he is a man of broad interests and his previous books carried the titles the limits of defense and the worried mans guide to world peace waskow could be called an internationalist if we were looking for easy titles but more accurately he is a very bright man who is concerned with the problems that confront us race is one of those problems and one of the phenomena of race in america is the evolution of tactics and manifestations of unrest mr waskow has done a professional and thorough job of tracing this development from  to the s
with all the fuss going on these days about whether things negroid should be so labeled one would think langston hughes is in danger of being called a racial separatist for editing the book of negro humor dodd mead  co  thats what it isnegro humor not a foolish mixture of chinese jokes or irish ditties or eskimo party breakers to vindicate the sanctity of the american melting pot this page collection of jokes funny poems and stories downhome tales humorous remembrances and pure sidesplitting comedy come from every segment of negro life it is us baby from the black preacher on sunday in the pulpit to the harlem card shyster from unheralded unknowns like effie lee newsome and robert a johnson to renowned spokesmen for the brother  like hughes himself james weldon johnson and martin_luther_king jr come many precious and memorable morsels of good humor and fun thats one of the good things about this book hughes sort of a selftaught specialist on the life and times of black men from his native missouri to harlem realizes that to capture the gaiety and wholesome spontaneity of negro humor he had to go to the sourceto dozens of black men and women themselves plain people who at some juncture in their  ives had something funny to say not that hughes does not draw freely from the masters paul laurence dunbar johnson zora neal hurston godfrey cambridge arna bontemps as well as his own writings a witty line thorny subtlety or tickling poem or tale from one or all of them crops up constantly through out the book however its great strength lies in hughes ability to comprehensively reflect the everyday happenings of black existence in the melting pot by drawing on the recollections of so many people from so many walks of life also of worth is the editors ability to draw togetherunder general headings like cool comics or jokes and jivesome of the best from oldtimers like jazzmen w c handy jelly roll morton comedians pigmeat markham and mantan moreland and to fuse them with clarity and consistency with the offerings of more recent writers or folklorists such as leroi jones james baldwin roi ottley john o killens and dan burley as one would naturally expect since it has been the central fact of the black mans life for nearly  years in america the race issue is treated by numerous contributors with different messages and varying degrees of wit bitterness and folksiness seldom if ever does anybody wear off into the wilds of unrestrained racialism on the other hand whitey doesnt get off without being reminded of his injustices hughes cambridge dick gregory ottley and other lesser names make sure of that besides having the supremely beneficial effect of entertaining readers by making them laughat themselves and the world outsidethis fine collection of writings has one other salutary plus to its credit it allows negroes to laugh at their frailties and foibles without the spectre of thinking they are supporting societys stereotype of the nonthinking grinning headscratcher some of the stereotypes are taken out of character laughed at then forgotten about without any notice of a supposed larger meaning even ancient movie performer it would be misleading to say actor mantan moreland is allowed a brief space in hughes democracy of comedy and witticisms without the slightest hint of morelands white teeth big eyes and round sweaty black face attributes which did more than a lions share in the s and s to perpetuate the white mans myth about the small size of the negros brain francis ward
southerner lippincott  by congressman charles longstreet weltner is the honest revelation of a southerner by birth northern in education and right on the masondixon line as far as civil_rights and social relationships are concerned it could just as aptly have been entitled anatomy of advance because congressman weltner does represent an advance over his congressional predecessors from atlanta georgia it perhaps would have been a more apt title because his views are certainly not those of the general white south and anything in the present title to suggest that the contents do reflect the general opinions of the white southerner is misleading congressman weltner manifests many of the traits possessed by a few intelligent and ambitious men of the new south these men are able to see the turn of the tide of social and political forces they can count they can add and they can analyze these are realists pragmatists and moderates these capacities all tend to demonstrate to them that the south will no longer be able to function politically unless the negro is considered as a factor of vital and integral importance this is not to suggest that men like congressman weltner are becoming liberal it is not to infer that they are irrevocably dedicated to openmindedness on the race issue it is only to state that they are willing to do the right thing so long as it is practical feasible and fairly safe congressman weltner makes a fair statement of the doctrine of the southern moderate as a southerner it was hard for me to contemplate the changes that were being sought but as an american i knew that manifest wrongs to a substantial number of the nations people required a remedy the remedy for congressman weltner was the law his feelings about race and the solution to the manifest wrongs to a substantial number of the nations people    is to fall in line with the law this makes no demand on his sense of morality or ethics on the race question however obeying the law is really just the beginning of the solution but it is a start and men like weltner are appearing with some regularity in the south they are an interesting breed and one of them writing about himself with honesty makes interesting readingbrooks johnsonyou have heard it from other sources white people have heard it too when martin_luther_king jr says oppression is just as damaging to the oppressor as to the oppressed many people shrug and think he is attempting to win greater support for his cause the bare truth is that those who stand by mute and allow the rights of others to be destroyed are paving the way for the capricious denial of their own rights hodding carters so the heffners left mccomb doubleday  is another of a series of books illustrating this truth there are a number of books from the south written by those of the white race who have had their own damaging personal brush with the race issue most of these people were not liberals or radicals they were guilty only of sympathy tolerance and quasichristianity to the rest of the south this deviation from the cracker line is heresy and retribution is swift crude and effective the heffners are what we have come to think of as being in the mississippi  tradition she physically attractive as the mississippi beauty queens have been he the white delta look of many of the middle class ambitious men of the south in most ways they were like their neighbors active in segregated community affairs but somewhere along the line they had the decency to talk in their home with some white civil_rights workers one a minister for this they were literally forced out of their state ostracized and forced to sell their home they were denied their rights just as effectively as many negroes have been denied their birthright the story of how this was accomplished is interesting and well told but the real value lies in the fact that perhaps as a result more people will better understand martin_luther_king jr when he says oppression knows no color oppression and oppressor alike are stripped of their dignity and rights or as john donne said long ago no man is an island we are all involved in all of what happens to all of mankindbrooks johnson
the value of an anthology is that it brings together the best poems or a group of poems on a certain subject or introduces new poems or new poets ordinarily such a book as langston hughess bilingual la poesie negro americaine editions seghers n p would not be of interest to american readers for since it is the first fullscale anthology of black american poets in french the compiler need only have repeated the selections of previous american anthologies however mr hughes has made enough fresh additions to make this book of value to american readers the selection from m b tolson is an example in three previous anthologies the editors used only his dark symphony a choice which helped to prevent this excellent poet from being more widely known as there were other more recent and better poems of his available but in this book mr hughes has included a section from tolsons libretto for the republic of liberia in an amusing footnote the editor states that tolsons language was impossible to translate and the english alone is given a large part of the book which ranges from phillis wheatley to david henderson is given to newer poets those who have one or more poems which cling to the memory are julia fields bob kaufman ray durem leroi jones conrad kent rivers raymond patterson g c oden oliver lagrone mari evans james a emanuel lucy smith and worth long the harlem renaissance poets are generously represented with both standard anthology pieces and lesser known work the poems from poets who emerged in the forties are repeats from earlier anthologies but the selections from robert hayden gwendolyn brooks and margaret walker can bear repeating margaret danner has the short piece best loved of africa it is interesting to see what the translators alain bosquet sim copans jean copans francois dodat and jean wagner did with american slang and negro dialect they made no effort to duplicate the meters or to transform them into a french equivalent their translations are literal word for word line for line erwin a salks a laymans guide to negro history quadrangle  paperback is a reasonably comprehensive guidebook to information on negro history including phonograph records film strips and reference sources as well as books and magazines as an illustration of the books range there are  pages devoted to negro inventors the book deserves a place on all collectors lists jerry cohen and william s murphy have writen a book entitled burn baby burn dutton and co  no one who followed the los angeles riots of last year will need to be told the significance of those three words they were the rallying cry and the slogan for the black people in the watts area of la who discovered black_power and were determined to use it to eradicate the presence of everything white in their area the aftermath of black_power on the rampage was  people killed  injured  buildings damaged  buildings completely destroyed and material lost in the amount of  million dollars the real loss is yet to come the watts riot proved something to the black people of watts and everywhere else under certain circumstances they can literally take over unfortunately watts has not proven very much to the white power structure in the big cities they still deal and perhaps even believe in the old platitudes and archaic theories about race the real repercussions will be felt when the cold reality of black_power interacts negatively against white naivete racial ignorance and neglect and prejudice then will come a fuller more horrible realization of the meaning and the significance of watts burn baby burn is an interesting book because the authors have been painstaking researchers concerning the causes and the consequences of the riots no one person at the scene is likely to have been aware of everything that was going on in that unlikely looking ghetto nevertheless i think the authors understand the basic elements which went into the making of the riot which so upset los angeles smug narcissuslike attitude about race however they also demonstrate some of the symptoms of the ills of the white com munity as a whole which is fine let me elaborate and say that i was there at the time of the riots and visited the watts area during the days of uneasy peace and the nights when the only security clearance was a black skin there was something strangely exhilarating about being black and the fact that being black was the preferential way to be a symbol of securityliterally my salvation the feeling of pride was present even though i was sickened by some of the things i saw taking place the absolute wanton destruction the impulsive violence the irrationality of much that was happening all astonished me but that feeling of unity based upon something that had never before had such a valuea black skinwas also an astonishing experience the authors have captured some of this feeling and i believe it frightened them as it did other whites in the area who understood what was happening for a short time in those few blocks the world as they knew it turned upside down their skins were no longer taken for granted it was no longer a badge of superiority respect and preference to paraphrase the psalm we were black and beautiful oh ye daughters of los angeles the white world was isolated in a furious black world trying to extract its pound of flesh from whitey perhaps it is this fear which obstructs the objectivity of messrs cohen and murphy or perhaps it is the remnant of an atavistic prejudice but in their honest attempt to be impartial factual and dispassionate there are several slips the authors make a point of the hate literature which cropped up at the time of the riot one piece in particular concerns police chief parker in their emphasis on the fact that these leaflets stirred up trouble the authors neglect to give any consideraion to the possible veracity of the material a statement attributed to parker in the leaflets and reproduced over his photograph this man says you commit more crime and violence than anyone else was made by parker the leaflet further reads  per cent of those arrested by parkers cops are released without trial but still have arrest records result job discrimination the truth of this and it is true is not discussed by cohen and murphy but the inflammatory nature of the remarks themselves is this demonstrates the principal failing of the white man in his attempt to work out the race problem despite his good intentions and his desire to be fair he still sees the negative aspects of the negroes action before he begins to deal with or even recognize the shortcomings and mistakes of his own world read burn baby burn and discover watts again 
shakespeare said all the worlds a stage for the late dr melville j herskovits all the world was a laboratory this no doubt sounds like a remarkable statement fine dr herskovits was truly a remarkable man he was perhaps americas premier africanist more than that he was a scholar of immense proportions he was a man who had little tolerance for lethargy be it individual or national he was a democrat in the very finest sense of the word his friends included the president of the united states and numerous heads of state some of whom were former pupils of his as a result he was not impressed with titles but with worth and everyone who came in contact with him was judged on that basis with his death in  a dimness came over the area of african studies because he took with him his invaluable ideas notions theories and facts which he had accumulated over more than  years of observing in his world laboratory as his constant companion associate and a scholar in her own right no one is better equipped to edit and anthologize selected works of dr herskovits than frances s herskovits his wife editor of the new world negro indiana press  the new world negro focuses on the idea that a great deal of understanding of one culture african could be garnered by studying another culture afroamerican sounds rather strange that one can be some thousands of miles and years removed from the original culture and by observing and evaluating the activities mores and customs of descendants of that culture discover substantive truths about another all of this while the descendants are intricately interwoven in a new culture if the hypothesis is startling then the proof offered by dr herskovits is astounding the new world negro is an absolute must to anyone who expects to have a basic understanding of the relationship between the old world culture of africa and the afroamerican culture of today further it is an excellent example of what a fertile imaginative mind coupled with singular scholarship can produce at twice the price the book is still one of the best book buys available

it was hot that sum t mer mostly muggy  jl  with w n rom the lake but it had  cooled qff the day be fore the sun was shining few clouds in the sky the birds were singing a perfect sunday for a wedding i woke up early cooked breakfast washed the dishes and read the sunday papers and told myself that i wasnt nervous and not counting the hours until the ceremony i busied myself with things id been putting off and after awhile it was time to get dressed i laid everything out shined my shoes and showered and shaved i started to get a drink before i left thought better of it went outside got into the car turned on the radio and drove out into the sunshine and clouds and the birds singing most of the things even now are very clear but i cant remember a thing that was playing on the radio i parked the car and went into the lobby and down the stairs the reception was in the basement of a neighborhood hotel in a room they rented for small parties and banquets and receptions they had hired a combo three pieces piano bass and guitar and i could hear the music soft and very pretty as i went down the stairs her father was standing by the door and i spoke and we shook hands and chatted and i turned while we spoke of the pennant race and watched her passing out wedding cake she had very dark hair and her skin was rather tawny and she had a tan and her skin made a very nice contrast with the white lace her teeth were very white in her face as she smiled at people and every now and then she would bite the corner of her lip which means shes listening very closely to what you were saying and she would nod her head and the teeth would release her lip and then the smile i walked over and stood in line and she saw me then and smiled and when i got to the head of the line i shook bobs hand and congratulated him and wished them luck and it was only later when i was talking to her sister and wondering where to put the cake that i remembered that id forgotten to kiss the bride the combo started a number she used to like and i walked over and spoke to her mother and then walked back and said goodbye to her and went outside and drove home i took off my suit and hung it up and put on some shorts and went outside and began washing the car and i didnt get drunk i had done that the night she told me she was going to get married and i figured once was enough 
the student nonviolent coordinating committees unbudging determination to work out the black mans problem in the black mans way has provoked a strange response from the white side of the tracks suddenly there are uneasy stories about an ominous black nationalism in the south and when stokely carmichael snccs new chairman turned down an invitation to the white house conference on civil_rights this action is suddenly judged to be a new hard line just what does the white man want for a century he urged the negro to stay in his place but now when the negro says all right thats just what ill do and ill make it a better place to behe is called a black nationalist the difference between a negros staying in his place and black nationalism is only a degree of temper the former is servile the latter is angry thats the only difference and the whites might as well admit it when they complain about black nationalism theyre not complaining about anything new but now they are tacitly admitting fear of it and that is new as for snccs refusal to suffer more talk about civil_rights action it does not really seem so radical the school integration decision has been the law of the land for  years and less than five per cent of the negroes of the south are attending integrated schools the civil_rights act has been on the books for two years and negroes are still beaten when they try to buy food in public restaurants the voting rights act has been on the books for a year and federal registrars still have not been sent for example to sen james eastlands home county despite frequent pleas for their assistance totting up the need for action snccs impatience with more talk may be tactically unwise but it is surely understandable
