problems and prospects by frederick oneal or a number of years negroes were not allowed to perform on the legitimate stage in america negro characters were played by white actors in blackface down through the years casting patterns in the various entertainment media have changed to some extent but not very much during the period roughly between and negro stars such as bert williams and others were spotted in white shows as if they were so super special that they had to be shown in almost wholly unrelated roles and mostly alone they were just the darlingest quaintest oddest most interesting sexiest most exotic or in other words just about the best thing in the show but not really a part of it the most common method of handling the negro actor in the straight play was to cast him exclusively in socalled negro roles which inevitably meant in some servile capacity such as the maid butler cook etc let it be clearly understood here that there is nothing wrong with servant and comedy roles per se the criticism stems from the characterization presentation and interpretation of these parts which until recently took the form of lazy shuffling characters speaking a dialect that even negroes had never heard the types of roles played by negroes are more of a barometer than the number of these roles the negro actor feels that he is grossly discriminated against in the casting of shows in all of the entertainment media surely his talents could have been used in many parts in a manner that would not have distorted the artistic concept of the production indeed in many instances it would have enhanced such values it would seem that negroes and orientals are the only groups whose roles are circumscribed by race the irish actor can play a japanese character the jewish actor can play the indian german actors play italian characters and vice versa but the negro actor only has a chance of being cast if the part specifically indicates negro the imagination of the agent casting director play director playwright or manager preoccupied with timeworn casting patterns does not extend beyond the racially designated description in the manuscript but these same individuals have no difficulty whatsoever with their imaginations when it comes to the selection of perhaps a david wayne for the part of the japanese character sakini in teahouse of the august moon or of jeff chandler as an american indian now all of this may sound strange and contradictory when we realize that by and large people of the theater have been opposed to discrimination segregation and other forms of bigotry and hypocrisy actors equity association is the union which has jurisdiction over those actors dancers and singers who work in the legitimate theatre the council its governing body includes seven negro members and one officer among the seventytwo members for almost twenty years equity and the league of new york theatres the organization of theatrical producers have worked in cooperation with other elements inside as well as outside the theatre community to make this area of entertainment free and healthy the league equity the dramatists guild and other organizations and individuals have on more than one occasion joined together to defeat the threat of official censorship during the dark days of mccarthyism the antiblacklist committee in actors equity working with the league managed to keep the theatre relatively free from political persecution and the principle of guilt by association as a result of this kind of cooperative effort the theatre has remained the most free of all entertainment media while being ever mindful of its collective and individual responsibility and obligation to the public served in the mid s washington d c was one of the most lucrative stops on the touring theatre circuit but the management of the national theatre in that city maintained a policy of racial discrimination the league and equity pleaded with the management to drop this vicious and immoral policy and when this request was refused these two organizations together with members of the dramatists guild decided to refuse bookings in this or any other theatre in washington until such time as the management could see fit to change this policy this was in the national theatre remained closed for the next five years while touring shows played the gayety theatre a former vaudeville house that had dropped this discriminatory policy the national was finally remodeled and redecorated under a new management and reopened in with a welcome to all races and nationalities on a completely nondiscriminatory basis inasmuch as washington was just about the most segregated city in the united states at that time perhaps it was this collective action that broke the dam of prejudice and bigotry releasing the first wave of such changes that have taken place in that city since it was a healthy action that could only terminate in a wholesome result since by contractual agreement equity does not permit its members to work in any theatre where segregation and discrimination are practiced inquiries are often made of the union as to the number of negroes there are among its members due to the fact that the racial background of members is not indicated in the unions records no one actually knows some say a thousand or more others maintain that the figure is much lower equitys ethnic minorities committee has made an unofficial effort to determine the number of negro members of the union by inquiry among members both negro and white as to their knowledge of all negro actors known to them as members of equity after examining a number of lists submitted we found a great deal of duplication but from this somewhat unorthodox method we learned that the figure is around there may be negro artists who are members of other performing unions such as american guild of musical artists american federation of television and radio artists american guild of variety artists and screen actors guild actors equitys jurisdiction is only over those actors singers and dancers who perform on the legitimate stage in the united states and canada such jurisdiction also includes some industrial shows a few night club shows musical theatres summer stock etc each year many young negro and white actor hopefuls knock on the doors of producers they all look forward to a successful career in the theatre many inquire as to the chances for such success such chances vary somewhat according to the individual but on the whole they are pretty much the same for whites as for negroes except that the chances of those of high visibility are diminished or complicated by the existence of color a great deal of the imagined interest in and fitness for a career in the theatre is occasioned by the very rare freak success of a newcomer to the profession such a case is usually accompanied by reams of news stories and in some instances they are stories not really about a newcomer but about a well trained and experienced actor or actress being given a publicity buildup and the newcomer tag is but a useful gimmick unlike many other professions it is very difficult to establish oneself in the theatre there are many heartaches disappointments and frustrations in some cases this has led to mental instability the american negro as a whole has plumbed more levels of society economic religious political etcthan any other comparable group such experiences are of particular value to the negro actor especially in contemporary drama where more restrained portrayals are demanded however as in the classics we have not fared too well such style demands dedicated study and effort far too many members of the profession black and white have aligned themselves with the generally accepted lay opinion that one does not have to study in order to become an actor or actress within the last few years that segment of the profession has dwindled considerably and to the point where we now have a fairly large group of competent young actors and actresses who are ready for almost any assignment if the negro actor aspirant will remember all this and also that his chances of success are further complicated by the fact that he is a negro then i would suggest he secure a copy of the book opportunities in acting by dick moore published by universal publishing and distributing corporation in the vocational guidance manuals series it was written in answer to the many questions asked by those who are seriously considering acting as a career the prospects for the negro actor in search of a career in the theatre are further lessened by the fact that many producers feel the socalled negro show is not a good financial risk as theatrical investments go compared to investments in white shows they seem to forget about many successful negro shows which have been produced for years one could include among them such plays as green pastures shuffle along porgy and bess carmen jones and emperor jones anna lucasta still remains among the alltime record holders for broadway runs of straight plays paul robesons othello holds the alltime record for the broadway run of a shakespearean play even with the bad judgment exercised by some producers in their selection of negro plays it is quite possible that an objective survey would indicate that there is a greater proportion of success among these negro shows based on the total number produced than white shows under similar circumstances the availability of stars also plays a great part in the decision of producers the legitimate stage has not peculiarly enough developed many negro stars not one of the current crop of luminaries was developed by the theatre and yet plays have been shelved for lack of a competent available negro star of sufficient magnitude to head such productions this does not mean that negro actors are not available who could do just as well or possibly better than the desired stars but the precarious economic position of the commercial theatre does not allow for such experimentation in some lay circles the term star has been used rather loosely to the extent it has lost a great deal of its former meaning except to those producers theatrical investors and others who still know and respect the true meaning of the term frequently actors are referred to as having starred in this or that play when in reality the parts played and the billing if any given these actors are not even comparable to feature recognition in the trade the word star is applied to an actor or actress who has reached a stage of artistic development to the extent that they can lend favorable influence to the box office potential once such personalities have attracted a considerable public following they are in the contractual position to demand that their names now synonymous with a well desired trade mark be placed above the title of the play or directly beneath it in very large letters true in many cases this position is not well earned but such rewards are not without consideration for commercial values opportunities for negro actors in the legitimate theatre are so few it is seldom if ever they can grow steadily to the point where they can reach the star category the legitimate theatre has been forced to borrow negro personalities that have been developed in other media many a star has found his original medium more lucrative though and cannot afford the occasional luxury of doing a play or musical top boxoffice attractions such as lena horne and sammy davis are not always available and quite often the roles to be filled are not suited to the particular talents and personalities of this small group since the employment of negro stars usually means the employment of negro supporting players whenever a play is shelved or abandoned it follows that a number of negro actors have been denied a chance to develop towards the star circle this boxoffice draw of such stars as miss horne and mr davis was demonstrated in their last appearances on broadway both appeared in plays that did not receive very favorable critical comment yet miss hornes vehicle jamaica and mr davis mr wonderful had runs of more than a year mr davis latest musical golden boy is still running at this writing and playing to full capacity each week with no end in sight despite not too favorable reviews without a doubt such plays would have closed long since with lesser names this would be true of shows with white stars as well the existence of the star system today is largely due to the desire of the producer to exploit that which he feels creates in the potential theatregoer a desire to fork over the price of admission in this respect he has created what he now terms a frankenstein essentially a stars success is related to the stars ability to attract customers to the boxoffice the figures on the employment of negroes during the past season as compared to previous seasons are somewhat interesting during the above period the total employment of negro actors on and offbroadway dropped considerably from that of the previous season the total number of jobs filled by negro actors reached a new high during the season figures for the last five years are as follows number shows with integrated casts on bdwy offbdwy jobs available on bdwy offbdwy number shows employing negroes on bdwy offbdwy the drop in the total number of jobs available to negro actors during the season as in certain other past periods is mainly due to the number of shows produced with predominantly or allnegro casts for example during the season three shows porgy and bess tambourines to glory sponono accounted for of the total number of employed that year this was all but of the total that same season offbroadway three shows jericho jim crow ballad for bimshire and cabin in the sky accounted for all but of the total employed in that area a total of shows were produced on broadway last season and during the season the most important figures are those under the heading number of shows with integrated casts these figures indicate parts played by negroes that are not designated by the author as socalled negro parts where race is not thematically necessary to the story and not so directed as to imply racial identification it will be noted that these figures have held up pretty well and in fact increased somewhat in addition to the increasing number of negro artists being used in nonracially designated roles another encouraging factor is the number of negro playwrights whose works have been produced in recent years all of them are not necessarily new playwrights but with the possible exception of langston hughes they are new to broadway and offbroadway such writers as james baldwin leroi jones lorraine hansberry deceased louis peterson ann flagg adrienne kennedy errol john ossie davis william hairston loften mitchell alice childress irving burgie abram hill and william branch have been presented to broadway or offbroadway during the past ten or fifteen years the works of of these writers have been produced during the past five years some of these new playwrights might be classified in the angry young man category who sometimes forget that the primary requisite for a good play is its ability to entertain it must first get and hold the attention of the audience if this is not done one might as well be talking to oneself surely there is a place in the theatre for ideas convictions points of view but the craftsmanship and technique of playwriting must be employed to express these ideas and convictions in terms of good theatre for a number of years the negro writer seemed to approach his work out of a peculiar psychological or doctrinal fixation that is his work takes on a conscious or unconscious protest it is very difficult for him to develop or summon forth that degree of confidence selfassurance and inner dignity to approach his work without a certain degree of emotional preoccupation and sometimes that same emotional preoccupation destroys craftsmanship and technique the result is that the literary work suffers dr alain locke wrote in as follows propaganda pronegro and antinegro has scotched the dramatic potentialities of the subject negro drama especially with the few negro playwrights has the propaganda motive worked havoc they have had the dramatic motive deflected at its source race drama has appeared to them a matter of race vindication and pathetically they have pushed forward their moralistic allegories or mellodramatic protests as dramatic correctives and antidotes for race prejudice today however the negro playwright having become aware of his potential strength in the battle for full citizenship has been able to overcome a certain amount of this emotional preoccupation the result is and will be that his work will take on a higher degree of technical perfection and literary value in addition to the established and promising negro playwrights there is further reason for optimism occasioned by some degree of progress in other areas in recent years one or two stage managers have emerged such as charles blackwell formerly of david merrick productions and now working with harry belafonte james wall working in a similar capacity in television irving vincent maxwell glanville currently playing a role in golden boy and one or two others the work of two negro directors was seen on broadway during the past season frank silvera directed amen corner as well as coproduced the play with mrs nat cole and lloyd richards was represented by the musical i had a ball and he will direct another show this season other negro directors who have directed on or offbroadway during the past two seasons are osceola archer edward cambridge and vinette carroll donald mckayle has established himself as one of the top flight choreographers having served as assistant choreographer for west side story red head and more recently as choreographer for golden boy albert popwell directed the dances for the revival of south pacific at the new york city center others of this group are katherine dunham walter nicks talley beatty and alvin ailey in addition to frank silvera and mrs nat cole irving burgie ellis haislip and ossie davis can be added to the list of negro producers this group as well as the negro playwrights can be very instrumental in expanding opportunities for negroes in the american theatre george mcclain has worked in several management capacities and is now assistant manager of the st james theatre he has served as company manager for several large productions on prebroadway tours dick campbell was company manager for the langston hughes show tambourines to glory and for ballad for bimshire he is currently working for crossroads africa the product originated by rev james robinson and after which the peace corps was patterned one of the more successful talent agents is ernestine mcclendon who holds franchises from all of the major performer unions her clients include almost as many white artists as negroes there is a growing use of negro musicians in the pit orchestras of broadway shows and since the desegregation of the new york locals of the stage hands union negro craftsmen are working the broadway theatres perry watkins veteran negro scenic designer has also produced on broadway he is currently working with duke ellington on his new show civil_rights organizations are beginning to realize that the negro creative artist and particularly the playwright and actor exert the greatest influence in the establishment of the negro image conferences are currently being held with the naacp in the hope of establishing an naacp national performing artists advisory committee as a permanent department within the national office with a staff person on both the east and west coasts to pursue on a continuing basis the ultimate objective of complete desegregation of the performing arts the flight from broadway by ossie dav hen i came to harlem in i joined a flourishing comv munity theatre sponsored by dick campbell and muriel rahn the rose mcclendon players where i got my basic training as an actor and as a playwright it is impossible for me to imagine having had any kind of meaningful life in the theatre without this training and i feel this must have been true for most of the student performers whom i met and worked with there the rose mcclendon players was a community theatre in the true sense of the word it cultivated and serviced the harlem community with highgrade theatrical entertainment which gave negroes a chance to see their own lives reflected on stage at least four plays a season to a subscription audience it gave burgeoning negro playwrights a chancewhich they could get nowhere elseto see their plays mounted and performed and it gave negro actors stage managers set designers and assorted technicians a chance to learn and to practice their craftunder the best instruction with the coming of world war ii the rose mcclendon players disbanded but its work was taken up and advanced by the american negro theatre founded by frederick oneal and abram hill ant as it came to be called was even more intensive and extensive in its operations and from its roster has come such theatre people as oneal himself ruby dee sidney poitier harry belafonte hilda simms earle hyman max glanville and a host of others it is difficult to imagine the american theatrical scene as we know it today in the absence of these performers it is equally difficult to imagine they could have made such an impactive contribution had they not had a theatre workshophad they not had antat which to learn and to practice their craft no further argument is neededit seems to meof the indisputable and irreplaceable value both to actors and playwrights etcand to the harlem community itselfof a community theatre but harlem had had no significant community theatre since ant closed up shop in why i think the decisive answer is that broadway discovered ants production of anna lucasta in and gobbled it up that i believe was the beginning of the end for suddenly there was a place downtown on broadway for negro actors the end of a war fought in part against racial intolerance had come and broadway decided to introduce a new concept of the negro to the american public plays like deep are the roots jeb strange fruit on whitman avenue and later native son all followed anna lucasta and most of the functioning cadre of ant joined the march into the theatrical mainstream there was effort from time to time to fall back and regroup to keep the old establishment going out of the blood sweat and tears of those who remained to the end but it was hopeless the suction the sweeping undercurrent flowing towards broadway only a subway ride away was irresistible and a great community theatre so absolutely essential to the spiritual life of the community passed away almost without protest many regretted its passing who felt that a certain tone a certain richness had gone out of the lives of our people and who sought in various ways and at various times to build up another theatre to replace the one that had flown away on the wings of success but the times were against the idea integration the movement of the negro people outward from their ghetto confinement into the mainstream of american life and culture that was the objective too long had we negro actors playwrights directors etc fought to get onto broadway and been by and large denied too long had we been forced to stand on the outside looking in now that the doors were open at lastor so we thoughtwe must make every effort to move through to stop now and devote any of our time and energy to building a theatre in harlem would be to look backwardsin effect to resegregate ourselves after years of struggling to breakdown segregation no one can deny that integration has come to broadway that though much remains to be done the negro is now included meaningfully in most aspects of broadway life certainly he will not find any statutory limits or barriers to his activities the negro is accepted in a way that was unthinkable prior to anna lucasta but accepted into what broadway itself is in a spiral of inflated production costs which makes it more and more difficult for theatre to dare try and make a real contribution to american culture and rising ticket prices that drive more and more people away from its doors every season and while the negro actor playwright director etc can still look to broadway as an arena for the gainful exercise of his talent that arena itself grows smaller and smaller as every year fewer and fewer plays make it to broadway at all and fewer and fewer of that few survive beyond the first week and what of the negro community or in more up to date terms the negro audience can it hope to have its own spiritual and cultural requirements met on broadway as they formerly were met by the rose mcclendon players and the american negro theatre now when the submerged aspirations of the negro are beginning to surface in a more and more disturbing and revolutionary fashion a la watts can broadway as it now liesslowly dying of economic strangulation its voice essentially inaudible on the burning issues of our time vietnam watts poverty crime mississippi etcreally speak to the needs of the negro community or any other community in the thirties broadway was a cockpit where significant ideas were fought and bled over today it is on television that mccarthy and his ism came a cropper or that south vietnam at last manages to engage the attention of the nation it is a motion picture like dr strangelove that brings us face to face with the realities of atom power politics and even more significantly it is to our novelist and writers of essays that we turn now for serious discussions of our social plight what playwright or play is more relevant to the major turbulences of our timesor can command a larger and more attentive audience than james baldwin and his essays leroi jones and his poems or john o killens and his novels tobacco road was about rural poverty among whites it was of another time and quite successful as good theatre and as social comment such a play of our times about urban poverty among negroes and puerto ricans might do equally well on both counts but plays about negroes especially unpleasant plays about negroesie baldwins blues for mr charlie do not make money what producer knowing todays costs of production would want to risk offending his audiences sensibilities at todays ticket prices incidentally mr baldwins amen corner which was not unpleasantin that it did not make the predominantly white broadway audiences feel guilty was not successful true lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun did make money but her sign in sidney brusteiris window did not my own play purlie victorious stayed on broadway seven and a half months and can be counted an artistic success but phil rose our producer ruby and i had to take money out of our pockets to keep it there money we never got back another play offbroadway in which i was associate producer ballad for bimshire an excellent musical also failed what i am trying to say is that while there are no impediments to plays about the truth of negro experience being produced on broadway such productions so far have not succeededhave not been hits in the sense that anna lucasta was the negro community can find its anguish and its joys mirrored faithfully and profitably in books in magazines and in the news on television but on broadwayno dice the great hope that we would be included into the mainstream american theatrethe hope which led us to abandon our own independent community theatre in harlemhas been realized in form but defeated in substance what shall we do we negroes about our needs for living theatre both as performers and as member of the negro community i think we must first realize what is happening to broadway broadway as we know it is changing theatre is becoming decentralized and americans will in the future look less and less to broadway as the endall and beall of drama just as we no longer look to hollywood for what is of real consequence in motion pictures we too must move with the timesand we are community theatres and repertory acting companies are springing up in various places bent more on serving the needs of their own communities than on trying to imitate broadway a tremendous proliferation of nonbroadway oriented theatre groups is taking place all over our country i am myself a member of the founding committee of the american negro theatre inc which aims to secure foundation grants to build a theatre in harlem already kenneth whitlock with his prospect park summer theatre robert hooks and barbara ann teer with their group theatre workshop roger furman and his new heritage theatre and leroi jones and his black arts theatre are beginning the flight from broadwaythe long trip back home surely we shall see a new community theatrenot only in harlem but in all american communitiesnot yet but soon old habits die slowly and broadway was and is still one of the sentimental landmarks in american culture will hate to see it lose face i will hate to see the sceptre pass to other places than new york but broadway grows less and less able to satisfy the cultural needs not only of the nation but even of new york city itself i believe that we being negroes have a special thing to say to ourselves and to the world of our own daily lives which only theatre can express and believe we have a special need to celebrate the rediscovery of our people which only the theatre can fulfill potentially nobody can make more spiritual capital out of the coming decentralization of the theatre than we canand no other groups need it more than we do broadways loss is bound to be harlems gain at least i hope so and i want to be there when it happens in search of the revolutionary theatre by leroi jones revolutionary the atre should force ii change it should be change ah their faces turned into the lights and you work on them black nigger magic and cleanse them at having seen the ugliness and if the beautiful see themselves they will love themselves we are preaching virtue again but by that to mean now what seems the most constructive uses of the world the revolutionary theatre must expose show up the insides of these humans look into black skulls white men will cower before this theatre because it hates them because they have been trained to hate the revolutionary theatre must hate them for hating for presuming with their technology to deny the supremacy of the spirit they will all die because of this the revolutionary theatre must teach them their deaths it must crack their faces open to the mad cries of the poor it must teach anyone names except common sense the revolutionary theatre should flush the fags and murders out of lincolns face it should stagger through our universe correcting insulting preaching spitting craziness but a craziness taught to us in our most rational moments people must be taught to trust true scientists knowers diggers oddballs and that the holiness of life is the constant possibility of widening the consciousness and they must be incited to strike back against any agency that attempts to prevent this widening the revolutionary theatre must accuse and attack anything that can be accused and attacked it must accuse and attack because it is a theatre of victims it looks at the sky with the victims eyes and moves the victims to look at the strength in their minds and their bodies clay in dutchman ray in the toilet walker in the slave are all victims in the western sense they them about silence and the truths could be heroes but the revolu lodged there it must kill any god tionary theatre even if it is wesern must be antiwestern it must show horrible coming attractions of the crumbling of the west even as artaud designed the conquest of mexico so we must design the conquest of white eye and show the missionaries and wiggly liberals dying under blasts of concrete for sound effects wild screams of joy from all the peoples of the world the revolutionary theatre must take dreams and give them a reality it must isolate the ritual and historical cycles of reality but it must be food for all these who need food and daring propaganda for the beauty of the human mind but it is a political theatre a weapon to help in the slaughter of these dimwitted fatbellied white guys who somehow believe that the rest of the world is here for them to slobber on this should be a theatre of world spirit where the spirit can be shown to be the most competent force in the world force spirit feeling the language will be anybodys but tightened by the poets backbone and even the language must show what the facts are in this consciousness epic whats happening we will talk about the world and the preciseness with which we are able to summon the world will be our art art is method and art like any ashtray or senator remains in the world wittgenstein said ethics and aesthetics are one i believe this so the broadway theatre is a theatre of reaction whose ethics like its aesthetics reflects the spir itual values of this unholy society which sends young crackers all over the world blowing off colored peoples heads in some of these flippy southern towns they even shoot up the immigrants favorite son be it michael schwerner or j f kennedy the revolutionary theatre is shaped by the world and moves to reshape the world using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world we are history and desire what we are and what any experience can make us it is a social theatre but all theatre is social theatre but we will change the drawing rooms into places where real things can be said about a real world or into smoky rooms where the destruction of washington can be plotted the revolutionary theatre must function like an incendiary pencil planted in curtis lemays cap so that when the final curtain goes down brains are splattered over the seats and the floor and bleeding nuns must wire soss to belgians with gold teeth our theatre will show victims so that their brothers in the audience will be better able to understand that they are the brothers of victims and that they themselves are victims if they are blood brothers and what we show must cause the blood to rush so that prerevolutionary temperaments will be bathed in this blood and it will cause their deepest souls to move and they find themselves tensed and clenched even ready to die at what the soul has been taught we will scream and cry murder run through the streets in agony if it means some soul will be moved moved to actual life understanding of what the world is and what it ought to be we are preaching virtue and feeling and a natural sense of the self in the world all men live in the world and the world ought to be a place for them to live what is called the imagination from image magi magic magician etc is a practical vector from the soul it stores all data and can be called on to solve all our problems the imagination is the projection of ourselves past our sense of ourselves as things imagination image is all possibility because from the image the initial circumscribed energy and use idea is possible and so begins that images use in the world possibility is what moves us the popular white mans theatre like the popular white mans novel shows tired white lives and the problems of eating white sugar or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing white businessmen of the world do you want to see people really dancing and singing all of you go up in harlem and get yourself killed there will be dancing and singing then for real in the slave walker vessels the black revolutionary wears an armband which is the insignia of the attacking army a big redlipped minstrel grinning like crazy the liberal white mans objection to the theatre of the revolution if he is hip enough will be on aesthetic grounds most white western artists do not need to be political since usually whether they know it or not they are in complete sympathy with the most repressive social forces in the world today there are more junior birdmen fascists running around the west today disguised as artists than there are disguised as fascists but then that word fascist and with it fascism has been made obsolete by the word america and americanism the american artist usually turns out to be just a superbourgeois because finally all he has to show for his sojourn through the world is better taste than the bourgeois many times not even that americans will hate the revolutionary theatre because it will be out to destroy them and whatever they believe is real american cops will try to close the theatres where such nakedness of the human spirit is paraded american producers will say the revolutionary plays are filth usually because they will treat human life as if it was actually happening american directors will say that the white guys in the plays are too abstract and cowardly dont get me wrong i mean aesthetically and they will be right the force we want is of million spooks storming america with furious cries and unstoppable weapons we want actual explosions and actual brutality an epoch is crumbling and we must give it the space and hugeness of its actual demise the revolutionary theatre which is now peopled with victims will soon begin to be peopled with new kinds of heroes not the weak hamlets debating whether or not they are ready to die for whats on their minds but men and women and minds digging out from under a thousand years of high art and weakfaced dalliance we must make an art that will function as to call down the actual wrath of world spirit we are witchdoctors and assassins but we will open a place for the true scientists to expand our consciousness this is a theatre of assault the play that will split the heavens for us will be called the destruction of america the heroes will be crazy horse denmark vesey patrice lumumba but not history not memory not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our despair these will be new men new heroes and their enemies most of you who are reading this on way u by robert burg lmost everyone in the western hemisphere has heard of sir laurence olivier the great english actor who has starred in the theater and on motion picture screens but who pray tell is james earl jones the two namesone so famous the other practically unknown came into juxtiposition last year when life magazine ran a review of an offbroadway production of othello which featured jones in the title role coincidently sir laurence was and at this writing still is playing the same part in a british revival of the ancient play lifes reviewer compared the acting styles of the two men and concluded that jones more than held his own with his completely individual completely absorbing portrayal of the moor of venice in one respect at least sir laurence was laboring under a handicap which several earlier critics had pointed out being white he had to resort to some rather eyestopping and from the critics point of view distracting blackface makeup to more properly assume the role of othello who was a negro jones had no such problemhe is a negro james earl jones is years old is a little on the heavy side although hes tall which compensates for this and has what many theatergoers and reviewers acknowledge to be a most incredibly striking face one that is massive and almost biblical in appearance because of the thick bushy beard that curves around it thick black eyebrows top off this imposing combination of facial features and lend to jones an air of intensity that is just right for the moor of venice he is a bachelor who lives in a messy tworoom flat in new yorks lower east side and his one interest appears to be acting indeed this young man seems to eat sleep and live acting and it is possible just possible that someday his name may be as wellknown as sir laurence olivier at the present however jones is just one of several dozen very talented actors who are littleknown in the new york theater world bobbing about in lowbudget productions and waiting to be noticed by top producers unlike his struggling colleagues though jones is more than satisfied to be where he is at this particular point in time in a profession famous for its stars this is one man who is seriously pursuing his career by acting and studying and who professes that he is totally uninterested in the tinsel glamour that accompanies the hollywood brand of stardom a glance at his theatrical record reveals the deliberateness and purpose that mark his budding career he has had a string of roles which taken together comprise a fine apprenticeship in the theater he has run the gamut from comic roles such as the whimsical cannibal hired to eat the heros motherinlaw in the love nest to more serious portrayals such as the dignified prince of morocco in the merchant of venice and the older brother in the cool world which played briefly on broadway before being made into a film yet despite these and many other parts jones is in no hurry to make a name for himself each week he takes the subway to the actors studio to sit in as an observer on study and criticism sessions and on monday his day off from the theater he is usually in the audience of current plays looking analyzing and even enjoying despite all of this activity and experience this tall handsome actor still must face the obvious question of just how far a serious dedicated negro can go in the american theater below the star level of people like sidney poitier and lena horne and sammy davis jr there are dozens perhaps even a few hundred negroes in show business who exist in a large gray area where nothing ever seems to happen beyond a hardly noticeable role in an occasional play or film is it possible to break out of this area to bigger and better parts jones refuses however to view the theater strictly from the viewpoint of being a negro opportunities for actors in general could be better he saysand means it this is not to say that jones is completely unaware of the color of his skin far from it there are always little incidents that serve to remind him that he is a negro a few years ago for example he was playing the part of the bombadier in the motion picture dr strangelove in the tense climactic scene in which the american plane is rocked by a soviet missile jones was being carefully instructed by the director stanley kubrick kubrick told him to look upward in fright at the moment of the explosion with the camera very low looking up at me jones recalls i thought to myself sonofabitch this guy wants me to roll my eyes if it wasnt kubrick i wouldve said are you trying to get a stepin fetchit effect or something actually i think he almost wanted that effect he wanted simply to suggest it to awaken in the observers mind the particular image of the negro in trouble an even more subtle complication of his being a negro as it relates to the theater is that joness skin is of a medium shade and his nose is slim and conservative in appearance thus when he comes on stage the audiencewhile naturally recognizing him as a negro may find itself more readily able to identify with him than with a darkerskinned actor the writer of a play in which he was understudy to the lead once approached him and told him jimmy i think that if you were out there the audience might identify better with the character the actor in the lead naturally was several shades darker than jones while he may have his sensitivities about being negro there is no question that jones is proud of what he is i dont want to go on stage and eliminate my negritude he says flatly i think theres something so exciting about being what you are whether its being seven feet tall or black or blonde that you shouldnt want to disguise it or pretend it isnt there many white liberals who have applauded the recent trend toward casting negroes in parts that would normally go to white actors or actresses such as ruby dee playing cordelia in king lear will be drawn up short by joness attitude toward this development he does not want to be so integrated into a play as to lose his identity as a negro jones definitely wants parts that are meant to be played by negroes only he has set up an inflexible condition that an audience must recognize him for what he is a black man and then it must accept him this way he is interested in exploring and developing his blackness and in using it unashamedly in the theater ive always wanted to play mephistopholes and emphasize all of his black aspects he says for all of these conditions and demands on an audience jones is resignedat least for the present to the fact that it takes theatergoers a few minutes to get used to him as a negro before it can accept him as a character in the play they never really identify he says but they come much closer to it the deeper into the character i get as an actor i found that people cry watching othello in the moment of his agony and at that moment they necessarily have to forget what he is even bull connor would cry watching othello in spite of himself its that deep psychic defense that people have thats a hard thing to crack it keeps them from accepting negroes in certain capacities to illustrate what he means jones summons up the story of the time he was sitting in a movie theater watching a newsreel about the korean war when a scene flashed on the screen showing american soldiers both white and black in action together a woman sitting nearby jones suddenly jumped up and said in very shocked tones to her companion they dont have negroes in the front lines one need go no further than the television set to see this kind of mentality in action jones believes he points out that tv commercials are a field that is now opening up to negro actorsif they are the right shade theyre trying to do token integration he asserts take a soap commercial lets say its important for the producers to show a negro woman using smiths soapflakes well its almost as important not to have her so specifically negro that anyone couldnt identify with her you recognize the shade and thats the token as a negro in a profession that makes strenuous physical and mental demands on those who pursue it jones has more than once been confronted with the conflict of making a choice of which comes firstcivil_rights or art occasionally he is able to successfully combine one with the other as when he participated in a taped television program about the three civil_rights workers who were murdered in mississippi not long ago it was during this taping that he was confronted with yet another manifestation of the same basic dilemma one of the men in the television studio who had been working with the student nonviolent coordinating committee approached him and tried to talk him into going into the south and working for civil_rights there jones reluctantly turned him down i think if i went down there he says i would have to devote myself to it totally and if i did that i dont think i would take the choice that james foreman or martin_luther_king takes i think i would take the choice of malcolm_x to cope with that situation there is need for that kind of pressure rather than the moral pressure because morality is long gone the more militant black leaders who say that the solution is economics in the north and force in the south are right i mean for now maybe some day morality will be the solution i dont know the curious thing about jones is that even while he is talking about the oppression of negroes in america there is no bitterness in his voice it is as if he were talking about oppressors he has heard about but never met almost in the same breath he will say i dont know what christ was talking about but he was onto something his conviction that malcolm_x had the right approach to the race conflict may even be somewhat explained by his interest in the assassinated black nationalist as a dramatic character id like to perform malcolm_x he says id like to explore with an audience and a director and other actors that phenomenon that was called malcolm_x this last statement isnt surprising when you understand that jones looks on the theater as a pressure chamber where invisible forces froth and boil over indeed it is possible that for him as for other dedicated actors an understanding of life is acquired on the stage in that electric moment when there is that unity of spirit and concentration between actor and audience in that moment when the spark of life leaps from a script jones says that he cannot go onto the stage to pretend to be someone hes not at the same time he may often go before an audience and discover in the character something of himself which until that moment lay below the threshold of his awareness apart from these abstractions of exploration and discovery jones is concerned with the more downtoearth techniques and tools of his profession he is a hard worker for his role in othello he steeped himself in the maze of theories hypothesized by shakespearian scholars to explain the personality of the darkskinned general jones has learned that an actors concentration can be one of his most useful tools gene frankel a new york director and drama teacher taught me that he says concentration on what youre doing on stage on your part is largely responsible for involving your audience you can even be doing bad work but if your concentration is strong enough theyll watch your bad work rather than their dates or the people in the next row i can sense their involvement when my own involvement in the part is strong enough if im too busy watching to see if ive got them i dont get them its like zen its a yoga of acting you do it and then you know it its a matter of total commitment along with these techniques jones has also developed a philosophical attitude toward assessing the value of his own work which other actors might envy there are neither successes nor failures he says i think ive committed myself as best i could to everything ive done if an artist looks at himself objectively he wont see himself in terms of success or failure thats usually for somebody elses judgment joness ambition is to be a great actor that is to be able to play a particular role better than anyone else who had the same kind of talents and skills in an offmoment once jones admitted my life is sort of funny in a way i go around as if the sky could fall in on me at any moment although so far it hasnt lately he hasnt had much chance to check the sky hes too busy making a living in the theater the tattered queens by ruby dee hen about w i first learned the death of dorothy dandridge a tremendous sadness came over me id known her slightly only really over the years our paths had never crossed in workoccasionally socially but i had seen her mostly as an actress and remembered with joy her beautiful performance as carmen in the movie carmen jones i felt i knew her as well as i knew myself what as a young performer she aspired to what she had to settle forthe active search for opportunities the sporadic success the long periods of nothing to look forward to the deliberate pretense of indifference the deep selfdoubt a major role then waiting waiting she was lucky for her career as an actress began with a head start as a singer and between the betweens she could fill club dates how fortunate not to be just an actress i wondered if the tragedy of dorothy was not indeed the tragedy of all negro actresses i worked with an actress once in a huge theatre in the bronx in a playarsenic and old lace i had vaguely known of her what style she had i recall thinking what grace i wondered where she had been trained there was something about her personalitydistinctly royal profoundly human she might have played any role from a queen to a peasant representing any race her name was abbie mitchell she had worked with some of the leading talents of the early s she had been acor country abbie mitchell cicely tyson claimed here but mostly in europe an extraordinary soprano a prima donna i felt fortunate that our lives had touched at the time of our meeting i was quite young and coming along well for a colored girl at the time i believe that often young performers lacking a continuity of experience lacking a knowledge of history of entertainment of the tradition and great contribution that our people have made to the theatre may tend to feel that a whole new world begins with each newcomer not so inspired by abbie mitchell i began to read books about and by negro performers i am deeply grateful to such people as james weldon johnson tom fletcher and edith isaacs for having written on the subject it was through their books that i began to feel a sense of belonging somewhere as an actress as part of a tradition id almost missed knowing abbie mitchell where was her scrapbook where was there a more complete description of her life couldnt my husband ossie davis write her story as a play why didnt talk to her more ask her what it is like to reach the top is there a top for negro actresses why wasnt she as well known and as frequently employed as the leading white performers of the time retired why what would she play next it was some years later by then after talking about her after asking other older performers who came out of retirement about her i finally wrote her asking for an appointment the letter came back unanswered unopened it was marked deceased rose mcclendon and the famous walk down those stairs even ethel barrymore complimented her for it with kindness that comes only from being white regularly employed and nationally recognized who was she had she worked in more than the half a dozen plays id seen referred to where was there a record of her accomplishments i remember tall sensitive edna thomas why dont i see her on television sometimes or broadwayon or off retired now perhaps but because she wants to be it seems that negro actresses enjoyed a fuller creative life in the old community theatre eg the allnegro lafayette players such actresses as edna thomas hilda offley evelyn ellis and laura bowman knew and benefitted from working in stock companies they had a chance to more fully explore the depths of their talent they were not primarily restricted to plays about negroes one may be extremely talented but only constant exposure makes a performer stageworthy and cameraworthy i never heard of a negro starlet with a seven year contract learning the ropes in b movies and studio schools quite a few moderately talented white actresses have blossomed into fame and fortune under such attention what might have happened to dorothy dandridge with a sevenyear contract and the security that goes with it we actresses are so accustomed to the fact that performers such as ethel waters lena horne beah richards pauline myers jane white hilda simms and claudia mcneil have no part in television or work regularly in stock that we stop trying we hear talk of integration and things getting better and indeed there are some marvelous integrated commercials and more negro actors appearing in incidental parts and every now and then racially mixed leads and an occasional allnegro show but these are isolated instances not a trend indicating that things may be somewhat better in an individual sense group participation in the creative life of the country is less than ever we cannot grow in isolation the negro actress is still acting on the fringes not really a part only occasionally let in better off portraying the prostitute the second roles written with not enough imagination and truth we can point to no one of us who has the remotest chance of reaching the prominence of helen hayes ethel barrymore bette davis etc no one with that kind of economic opportunity either we dream we scream we pretend we picket or like some other of our most gifted mildred joan smith muriel smith marion douglaswe quit will the newer names on the horizonlike cicely tyson and diana sands and gloria fosterescape the paucity of opportunity that always seems to follow occasional spurts of comparative good fortune for colored stars when we talk or write about ourselves and our place in american society so much is necessarily a lament but perhaps a look at stark reality may help clarify and make objective our grievances indicate alternatives to despair through some program of action i fully realize the cultural poverty that is abroad in the land leading white actresses are afflicted by some of the same ills that affect the negro actress their lowest level of employment is however often commensurate with our highest there are many more parts written for men than women white and black but my concern here is with the negro actress who faces double discriminationthat of sex and that of race what must we do we negro actresses to be saved we must most certainly make a determined effort to encourage our playwrightsparticularly female to write for all media there is a kind of autocracy about an entertainereach one sort of spinning around in a personal orbit on individual momentum i maintain that we actresses must concern ourselves more with the fate of each other and of the younger actresses coming along by helping to find material and getting it produced by promoting scholarships for intensive training we must also see to it that the new theatres springing up over the country include negro actors as basic and intrinsic parts of their companies indeed the future of the theatre may lie in repertory companies and on the road in the past musicianssingers and instrumentalistsfared better in relation to their art than we have they have been for the most part innovators and pacesetters top money and opportunity however still go to their white imitators innovators in song dance and language theirs is a development springing from the soul roots of our people but that same soul roots truth of the lives of our people has yet to be explored in drama we know best on stage and screen the prostitute the negro maid as a person rather than a stereotype the negro mother the average woman and the middleclass woman have for the most part yet to be dealt with in depth this holds true of the heroines of our history also we must ask our playwrights to do better by us we do have as a people an address to life a cry a joy that is particularly ours that has yet to be fully and unselfconsciously put forward women must become producerspioneering and prospecting among our own for backing i am particularly gratified at the work done in this connection by maria cole and juanita poitier we must see to it that our young people consider the very important backstage and olfcamera roles as technicians more people see films than ever go to the theatre if one of the purposes of art is to effect change we must make every effort to become proficient in every phase of film making working for inclusion in american films at every possible level the reality is that we are but per cent of a population which is geared to segregate and to discriminateimproving i believe but desperately in need of artistic effort to help change the image of the negro and so effect social change more quickly as art not only reflects life but also influences it we must dedicate ourselves to the improvement of life and its truthsabout women about negroes the negro actress cannot afford to be isolated from this effort we must not evade the fact that in todays america most negro stars are at best tattered queens haunted always by an aura of tragedy failure and defeat but we must not be defeated with a sober look at what is happening with us today we must make every effort to make things better for those who will come after us and i would especially encourage those young women of my race most likely to be overlookedthe very black the very africanesque to study and to work i believe they have shied away from theatre because their particular kind of beauty has not only not been encouraged but has been heretofore too often rejected but how else can a people know its own beauty except that those artists most representative of it come forth and tell it the fairskinned those nearer to caucasian in appearance and manners have always fared better in our theatre but are we not basically of african descent in the better times to come there will be equal place on our stage and screens for all shades all types all colors we must see to it that this is so theatre the negro in and out by james baldwin t is a sad fact that i have rarely seen a nej gro actor really well used on the american stage or screen or on television i am not trying to start an artificial controversy when i say this for in fact most american performers seem to find themselves trapped very soon in an iron maiden of mannerisms somehow the achieved record falls below the promise henry fonda for example is one of the most accomplished actors around but i find it very difficult to watch him because most of the roles he plays do not seem to me to be worth doing moreover it would seem to me that his impulse as an actor is very truthful but the roles he plays are not his physical attributes and his quality of painful halting honesty are usually at the mercy of some mediocre playwrights effort to justify the bankruptcy of the american male eg the nebbish with whom he so gallantly struggles in two for the seesaw the point is that one can attend the broadway theatre and most of the offbroadway theatre all season long without ever being moved or terrified or engaged the spectacle on the stage does not attempt to recreate our experiencethus helping us to deal with it the attempt is almost always in the opposite direction to justify our fantasies thus locking us within them now the figure of the negro is at the very heart of the american confusion much of the american confusion if not most of it is a direct result of the american effort to avoid dealing with the negro as a man the theatre cannot fail to reflect this confusion with results which are unhealthy for the white actor and disastrous for the negro the character a white actor is called on to play is usually a wishful fantasy the person not as he is but as he would like to see himself it need scarcely be said therefore that the situations the playwright invents for this person have as their principal intention the support of this fantasy the caine mutiny court martial a majority of one tea and sympathy and tall story are all utterly untruthful plays the entire purpose of the prodigies of engineering skill expanded on them is to make the false seem true and this cannot fail finally to have a terrible effect on the actors art for the depths out of which true inspiration springs are precisely the depths he is forbidden to reach i am convinced that this is one of the reasons for the nerve wracking busyness of our stagekeep moving maybe nobody will notice that nothings happeningand the irritating self indulgent mannerisms of so many of our actors in search of a truth which is not in the script they are reduced to what seem to be psychotherapeutic exercises listening to actors talk about the means they employ to justify this line or that action is enough to break the heart and set the teeth on edge sometimes the actor finds that no amount of skill will justify or cover up the hollowness or falsity of what he is called on to do this is where the director comes in it would seem that much of his skill involves keeping everything moving at such a clip and to have so many things happening at once that the audience will remain in effect safely protected from the play if this is true for the white actor it is unimaginably worse for the negro actor the characters played by white actors however untruthful they may essentially be do dependon the accumulation of small very carefully observed detail thus chester morris playing a thoroughly unreal father in blue denim yet mimics the type so well that it is easy to be misled into believing that you once knew someone like him but the characters played by negro actors do not have even this advantage white people do not know enough about negro life to know which details to look for or how to interpret such details as may have been forced on their attention to take one of the many possible examples the scene in reginald roses black monday in which juano hernandez is beaten to death hernandez plays a janitor in the deep south you will remember who is opposed to integration he does not believeso he informs a marvelously mocking and salty hilda simmsin pushing himself in where he is not wanted he is also telling this to his twelve year old grandson who is beginning somewhat improbably to wonder if he is as good as white people now of course we have all met such janitors and such negroes but their tone is very different and their tone betrays what they really feel however servile they may appear to be there is always a murderous rage or a murderous fear or both not quite sleeping at the very bottom of their hearts and minds the truth is that they do not have any real respect for white people they despise them and they fear them they certainly do not trust them and when such a man confronts his nephew or his grandson no matter what he says there cannot fail to be brought alive in him envy and terror and love and hate he has always hated his condition even though he feared to change it even though he may no longer be able to admit it if the playwright does not know this as on the evidence i gather mr rose did not he cannot draw the character truthfully and the actor who plays him is seriously handicapped this shows very painfully in the scene in which hernandez meets his death his reaction to the effigy of a hanged negro in spite of all mr hernandezs skill is false this is not the first time he has seen such an effigy and if he has been living in that town all his life it is simply not possible for the white people there to surprise himat least they cannot surprise him by being wicked or by being afraid they have always been that and he knows that about them if he knows nothing else any negro facing in such a town three overheated white boys knows what he is in for he can try to outwit flatter cajole them put them at their ease by humiliating himselfthough at this point the spectacle of his humiliation is probably not enough to set them at their ease or if the chips are really at last thank heaven down he can resolve to take one of them with him and even if all the foregoing guesswork is wrong one thing remains indisputable once attacked he would certainly not be trying to get past his attackers in order to go to work not on that morning not in that school not with death staring at him out of the eyes of three young white men all of the training therefore all of the skill which mr hernandez has acquired to say nothing of his talentfor it took a vast amount of talent to bring lucas in intruder in the dust aliveis here not merely wasted which would be bad enough it is subverted sabotaged put at the mercy of a lie for the wellspring on which the actor must draw which is his own sense of life and his own experience is precisely here what mr hernandez cannot use if he had it would have torn the scene to pieces and altered the course of the play for the plays real intention after all is to say something about the integration struggle without saying anything about the root of it if you will examine the play carefully you will find that the only really wicked people in the play are wicked because they are insane they are covered therefore and the crimes of the republic are hidden if we get rid of all these mad people the play seems to be saying well get together and everything will be all right the realities of economics sex politics and history are thus swept under the rug now the negro actor after all is also a person and was not born two seconds before he enters the casting office by the time he gets to that office he has probably been an elevator boy a cab driver a dishwasher a porter a longshoreman his blood is already thick with humiliations and if he has any sense at all he knows how small are his chances of making it in the theatre he does a great deal of acting in the casting office more probably than he will ever be allowed to do onstage and whatever his training he is not there to get a role he really wants to play he is there to get a role which will allow him to be seen it is all too likely that he has seen actors inferior to himself in training and talent rise far above him and now here he is once more facing an essentially ignorant and uncaring white man or woman who may allow him to play a butler or a maid in the show being cast he dissembles his experience in the office and he knows that he will probably be lying about it onstage he also knows why it is because nobody wants to know the story it would upset them to begin analyzing all of his probable reactions would take all of the space of this magazine and then some but resentment is compounded by the fact as a negro actress once observed to me that not only does the white world impose the most intolerable conditions on negro life m they also presume to dictate the mode manner terms and style of one s reaction against these conditions or as a negro playwright tells it explaining how ketti frings came to adapt richard wrights long dream for the stage she was sitting by this swimming pool see and reading this book and she thought this would make a perfectly darling play so she wrote the first few scenes and called out her negro butler chauffeur and maid and read it to them and asked now isnt that the way you poor downtrodden colored people feel about things why yes miss frings they answered and i thought so says the playwrightand so we go on and on and on the point is that the theatre is perishing for the lack of vitality vitality humanly and artistically speaking has only one source and that source is life now the life actually being led on this continent is not the life which we pretend it is white men are not what they take themselves to be and negroes are very differentto say the very leastfrom the popular image of them this image must be cracked not only if we are to achieve a theatre for we do not really have a theatre now only a series of commercial speculations which result in mammoth musicals and daring plays like compulsion and inherit the wind which are about as daring as a spayed tomcatthis image must be cracked if we intend to survive as a nation the negroinamerica is increasingly the central problem in american life and not merely in social terms in personal terms as well i intend from time to time in discussing the theatre to return to this point for think the time has come to begin a bloodless revolution only by a more truthful examination of what is really happening here can we realize the real aims of the theatre which are to instruct through terror and pity and delight and love the only thing we can now do for the tired business man is to scare the living daylights out of him both the albee plays at the york theatrethe death of bessie smith and the american dreamleft me rather waiting for the other shoe to fall both plays seemed to promise more than they delivered but i am not at all certain that i know what it is that they promised this is not by the way meant as a complaint or as a joke i dont mindin the theatre at any ratehaving my cozy expectations swept out from under me and im the type that enjoys being forced to ask myself just what the author had in mind i was hardly ever moved to the heart as we say by either of the albee plays but i was mystified enraged amused and horrified i dont know if you will like them or not but i think you ought to see them to take the plays in the order in which they were presented the death of bessie smith takes place in the deep south much of it in a thoroughly demoralizing hospital there is not a single attractive person in this play unless one excepts the offstage bessie smith and the goodnatured but simpleminded type who takes her on the journey which ends in her death neither bessie nor this man have much to do with the main action of the play there is a question in my mind as to whether they really do much to illuminate it but we will discuss this in a moment in the course of the play bessie smith dies offstage and this is the extent on the surface anyway of herconnection with this drama the plays principal concerni thinkis with the character of a white southern nurse character is perhaps not quite the word i want rarely has less character been presented at greater or more unsympathetic length i hesitate possibly because i am a coward to suppose this creature is intended in any way to represent the fair ladies of the south and yet she is clearly of no interest in herself except clinically and i must add that as i watched her my own memories of southern faces came flooding back bringing with them the nearcertainty that this horror this emptiness might very well be what the southern faceand particularly the faces of the womenhide i imagine that anyone who is old enough will not fail to be reminded of the faces and the personalities of the women who accused the scottsboro boys of rape we first encounter this woman with her fatherand they deserve each otheron the porch of their home she is icily and methodically and not for the first time they certainly have nothing else to talk aboutpuncturing his delusions as to his person his political ambitions and his friendship with the mayor who is a patient in the hospital where she works on the admissions desk the relationship between the father and daughter is absolutely unspeakable as are almost all the other relationships in this play but i was puzzled as to what precisely mr albee wished me to make of it it is a relationship which like the character of the nurse is really of no interest in itself it being doomed by the lack of resources in the people to be static they will have this conversation over and over then they will die or the curtain will fall and what either we or they have learned in the meantime is a question it may be that mr albees intention was to reveal as forcefully as possible the depth of the southern poverty and paranoia and the extent of the sexual ruin but if this is so then i think he has miscalculated i sympathize with him in the dilemma to which his raw material his personages have drawn him i am an american writer too and i know how it sets the teeth on edge to try to create out of people clearly incapable of itincapable of selfexamination of thought or literally of speechdrama that will reveal them but the solution is not to my mind to present these people as they see themselves or as they are we must be enabled to see them as they have been or as they might become otherwise we merely judge them as specimens and feel nothing for them as human beings it has perhaps never been more difficult than it is now to illuminate the person beleagured and bewildered by the irresponsibility and provincialism and worship of mediocrity which he in his innocence mistakes for democracy on the other hand it has possibly never been more important so that i do not object to the deadly hysterical stasis of the nurse but to the fact that mr albee never forces me to identify her inhumanity her poverty her terror with my own for in essence the passionless brimstone exchanges which open the play are the play the tone never changes and we never learn very much more about the nurse or the other people in the play or about the community in which the action takes place there is an arresting sequence between the nurse and a negro orderly but i must confess that the intention here was hopelessly muddled for me by the castingi could not tell at once whether harold scott was playing a white man or a light negro and when it was clear that he was playing a negro i found myself distracted by the question of whether any negro in the deep south would so expose himself to this white witch i did not know what to make of the interne a dull type at best it seemed to me and whatever sympathy i might have been expected to feel for him was demolished by his incomprehensible passion to take the nurse to bed whatever for this leaves i believe only the brief appearance of another wonderfully distracted nurse the offstage bessie and her last paramour and here again either i have totally misunderstood mr albees intention or he has miscalculated i expected at some point in the play some ruthless flash which would illuminate the contrast between the wonderfully reckless life and terrible death of bessie smith and the whited sepulchre in which the nurse is writhing but this does not happen bessie smith bleeds to death the nurse is the only character who knows who she is earlier her father had protested her addiction to nigger musicand the nurse succumbs to hysteria she announces that she too can sing and horribly tries i think i understand mr albees intention here all right but i think it fails of its effect because there is no agony in it people pay for the lives they lead and the crimes they commit and the bloodguiltiness from which they flee whether they know they do or not the effort not to know what one knows is the most corrupting effort one can makewhich the nurse abundantly proves but the anguish which comes when the buried knowledge begins to force itself to the light which must be what is happening to the nurse upon the death of bessie smithhas driven countless thousands to madness or murder or grace but certainly far beyond hysteria the american dream turns out to be the gelded youth so admired here and now it presents a much more bland and amusing surface but can scarcely qualify obviously as a funny play its vision of the antiseptic passivity of american life and the resulting death of the masculine sensibility makes it more closely resemble a nightmare i cannot synopsize this play which offers even less in the way of story and even more in the way of incident than bessie smith it begins at a marvelous clip making its deadly observations with a salty impertinent speed ive got a right to all your money when you die says mommy to daddy because i used to let you lie on top of me and bump your uglies daddy needless to say has long since given that up but it goes flat about halfway and finally surrenders much too quietly i came away with the feeling that it was a far better play than the author realized and that he had given it up much too soon or that both plays were exercises notes for work which mr albee has yet to do i imagine that he will find it necessary to do much more violence to theatrical forms than he has so far done if he is to get his story told it is possible that what i am really complaining about here is a certain coldness intrinsic to albee which will always mar his work but i doubt this for one thing the venom which has gone into the portaits of the nurse in bessie smith and the parents in american dream does not argue too great a detachment but too indignant a distaste and he has a strange way with language a beat which is entirely his which may be controlled by the head but which seems to be dictated from the guts by dennis m blan wo small negro boys stood on the sidewalk as another passed by one said he believes people are prejudiced against him because of his color the other boy asked how can we convince him its not worth the effort the boy replied you just cant teach some people to hate this comic scene was observed by thousands of americans from philadelphia to oakland calif for the first time in the past decade of tense civil_rights conflicts and for that matter at any time in americas history people are invited to laugh withnot atthe trials and tribulations of the negro in the funnies it is a rare occasion indeed nothing has been more sadly neglected in the field of cartoon humor than the negro the door was opened by berkeley california cartoonist morrie turnerthe first negro to be syndicated in the funnies through his integrated comic strip wee pals introduced just one year ago wee pals is now seen by readers of ten major metropolitan newspapers it first appeared in negro digest whose readers also enjoy morries humor in hue his characters all childrenone negro boy wears a confederate capbounce with life and welcome freshness satirizing the foibles of the american negro and the realities of his relationship with the white man the humor of wee pals carries the knockout punch of a prizefighter the philosophical wit of charlie schulzs peanuts and morries own special brand of love and humor he quickly points out that it will not be strictly devoted to negroes but will deal also with the injustices of all minority races as soon as i learn how to draw an indian without using a feather its humor involving integration comments cartoonist dave berger i think its a terrific potential for newspapers says one newspaper editor morrie turners wee pals says what all of us feel but have been afraid to say with humor i dont believe editors are ready to accept this thing turner says perhaps negro humor is not yet ripe for public acceptance as morrie believes but he cannot discount the overwhelming response already by his readers perhaps also morrie says if newspapers were more competitive they would be more willing to give wee pals a chance morries humor charades life with embarrassing and honest realism the youngster who wears the confederate cap was introduced in a sequence carrying a confederate flag in front of two other boys one turns to the other and says obviously american history is not a required subject of the kindergarten class as a cartoonist morrie constantly seeks out his own selfconfidence in each daily strip i die a thousand deaths over each idea as he puts it a selftrained graphic artist morrie toys with each new situation often concerned that it will be understood and liked maybe i worry unnecessarily how others will take it he says many of his faithful fans and close friends often see something else in the scenes and their own interpretation helps them to identify with the characters as wee pals comes to life in americas newspapers they became a living institution for morrie sometimes it seems like they come to life and almost draw the strip for me he explained even though his multiracial cast of children go nameless they are confined to a particular role because of their color or dress in one situation for example a white youngster wearing glasses tells his friend a negro boy here comes a couple of kids ill demonstrate my theory as they approach he slaps a chinese boy in the face a girl standing nearby socks the bespeckled boy in the face in the last panel we see him lying on the ground gamely declaring see its like i told you hate breeds hate the words hate and racism are used cleverly by morrie without bitterness but certainly with a touch of sadness in situations that have heavy moral overtones at morrie turner and his wee pals which he originally wanted to call dinky fellas are fighting their way to the top for a cartoonistany cartoonist success comes hard in the face of stiff competition from those who have made it and those who are flooding the market with an overabundance of new ideas the son of a pullman porter morrie was raised in oakland the neighboring metropolitan city to berkeley where he lives with his wife letha and young son morrie jr in a comfortable home as a young boy drawing came naturally to morrie in grammar school one of his doodles of a football game with all players was framed by the principal and proudly displayed on his office wall because it had so much action in it morrie has been drawing ever since even during world war ii while morrie was serving with the armyair forces th bomber group his cartoons were providing laughter for the soldiers married shortly after the war morrie made a living for awhile as a freelance artist and then went to work as a police clerk in to support his family by he decided it was time to find his own soapbox since leaving the police department he has spent fulltime creating negro humor during these years however morrie has produced more than cartoons for different magazines ranging from true to better homes and gardens the development of wee pals was influenced by comedian dick gregory and charlie schulz whom morrie idolizes as one of the cartoon greats his original allnegro cast was flatly rejected by several major syndicates including united features which handles peanuts whose executives told morrie wee pals would not be a profitable venture nevertheless morrie did not give up his big break finally came a little more than a year ago while the strip was running in a hometown negro newspaper the berkeley post it immediately caught the eye of lew little head of a san francisco syndicate who convinced morrie to integrate the strip in the first week little sold it to the oakland tribune which bills morrie as one of its former carrier boys and other major dailies quickly followed suit including the richmond citizen in tennessee in just the short time that wee pals has been before the public it has found a welcome reception the womens antidefamation league of philadelphia recently honored morrie with its humanitarian award the tribune and the los angeles times which also publishes wee pals have nominated him for the national conference of jews and christians brotherhood award morrie is now producing another integrated army situation strip for the chicago defender called dogbert it carries biting humor and gives morrie a chance to let off steam says morrie candidly where do i go from here problems facing negro actors by woodie king jr he problems of the negro actor are not so much the negro actors problem as they are the white ameriwhen an american negro actor is faced with playing a character he must also confront a trio of problems first should the character be american in its truest sense when american life is most american it is apt to be most theatrical says ralph ellison second should he be negro as negroes really are or negro as we have led whites to believe we are in order to endure and third should the character be american negro the peculiar sensation doubleconsciousnessan american a negro w e b dubois these problems are not easily solved since white america has already told us what the answers are going to be if we intend to act on its stage an old negro actor told me he hated leroi jones two plays the slave and the toilet because they were too filled with protest his student a young beginner agreed with him even to the point of accusing the plays of being vulgar the strange thing was that the beginner had no idea of the kind of plays or the problems the old actor faced during the thirties and forties no idea of the vast history of his craft i will get back to this a little later it was a strange conversation the old actor putting down jones for protest writing and at the same time telling me acting in the thirties had life vitality federal theatre negro macbeth roll sweet chariot run little children and the actors leigh whipper edna thomas son you ought a been there beginners interested beginners view bad road companies inexperienced stock companies and cute community food digesters these prospective actors watch plays and actors that say absolutely nothing the parts the actors play are not worth the time and efforts put into them beginners watch plays that do not attempt to recreate our experiences they watch cute white plays because that is all white america wants a negro actor can sometimes be found in these cute little comedies anniversary waltz come blow your horn enter laughing kiss and tell or something similar his first lines set the negro beginners teeth on edge the embarrassed prospective actor glances about the white theater all the white faces are laughing at the excessive and ridiculous mannerisms the white director has given the negro actor if he makes it the beginner is thinking this must not happen to him he must do exactly as the white actors else the audience will laugh at him simply for being a negro on the stage too but the beginner doesnt know that white people in general dont know enough about negro life to know which details to look for how to absorb the interpretation the negro actor wants to present after reading more plays and how to act books he assumes that he is ready to be henry fonda marlon brando sidney poitier cary grant sir laurence olivier etc he scouts until he finds a white theatre group needing a flat painter carpenter coffee boy etc however before he can get this job he must be able to intellectually discuss sartre albee pinter ionesco beckett brecht and stanislavski he can name a hundred white actors but he cant name five negro actors this is a sad fact recently i talked to a young actress who is paying a great deal of money for acting and singing lessons she had never heard of w c handy or charlie parker and knew absolutely nothing about the history of the negro theatre yet the beginner can tell one everythingafter two months with the white group about the white theatre he will argue about staging a play about what a writer means about the way he would tackle a role if he ever played one finally the little social group will do a little comedy and the negro beginner will be given a cute little buddy part and the white audiences will laugh at him exactly as they had done at the plays he had watched that featured professional negro actors the beginner will eventually learn the truth about all the little social groups he will begin to doubt when white beginners continue to get leading roles no matter how bad they are while he paints sets and occasionally is rewarded with a walkon or a buddy part or perhaps it will be while reading j marriots massive book on the theatre in which the author warns beginners whites against getting with those little groups and working like a nigger forever he learns after about two years of hard labor that sartre and beckett are only talk with these little groups and that they had no intention of using him except as comic relief university theatre the negro actor enrolls believing he will appear in the plays because he will be a student paying tuition to learn all phases of the theatre however he will not be taught all phases of theatre at a university least of all acting again he is left out because the selections are mostly classics or some other form of archaic theatre that was written when the black man did not figure into the scheme of white america and we know that the professors who select the plays are white therefore personal idiosyncrasies enter into the problem and they keep the negro actor from the stage the basic motive is simply resentment towards miscegenation on the american stage in general and the university stage in particular america doesnt want the negro actor to be a man on its stage and since the basic themes of american plays revolve around sex the negro actors situation is tragic the student obtains nothing at all how can he when the actedout play on stage before an audience is the basic dynamics of such a study the true understanding of acting comes when the student is involved in acting and producing before a live audience and the professors destroy this by selecting classics which the negro actor finds difficulty in acting not to mention the difficulty of casting i cant use you in this one mr its a swedish or russian norwegian french etc play the majority of negro actors who seek training in university theatre have traces of the southern dialect if they have not assimilated and the way american education is today one cannot have any traces of the south in speech it is an awful but true fact what then if the student actor is cast because of necessity in three sisters enemy of the people antigone st joan major barbara can he be convincing in such a dated repertory that was written when he did not figure into the scheme of things a drama department must seek truths in theatrical works many professors keep these truths in mind when casting and very often avoid the negro actor the negro actor cannot bring truth as whites see it to the classics however a university willif the national association for the advancement of colored people complainspresent emperor jones or othello and maybe the merchant of venice after consulting the local synagogue but a negro actor cannot look forward to playing a lead character in a university theatre production after graduating he knows nothing about acting before an audience item i compared the average ratio of plays a negro actor appeared in per season to the average number a white actor appeared in per season at wayne state university in detroit also compared the total number of plays of negro graduates against white graduates the ratio was to drama school the only place to obtain acting experience is the drama school the negro actor either goes to a theatre magazine or obtains information from a friend in the theatre both stressing how great the instructor is at teaching mr stanislavskis method the actor finds his past acting experience brushed aside by the teacher he is immediately tossed into a beginners class if he is above average better than every white actor in the class he will work with some name professionals if not he will work with a teacher who has no knowledge at all about the negro and very little about acting the teachers know that established names are impressive to the new actor he will occasionally mention the times he worked with jesse bonstelle petier garrick fiske modjeska brando or beaumont and fletcher not necessarily in this order yet the drama schools with all their faults are the only places where a negro actor can sharpen his craft this of course is because he actually works on a stage with others before a live audience now after a long and arduous journey the young negro aspirant becomes a professional actor some use the achievements of the past to guide their future i said earlier i would get back to this now it is alright to be of the present no one would knock this but when a performer knows absolutely nothing of the history of his profession how can he possibly understand the present the most proficient actors in the businessjames earl jones robert hooks a freeman jr diana sands cliff frazier brock peters ivan dixon abby lincoln gloria foster clarence williams iii roscoe lee browne know the past present and have ideas of some of the future problems they will encounter the photos by carl van vechten and vandamm of the late charles gilpin rose mcclendon canada lee frank wilson jack carter edna thomas abbie mitchell and freda washington are the perfect examples of the glory of the past they were the actors who brought forth to america the famous allnegro productions of macbeth porgy haiti and other exciting plays via the federal theater project it grew out of harlem and it remains to this day an important contribution to the american stage i think it is because those actors had a purpose so many of todays actors lack purpose and direction how can one grasp for something when there is nothing to grasp shout in rage if not really angry and too one cannot communicate and assimilate at the same time item in the midst of the present racial struggle in this country our stage ignores it it treats it as if it doesnt exist negro playwright the negro actors situation can be bettered by joining with negro writers and building an audience within the negro community i think this has been done with great results in detroit at the concepteast theater and in harlem with leroi jones black arts theater both actor and playwright must be willing to experiment with new forms within their respective crafts if this is done the small churches and corner storefronts will be filled with willing ears and it can be done since there is no one to answer to but each other it worked in harlem with the american negro theater they produced phillip yordans anna lucasta with great results it produced worthy plays by negro writers abram hills on strivers row and early plays by young ossie davis and years later mr davis hit broadway with his romping comedy purlie victorious now ossie davis is an experienced writer not one of the typical library writers clifford odets but one who has the background in acting and directing within a negro community and if we do not know yet that a play about negroes must appeal to negroes we should leave the theatre i do not mean they must love or hate it but they must identify with it the playwright must seize new ideas and techniques if the negro actor is to again be of any importance he must disregard the argument he received in collegean argument for a standardization which is paradoxically strangling the actors contribution item the plays of the early abby theatre in dublin were not considered excellent unless they caused a riot the theatre as it is today without controversy and excitement save leroi jones is dead theatre it is a place to go and digest dinner the negro playwright should write about what he understands all around him he can see what happens when white writers pen negro struggle situations they all fail due to a lack of understanding the subject as a negro playwright tells it explaining to james baldwin how ketti fring came to adapt richard wrights long dream she was sitting by this swimming pool dig and reading this book and she thought this would make a perfectly darling play so she wrote the first few scenes and called out her butler chauffeur and maid and read the first few scenes to them and asked now isnt this the way you poor downtrodden colored people feel about things why yes miss fring they answered after considering which is better keeping miss fring happy or disliking the play italics mine and i thought so says the playwright and on we go and on and on all the critics felt approximately the same about it after it opened on broadway here in part is one example from john chapman i did depart after the first act of this one and reported to my newspaper that this act of the long dream was shoddy and lasciviousa degradation of my seat companion and of several admirable negro actors it seemed impossible that this play could have been adapted by the lady who did such a beautiful job of adapting thomas wolfes look homeward angel of course the better things about the play were omitted by mr chapman the brilliant direction by lloyd richards and the two excellent performances by a freeman and lawrence winters the same thing happened when baldwin wrote blues for mr charlie all his white characters were badly drawn and many thought this would have been impossible for baldwin to do since it is he who stresses always that negroes know more about whites than whites know of themselves negroes have been taking care of their children and kitchens for over years i also think that more negro novelists should write for the theatre if the long dream the cool world mandingo etc then it should be john o killens ronald fair william melvin kelley chester himes or some negro writer doing the adapting and even though baldwin failed with his white characters his negro characters were so real and vivid that one is held spellbound by them let me say this in conclusion if the negro actor can impose his own values upon the american stage namely his past present and possible future he can join with white america in controlling it theatre of reality by ed bullins the contemporary american theater many times the black playwright finds himself in opposition to the black actor principally when the actor manifests attitudes and behavior that the writer is engaged in altering there are considerations that a novelist does not concern himself with but that a playwright is compelled to if the playwright is realistic and sincere about having his work produced the essential and most arbitrary element is humans the producer the director the actors the hypothetical audience and sadly the critic a generality that can be made is that the producer of stageplays is concerned with making money in america there are the becks of the living theater in new york which the police shut down they are currently touring in europe because america resisted their dedication to pure and noncommercial theater the becks believe that producing plays which advance or keep vital dramatic art is a duty they are so antitraditional as to have staged ezra pounds adaptation of classic japanese noh theatre and in contemporary spirit presenting kenneth browns the brig a dramatic experience which resists labeling not being quite a play nor an antiplay the becks present production frankenstein which opened in europe is experimental which stretches understatement to its limits but it may be the boldest attempt at staging antonin artauds ideas for a theater of cruelty to date the becks living theater is as diverse as art and there are too few young dynamic people today like peter rachtman of the west coast rachtman is one of the group that brought leroi jones powerful dutchman and the toilet to los angeles and san francisco and though profitoriented rachtman is not discouraged from staging productions of quality though they be against the status quo and not meek and quite white american if they are good box office this is only to say that quality sells as does trash ideally lowkeyed quality plays can be produced successfully as can more sensational ones in good or poor taste and this also implies that plays by or about negroes have to be neither sensational controversial nor banal cinema has broken this ground with films such as lilies of the field and nothing but a man but whatever the play it should be honest if honesty is controversial then that is the truth of drama so it is for the black playwright to do the best he can at his job of writing and presenting his vision and not become prematurely emasculated by the prospect of not being produced only because of his race and the themes which come naturally from his cultural experience a black playwright must find his producer as one of any color must and as the black novelist has to seek out a publisher though the playwright may discover he has special handicaps in getting produced for one unlike the widening shelves of negro novels there have been only a small number of successfully produced negro plays that is plays by negroes concerning negro characterization and created for the general audience not that special almost exclusively white audience which patronizes negro drama for obscure exotic reasons there is hardly any precedent of success by which the negro playwright can win his producer and the producer being commonly white has the colorbarrier as an intensifier of his suspicions that he is gambling on something into which he has minute insight he worries that he can sell black novelty and innovation to a newly created audience if there were any major black producers this factor might be reduced but the situation appears to remain as it has been the most relevant item in the playwrightproducer relationship is cost it may cost a producer times more than a publisher to back black talent and businessmens ledgers are especially sensitive to two stains red and black ink if there is a common prayer universally murmured by playwrights one of its petitions is that their work get adequate direction adequate direction is usually more than the compulsiondriven play wright believes probable and he feels inspired direction is entirely within the dimensions of miracle when the playwright laments his past productions the director is likely to be given a large share of the abuse and the remainder goes to the aggregate components of the disaster of course some playwrights can capably direct their own works but this is rare different aesthetic physics are at work in writing a play and manipulating the many elements that go into a staged play and the writer is ordinarily too close to his baby to have the scope and objectivity needed to raise the work from the page and from within his imagination so that it may be communicated completely to the audience happily for the novelist he is the lord of the small universe he creates and his fictional souls shuffle along in time to his whims and no others the negro playwright has a special problem in finding better than average direction outside of the new york theater area there is an absence of capable black directors and within new york the same statement possibly holds true why would a negro playwright prefer a negro director it could be assumed by the writer that a director with like cultural experiences could better interpret the nuances and shading of meanings in the work identifying somewhat with the characters situations and with the theme if the reverse is true if the playwright prefers any excellent direction to that of the average then it is a problem that belongs to every playwright to have his work interpreted skillfully and when the playwright understands that the best direction is beyond the simple limits of interpretation then the directors art and understanding of theater techniques can begin working much to the benefit of the total production the total production stands very nearly upon the performances of the actors even shakespeare has taken many a pratfall behind the ineptness of actors for the playwright of color finding qualified negro actors for his cast is difficult though there are numerous available bodies ready to stand before the lights and expose their teeth and overblown egos of all his problems the negro playwrights greatest is the young trained actor and actress of his same race not the lack of trained people this training does not necessarily qualify these actors for many roles the black playwright has in mind if a negro playwright is to write effectively and honestly he must draw upon his experience all negroes do not come from the ghetto naturally but if the situations the playwright creates upon stage have characters he knows to have basis in truth ordinarily these are black characters it is very difficult for many negro actors and actresses to identify with negro characters from the masses though they do well representing extremely middle class negroes the same may hold true for young white actors at auditions the black playwright might observe a black actress mouthing her lines like a white telephone operator or bouncing through a scene set in the black ghetto of south philadelphia as if she were doris day aping the american version of the blueeyed girl next door some male negro actors appear horrified when asked to speak like sonny liston and seem offended and say that they can not talk that way and will not even say those words they mince out the exits leaving behind remarks like i thought an actor was needed sadly the black playwright did not have it in him that day to create the modern american othello or cleopatra he merely wrote from what he knew so his contemporary play was left in need of just black actors ones who were not afraid to act as black human beings a playwrights major problem as opposed to a novelists is that each of his characters must be what he is they all must stand tall this must be brought out by the convincing performances of the actors to be what the character is then the actor must portray the character in an honest and natural manner but today it would not seem unlikely that a director would come before a negro actor newly graduated from an american school of acting and spend hours with him saying now remember in this part you are a negro you are black and the pity is that the actor would really have to sweat to get into his role he would have to work diligently convincing himself that he was indeed negro often a characterization falls the actor the director or the playwright fails collapsing the structure of the plays reality about their ears a novelist has more range to ramble in than his characters believability or their situations he can even chat philosophize and wisecrack with his readers characters in drama are resented by the audience for their not sticking to the point maintaining the honesty of their motivations with the negro playwright it is the negro actor who dramatizes the vital characters and the actor must breath the truth of his own conviction in that character for his portrayal to be perfect but not all the blame rests with the black actor or his schooling there are interracial and a few entirely negro theater groups training black actors to do little other than the greek classics shakespeare chekhov and shaw casting negroes indiscriminately in every conceivable role a sort of white characterization done in authentic black face true the experience for the actor is invaluable and should be a part of his training but a hidden evil exists in the continuation or the strict adherence to this brand of liberality it is a selfdefeating device for the actor the black actor is unintentionally made to say in essence that he can act too he a black man can do the classic repertoire of the continent as can a white actor that he can act and not only be stereotyped in butler roles set in the ante bellum south well it should be known that he can act especially by the actor one of his number has won an oscar and others appear on nationwide tv though it is questionable whether these are any criteria of adequate professional standards incidentally these black actors play negroes not creon following the above type of reasoning is tantamount to the black authors wasting years telling his waiting readers that he can write that he is concerned with the art of writing and nothing else but getting almost no writing completed and in print aside from his infrequent artistic manifestos sent out to indicate that he is still breathing the fight by the black actor to prove that he can act is as much over as the black writers fight to prove that he can write and both should get to work at their crafts and be aware that aristotle and his aesthetic dogmas are not of this time and never had been meant for the black artist anyway there are new roles new themes and new definitions being created and explored now and the black actor and writer should become aware in approaching one of the artistic black theater groups the negro playwrights scripts may be taken and returned shortly and the playwright told that his work is too experimental or obscene if it uses too much of the negro idiom of the ghetto the groups premise might be that when negroes of flesh and blood are depicted on the stage that this is verging upon revolution and is too drastic it is far beyond the groups range of belief and comprehension they can not become familiar with a real negro on the stage or the playwright may be told that they do not bother with original scripts that they do the classics or the work of proven negro writers like langston hughes that is the negro writers who have made it somewhat with the white press and then are considered minor celebrities by the black bourgeoisie then the artsy craftsy colored folk accept them as their own when asked why they do not produce young black playwrights the answer almost invariably is there are none are there of course there are none to their knowledge because of their refusal to look for or acknowledge any until the white critics deem it correct for them to with this situation existing entering little theater for the black playwright is more than likely not an asset to his career but a handicap for he will seldom find other than the conventional timid and intellectually lazy and backward bourgeois black masquerading as an artist the theater of reality should be mentioned now when speaking of the audience and the critic the revolutionary nature of this theater is not of style and technique but of theme and character any theatrical style or method can be used separately or in combinations to reach the truth of the play in this manner the play could begin naturalistically with a character in a realistic setting and progress through expressionism surrealism absurdity and back to realism dramatizing the journey of the character through his own pysche to reach his loss of innocence selfawareness or illumination to reach what individually is called reality the method is not the goal in this theater the result must elicit the single response of yes so it is not a call for a return to realism or naturalism that this theater calls for it is the exposure of illusion through exploding myths and lies that are disguised as reality and truths these myths and especially those concerning the black man clutter the heart of his existence his humanity nor is this theater a plea for his humanity time will not be wasted in silly issues this theater is not exclusively about negroes nor for negroes its trend should only go counter to that force in western society which dehumanizes enslaves and defeats man at his best whether this force originates in mans institutions or his bewildered psyche that has built a defense and powerstructure that can not be much longer contained this theater in this century may be viewed as against society the american society in particular by white critics it will undoubtedly be misnomered protest literature and yes it will certainly expose some of the wrongs of the society for this theater is against the hypocritical cant and morality of this sick society and demonstrates how sick the society is by exposing her sores her warped humans if this is social realism or protest then let it speak reality for all people not only a temporarily deprived selfish middleclass today the bulk of the theater going audience is white one problem for the negro playwright is that part of the audience will resist the reality of his characters they will refuse to identify with black characters in any way even the middleclass negro members of the audience will fight the characters if they come from the submerged elements of the culture the characters of the new reality will be fought whether they are upon a stage or found in a book and most of the inaccurate criticism of negro works have had this kind of bias at its roots the white critic is deceived by himself and his colleagues and the university departments of literature always years behind perpetuate and sustain these myths one great boring myth is that black writers are collectively engaged in writing protest literature and can or will do little else these same people should get hip to chester himes a talent of major proportions who has been around before a lot of them this lie of protest has circulated so widely and convincingly that it has damaged most contemporary negro writers as passed over earlier it may have destroyed the most talented black writer of today but perhaps the times will rescue him for his art and it is hokum lately two of the most authentic works of black protest literature have been the book black like me and the documentary play in white america and both have been authored by white men but small knowledged english professors across the country if they mention it at all without having seen the production or having read the script are branding leroi jones play the toilet a protest play when it is simply a love story done in a melodramatic naturalistic vein the writer can not worry about the audience he knows there is a small hardcore audience for him and they will discover one another and luckily the audience will grow to universal proportions and the writer knows that there is only one critic himself all that a reviewer or a critic can do positively for a writer is to get him more audience appeal or get him more readers if the critic fails to achieve this then the writer should dismiss him the black writer knows that the critics are white and they are most certain not to understand his work or get its finer points especially when the writer is not slanting his work to a middleclass white audience and he is setting his own limitations and not relying upon the critics judgments honesty is what the writer should be after the theater of reality is an attempt to return to mans honesty to himself to his fellows and in his vision it is indeed a theater of metaphysical yearnings the playwright does this job by uncovering the reality of his art his humanity his existence as an intelligent and moral entity in the universe and makes the entire universe an audience of this transformation of the psyche and spirit this new revolution is of the mind and spirit and the revolution seems to have begun and if it has there are many facets to it there are the doers there are the theorists and there are the chroniclers and story tellers each is working from within a framework of reality which can always be expanded illuminated and hopefully passed on festival time in iluhur the festival t is a grandiose idea andas such ideas are likely to be characterized by a certain dreaminess but that is not necessarily a fault without great dreams many little miracles would not be possible the chief dreamer is leopold sedar senghor the poetpresident of senegal like most serious african leaders president senghor is concerned with africas achievement of genuine power and consequence in the world and he feels that the edifice of african power and consequence must be built on a base of cultural security the historical significance of the first world festival of negro arts flows from two facts president senghor told the senegalese people the first is that the festival will be held in dakar in senegal in other words in africa the birthplace of the negro peopleof homo sapiens himself even where it will mean something more than a return to original sources it will be a case of man sinking his roots into mother earth the second fact is that the stage of defending negritude has passed and that the festival will serve rather to illustrate it and as an illustration and no longer a theoretical exposition it will constitute a definite action a positive contribution to the construction of a civilization based on universal values in a word we will have ceased once and for all to be cultural consumers and will at long last ourselves become cultural producers such then is the significance of this event which will mark the advent of a new era for us the era of cultural independence i say independence and not autarchyfar from it because the works to be assembled and displayed here will almost invariably have been enriched by foreign contributions and it is well that this should be so since the problem for negritude in this twentieth century of ours is to participate in the convergence of all mankindnot exactly in this atomic century by contributing new techniques but by contributing a new style a soul the same which quickened the pulse of homo sapiens when the sun of reason rose above the horizon it is the language of poetry the actual planning of the first world festival of negro arts was entrusted to a local committee at dakar and to the governments of the dozens of countries in africa and the americas which indicated interest in participating in the festival the festivals aims were generally outlined as follows to permit negro artists throughout the world to return periodically to the sources of their art to make known the contributions of negritude a negros pride in his race and a recognition of the innessbrown of new york city john a davis president of the american society of african culture is the committees vice president marian anderson is vicechairman of the committees board of directors and mrs lyndon b johnson wife of the president of the united states is honorary negros unique creative ability based on his african heritage to make it possible for negro artists to meet and demonstrate their talents to members of the international art world to advance international and interracial understanding the american committee for the festival is headed by mrs virginia chairman of the committee in many ways the american participants in the festival will strikingly illustrate the concept of negritude the african origin the pride of race and the amalgamation of cultures prominent among these participants will be miss anderson duke ellington and his orchestra baritone william warfield soprano martina arroyo

city dakar is a city of some people a portcity on the atlantic which also is an important terminal for flights between europe and south america it is an old colonial center but it is a very new cityit is in fact two cities the principal city is a glittering aggregation of modern government buildings apartments and villas with broad boulevards and cozy parks the other city is a conglomeration of shackssome of them all but incredible and pungent market places and medinas straight out of the ancient past the main city is frenchflavored and mostly frenchoccupied there are some europeans in dakaror there were that many until the recent decision from paris cutting back on military outposts in senegal and other african countries closely associated with the french government the europeans reside in most of the beautiful villas and plush apartment buildings on the plateau the cosmopolitan heart of the city but not because there is racial segregation there emphatically is not only a few africans can afford to live in such luxury also the better shops along the avenues william ponty and maginot and bordering independence square are owned by the french and those not owned by the french are in the hands of lebanese and greek traders the other city is predominantly african its borders are not geographical for africans live throughout the city even on the plateau the french colonialists being less racist than the british did not disdain the africans in whose midst they found themselves and so they built their villas next door to the african huts the african city is principally distinguished by the style and quality of its housing the better of these old residences are low rambling structures walledin from the street and set around a courtyard the worst of them are wood and cardboard leantos but there are the medinas the native quarters which stretch for miles depressingly toward the developing suburbs but all in the african city is not depressingfar from it some of the new housing developments beyond the medinas are handsomer than any similar residences negroes occupy in america they were designed for middleincome people and there are individual villas replete with gardens and garages as well as blocks of apartments there also are shopping centers usually with new movie theatres with one key exceptionthe ministry of financethe government of senegal is in the hands of africans and it is africans one sees relaxing against the burgundy upholstery of the huge citroen limousines the cadillacs of france gliding through the streets but africans are all but absent in significant industry and business in the sprawling markets the african stalls are the poorest and least attractive and africans are present in the offices of the utilities and the professional services primarily as clerks there are more than hotels in dakar a few of them ngor croix du sud very good a few of them fair vichy hotel de la paix atlantic plateau but most of them quite small and ordinary there are many restaurants some of them excellent and nearly all of them french the exceptions are the vietnamese and lebanese restaurants there are no africanowned restaurants in dakar that americans would want to patronize one of the liveliest nightclubs is africanownedthe nianey it is located on la corniche the seaside drive and it is as wellappointed as any of the others discotheques are popular and there are several to choose from the music is as familiar in dakar as it is in atlanta and the dancing is not very different there are several sidewalk cafes a large number of movie theatres super markets and shops selling everything from mink coats to razor blades some of the most interesting shops for being exotic are owned by the lebanese and greeks and they feature items of clothing and utility which appeal to the religious faith of the african populace that faith is islamic an estimated per cent of the senegalese are moslems the great mosque is a structure of imposing stature and considerable beauty there are several dozen lesser mosques scattered throughout the city and an astonishingly elegant mosque at touba some kilometers from dakar the people the dominant raceor tribe in dakar as in all senegal is wolof other races are peul serere tukulor diola and malinke the wolofs are prominent in government education and in the arts the senegalese have been in the vanguard for generations for they were favored by the french administrators during colonialism as teachers and subofficials throughout the vast french west african empire the large number of french people in dakar is a consequence of the citys choice as governmental industrial and educational center during colonialism thousands of frenchmen pulled up roots in france and settled in dakar and many of those still living there were born there they no longer control the actual machinery of government but the industry remains solidly in their hands and while an increasing number of africans are assuming key jobs in education top posts in the university and the secondary schools are held by frenchmen and other europeans the president of the rapidly growing university of dakar is french for example next to the french the major merchants in dakar are the lebanese and greeks they are traders by tradition and whole blocks in the center of the city are lined with their shops one little different from the other all selling the brilliant cloth and arab robes so popular with the africans the near easterners like the french have little to do with the actual business of running the government a colorful minority in dakar are the moors the angular handsome nomads from mauritania who reap considerable wealth through the establishment of small stores in the african areas there are few moorish women among them apparently the moors come down on foot from mauritania in teams of three or four spend a period of three or four months minding the stores which remain open virtually around the clock then return to their families while others take over the commercial chores they live very simply spending money only on food their simple blueandwhite or blackandwhite robes and on sandals they socialize with none of the other groups another minority in dakar are the portuguese an artificial race of portuguese and african ancestry they hold themselves somewhat aloof from the ordinary africans and yet they lack the status of the educated africans they are clerks barbers and minor functionaries festival facilities at the cost of some the government renovated and enlarged yoff airport perhaps the busiest air terminal south of the sahara a new classiclined museum was especially built to house the countrys impressive collection of african art and artifacts the collection of art and sculpture which has been assembled from all over the world for the festival also will be exhibited there the daniel sorano theatre one of the most modern and most comfortable theatres in the world was built for the festival most of the performances will be presented there before a select audience the theatre seats only amity stadium which will accommodate some persons also was built for the festival all performances held at the daniel sorano theatre also will be held in the stadium so that the general public can attend another minority in dakar are the portuguese an artificial race of portuguese and african ancestry they hold themselves somewhat aloof from the ordinary africans and yet they lack the status of the educated africans they are clerks barbers and minor functionaries goree island one of the historic sites of africa will be the scene of a nightly sound and light spectacle during the festival the island served as a staging area for many of the hundreds of thousands of africans who were sent into bondage during slavery it also was inhabited by the dutch english and french during different eras and served as a fort for france during the two world wars on one end of the island the elaborate underground tunnels and fortifications reminiscent of the maginot line remain pretty much as they were originally the united states gift to the senegalese government for the festival is a handsome motor launch which will transport visitors from the dakar docks out to goree island the trip takes about minutes festival footnotes while christians represent only about six per cent of the dakarois population there are several remarkably handsome catholic churches in the citv and the cathedral of dakar which occupies a site at the very center of the plateau section is an impressive edifice some of the choral music performances will be presented at the cathedral the brilliant costumes of the african womenlavenders and crimsons and chartreuses are favoriteswill startle many american negroes but the sight should prove once and for always that bright colors definitely do compliment dark skins black american women traditionally have shied away from brilliant colors for much the same reason that many negroes refuse to eat watermelon but the sarilike costumes in senegal might begin to change all that the artisan village a little compound where ceramists goldsmiths and silversmiths weavers and sculptors work display and sell their products has been upgraded and modernized for the festival visitors will find unfortunately that prices also have been upgraded and modernized the best buys here probably will be gold and silver jewelry as other items may be bought more reasonably by haggling with peddlers along avenue william ponty or on the streets of the city haggling over price incidentally is a tradition in africa the buyer who pays the first price asked by the seller will be taken africans expect to argue and bargain and they are skillful at it however for the american unaccustomed to such practices the danger is that inflated prices will be paid for items the sight of men walking along the streets holding hands might startle some americans but it shouldnt it means only that they are moslems and friends and not as the late richard wright naively assumedthat they are sexual or homosexual partners there are some lepers in senegal and some of them will appear as beggars on the streets of dakar visitors to the festival must expect to be regularly accosted by beggars as well as by platoons of peddlers many handicapped africans are trained to beg for a living and the practice is encouraged by the concept of charity in the islamic faith only those with very strong stomachs and insatiable curiosity are advised to brave the bowels of the great central market but for those the experience will be worth it it is fascinating for example to watch the women hack and approtion the huge fish sold in the markets lower depths the french in dakar will be hostile at worst and will feign monumental indifference at best they should be ignored however festival visitors should insist on courtesy and service as they certainly will be paying for it a dollar is worth francs frenchafrican community francs not the kind from france on the books but the local bank exchange is about francs for a dollar travelers check and for a dollar bill that does not include the one per cent charge for making the exchange all visitors to the festival should have visas preferably obtained before entering the country however president senghor has given assurances that visas will be available at the dakar airport for those arriving without them there is a charge visitors also should have roundtrip or intransit tickets indicating that they will travel on from senegal after the festival apart from taking the usual smallpox and yellow fever and cholera and typhus shots visitors to senegal should take along dependable antimalaria pills taxis are plentiful in dakar and they have meters visitors should not pay more than is indicated on the meterexcept late at night when the meter tab is doubled as a sort of service tax tipping in senegal is not done according to americanor even europeancustom a five per cent tip is considered adequate there are several excellent beaches at dakarat the hotel ngor below the coastal drive near the residence of the american ambassador mercer cook sr and below the park along boulevard roosevelt there also is an excellent beach at goree island restaurants are located nearby and save a round for jamie brown by anita r cornwell e stood in front of the bara tall thin forlorn figure in soiled khakisfingering the c hange jn his pockets he was new in town having just hopped off an interstate tractor trailer some thirty minutes ago and he knew he should be looking for some place to sleep but the one dollar and fortyseven cents clutched in his bony hand did not provide the needed encouragement a brisk september breeze swept down the avenue banging against his hunched shoulders and he looked around wondering if hed ever see a friendly face again then from inside the bar he heard the jukebox hammering out a down home blues which set the wheels of memory spinning in his aching head he jerked his hands from his pockets and slowly pushed through the battered door the music was still loud and going good as he slid onto a corner stool and plunked his quarter down so thered be no question concerning his ability to pay he ordered a glass of beer then pulled out a crumpled pack of stale cigarettes the record ended and soon he was aware of one man pulling away from the small group at the other end of the bar and apparently headed in his direction the stranger gingerly holding a bottle of beer in one hand and a long thin cigar in the other wore a wide brim beige felt hat which set firmly on his head as though welded there and a yellow silk tee shirt which stretched endlessly across his bulky chest and disappeared down into black gabardine slacks tightly gathered at waist and ankles his tan narrowtoed shoes made quick tapping sounds on the hard barroom floor and any moment jamie fully expected the fellow to stick the cigar between his teeth yank the hat from his head and break into the old soft shoe routine as he neared jamies stool his leathery face broke in a gaptoothed grin and jamie not quite knowing what else to do lifted his glass and drained it surprisingly enough jamie brown jr the perennial country boy and harry lem yonkers onetime country boy now turned city slicker hit it off rather well i was born in south carolina lem told jamie after they had moved over to a booth but once i lit outta them woods i never looked back he gave a significant pause then you from down that way too i bet jamie nodded he was born in georgia in the midst of the depression but hed been travelling since he was old enough to hop a moving freight i been in charlotte a while he said carefully lem was silent as he lit a fresh stogie then taking a long pull from his beer he ran one finger across the small neat mustache which hugged his lip like a pencil mark the law after you jamie shook his head woman trouble he said grudgingly then began fishing around for another cigarette lem grinned i guess you busted he said finally jamie nodded his brooding eyes staring at his beer glass he hadnt allowed himself to wonder why lem was being so friendly so if it was a little game in the back room he was after he could move on now however lem only leaned back against the booth his odd catlike eyes examining the ceiling while his mind seemed busy with some far off activity i got a room up on the avenue he began slowly and if you aint quite prepared to put up at the bellevue maybe youd like to try your luck there till you git straightened out jamies stomach muscles tightened if there was one thing he was sick of it was sharing other peoples rooms in charlotte when he wasnt with his girl he had his cousins two small but overactive boys in the bed next to his and back home hed slept on a pallet under the kitchen table even now he could feel that hard floor trembling as an outraged march wind tore at the corners of that crumbling shack he looked over at lem almost ready to refuse the offer but the agile lem jumped ahead of him of course he began amiably if you have other plans now dont let me interfere and jamie of course had no plans there were dreams but nothing that included an immediate roof over his head so finally he accepted lems invitation and decided to worry about motives later lems room up around nd street was fairly comfortable and surprisingly clean the bed looked terribly tempting to jamie who had been sleeping on everything but a bed for the past several weeks lem explained that the landlady took care of everything just leave your clothes in the bathroom he said to the boneweary jamie miss mamiell tend to em late next morning while jamie dressed in his freshly laundered clothing lem slumped down into the lone comfortable chair propped his narrowtoed shoes up on the outdated coffee table and began sounding jamie out whereupon jamie promptly announced his intentions of finding gainful employment lem nearly swallowed his stogie man you crazy or something that eight to five crap is for squares you one of th little people and black to boot you aint ever gonna git nowhere nohow so you may as well live while you standing still in your own little rut turning his back on lem jamie grunted his hands deep in his pockets his eyes raking the avenue his mind a thousand miles away on caro the girl who had twotimed him in charlotte finally he looked back at lem who was still on the same old tune the way i figure it lem was saying rather smugly a mans gotta use his head to git along in this old world now me i can git a little lucky at times so i get picked up now and then so what he demanded waving a languid hand there aint hardly any more bugs in the cooler than here and i dont hafta worry bout the rent or the women hounding my door his eye caught jamies man them broads can be a pain cant they they give you a quarter and think they own you one of them big loud ones got her wine head tore up one night and come barging in here like hurricane hattie and liken to kilt a little chick id just met at the timbers he sighed heavily remembering the atrocious incident and i guess you know what miss mamie said after that no more entertaining in the room meaning no more broads naturally a faint smile crossed jamies lips as he pictured the fat broad giving lems chick hell now he knew why lem didnt mind him staying here but he wanted no part of lems copdodging schemes so early next morning armed with several want ads from the sunday paper which hed found stuffed under the bath tub he made his way downtown and many hours later a rejoicing jamie had a job as an elevator operator he could hardly wait to see lems face when he told him the news man youre kidding lem said quickly and jamie mistaking lems reaction for disbelief over his great good fortune went on to relate even the minute details which led to his find when jamie finished lem held his head in mock despair and here i spend half the day lining up something good for you he groaned man the setup is waiting an open book you can make more in one day with that territory ikes got for you than youd make in a whole year hiking some elevator up and down jamie clammed up his wounded sheep dogs eyes avoided lem who immediately realized his approach had lacked finesse tell you what he said springing up out of the chair and giving jamie a smile which displayed his gap and most of his gold fillings ill get ike to hold the book whilst you think about it he sighed his eyes rolling up to the ceiling its sure a sweet setup though i would take it myself but them bluecoated bastards are on my tail right now i cant even look crosseyed less they right there smelling around and you cant pay off nobody hardly any more he lamented turning to stare out at his beloved avenue jamie shrugged but did not vocally reject the proposal if lem wanted to believe he was stupid enough to get mixed up with the numbers racket he would go right along letting him think it but he was ready to settle down and he knew if he had a steady job and kept his eyes open sooner or later hed find the right girl to settle down with him and that girl stepped into his elevator one rainy morning in midoctober without even bothering to nod at him he was old on the job now and in his lanky countryboy fashion had even acquired a bit of polish being tall and slender with the flat hips and wide sweeping shoulders of a flashing halfback his uniform hung well on him he got along with the other operators did his job well and banked what little he could after paying the rent and lending lem five here and there his account was slow shaping up but he really didnt mind the money spent on lem for in addition to his generous nature he was well aware that whatever lems motives he had done him a great favor by taking him in when he was down to his last dollar and despite lems constant ribbing jamie was grateful for his companionship for he found the ways of the city baffling indeed though constantly surrounded by people he had never been lonelier in his entire life his coworkers were friendly but they were not his friends and those faceless bodies who poured into his car day after day really didnt know him from a crack in the wall then at five oclock sharp the whole horde fled from the building as if it were enveloped in flames then retha hodges glided into his elevator breaking the shackles from his haunted heart yet already he was her willing slave had she but known it at lunch time he caught sight of her again briefly for she took the late lunch when the crowd reached its peak and was soon swallowed up he glared at the hungry mob surging past him and for one awful moment his vexation was such that he thought of taking the whole load to the basement and leaving them to find their way up the best they could at five oclock he missed her completely and was so shaken that he actually toyed with the idea of asking ben their starter about her but by the time he was free ben had vanished as had practically every other soul in the huge building when he finally pushed through the revolving doors dusk had firmly set in and mumbling to himself he slowly made his way to the corner where he waited for the light to change banging his fists one against the other he stared up at the darkened tower of city hall where a host of unseen starlings chattered madly like women at a bridge party then glared at the long succession of jersey buses inching around the corner spitefully blocking his way unaware that he was not going anywhere anyway as lem was only too willing to point out he was standing still in his own little rut damn lem damn him to hell he muttered startling several pedestrians standing near him then he whirled and blindly walked in the opposite direction si v in no time at all she was smiling at him and he had even managed to learn her name but then he made no further progress whatsoever and daily he grew more desperate he simply had to make her aware of him as a person not as just another operator yet the more he pondered the situation the more insoluble it seemed then against his better judgment he sought advice from lem man youd better let that chick alone said lem standing flatfooted in yellow striped socks and flowered undershorts dont you know them whitecollar broads are the worse skirts under th sun theyre looking for some square wholl set em up in the suburbs like theyre queen of th may he yanked the stogie from his mouth forget that broad man and come on down to th timbers with me where you can get your kicks without paying with your own blood jamie already in bed snorted furiously what make you think you know so damn much you always talking outta both sides of your mouth but you aint got no more than i got lem cackled as he strutted over to the bed man i told you before aint none of us got nothing and we aint ever going to git nothing so why dont you stop whining that broad you lusting after aint thinking bout you her folks done sent her to college and they expects her to marry somebody with more education than she got i bet you anything if she aint already got her eye on some lawyer or some teacher she got some joker stashed away in medical school man her folks aint gonna have nobody like you messin round anybody like her jamie swung with the pillow then but lem ducked away laughing fiendishly and scooted up the hall to the bathroom the next day was rainy and dreary and jamies spirits were exceedingly low for somehow that morning he had missed seeing retha around ten he took his break and skitted through the damp mist down to the corner cafeteria he had not had breakfast and briefly as he moved through the line he considered buying bacon and eggs but his stomach rebelled so he settled for two cups of coffee then as he sauntered away from the cashier he thought how nice if one of the cups were for retha so vivid then was the image of her in his mind that when he actually saw her sitting alone he thought surely he was still daydreaming then she smiled and motioned for him to sit with her and his heart took wings despite the horrid clammy weather she sparkled like a newly minted coin and he heard lems sarcastic warning ringing in his ears her folks dont want nobody like you messin round anybody like her but he quickly forgot lem in his desperate effort to find something fetching to say to her almost in the next moment it seemed she had to leave he stood also confused and bedazzled on the verge of leaving with her no please stay and finish your coffee she requested with such delightful charm that he fairly blossomed she laughed then a pure clear sound which fell upon his ears like distant church chimes and then to his utter astonishment he heard her saying that perhaps they would meet again tomorrow at break time jamie left the building the following morning staring down at his feet bleakly wondering if they carried him on still another of his fools errands pushing through the revolving doors he ran down the steps that led into the restaurant he saw her at once sitting at the same table joy transformed his face and for the moment his shyness left him i missed you this morning he said i thought maybe you didnt come in i came early she said the work has piled up tremendously then she nodded toward the counter dont you want coffee today he moved his chair closer his eyes devouring her face naw i dont drink it much he answered not really concentrating on what he was saying i hadnt et breakfast yesterday a faint flush stained her cheeks and instantly he was conscious of his speech people like her didnt use words like et and he didnt usually any more in charlotte before he met caro he had gone to night school for two years but maybe hed better hunt around for something to brush up again he couldnt have his girl blushing at his bad language retha gave him a dazzling smile but his selfdoubts had tied his tongue now then in one of the most exquisite gestures hed ever seen she lifted her hand and touched his own as it quivered near the sugar container i have to leave now jamie were terribly rushed just now but tomorrow perhaps her dark eyes slipped into his and he felt her hand warm and soft and burning him to his very soul and he was so filled with love for her he could have wept thereafter morning coffee became a habit with them and soon they were lunching together his shyness with her all but vanished as he gained more knowledge of her life away from the building but in spite of all the moments spent together at break and luncheon after work ended retha hodges was still as lost to him as the moon for a while he convinced himself that this was only a temporary situation and spent his evenings exploring the city sometimes even venturing into one of the movie houses on chestnut street but it was no good in the movies alone when your girl is god only knows where so he decided to spend his free time on another selfimprovement kick wandering into learys one evening he came across a used english textbook but not until he noted the gleam in lems eyes did he realize his error in bringing the book home for up until that very moment he had given lem the impression that the girl on the job no longer interested him lem swooped the book up from its wrappings and waved it high above his head man what you doing with this junk english essentials you gonna ruin your brains if you got any you talk all right almost as good as me then he made as if to throw the book into the waste basket and jamie hopped up with a violent start lem laughed then laid the book on the dresser but jamies nerves remained coiled for he knew lem wasnt through with the matter and he was in the right mood for getting things off his chest too then as he stood ready for battle the solution to the problem of seeing retha after work suddenly came to him he would get a place of his own and the idea such a remote possibility minutes before and now so very real filled him with exultation lem saw the moist brown eyes come to life as the thin angular face glowed from an inner fire and for the first time he realized that jamie might soon move out of his reach so youre still messing round that broad from west philly huh he exclaimed as he flung himself into the chair and ran a finger along the pencilmark mustache man shes gonna cut your guts out and wear em for beads i thought you had some sense but jamie did not move nor had the slight smile of wonder left his face and lem knew he was on the wrong track he knocked the ashes from his cigar then pointed it at jamie i guess you know the only way you can get to first base with a dame like that is to have folding cabbage and lots of it jamie knew what lem was building up to but in spite of himself he listened indeed hed been thinking along similar lines himself his eyes grew moody his lips took on a pouting look his common sense told him that retha hodges wouldnt touch him with a tenfoot pole if he got mixed up with the numbers but would she ever have to know lem lit a fresh stogie but kept one eye on jamie to know just when to bring on his clincher then finally he stood up tell you what he began suppose we walk down to th timbers later on i hear ike might drop by sometime tonight and you know he cant hold that book open forever hes losing money man that territorys worth a day if its worth a penny jamies heart thumped like a kettle drum he wished lem would shut up yet desperately he wanted to know how much hed make with such a book the take home pay he got now hardly took him around the corner then finally the walls and the ceiling closed in on him i think ill take a walk he said grabbing frantically for his jacket ill see you later with his cigar delicately poised like a stunted foil lem came forward at the timbers he asked softly jamie hesitated maybe and he practically ran from the room the mild november night hung heavily on his shoulders as he moved wearily down the avenue toward broad street he had little idea where he was going and couldnt care less if retha hodges were not with him then the need to see and talk with her overwhelmed him he found a phone booth in a crowded cutrate drug store and called her she agreed to meet him at a bar out on girard avenue near th street she was waiting for him and he was so glad to see her his voice left him momentarily its late he said finally i know you ought to be home she shook her head its not quite eleven i live just around the corner his heart thudded at the mention of how near her home was to him then he asked the question that was burning a hole in his brain if i had a place would you come to see me sometime she regarded him for a long moment and he wasnt sure whether she wanted to laugh or spit in his face then she smiled and told him she would perhaps sometime he tried to grin but didnt quite make it its not good enough he thought despairingly but it was better than an outright no but what he really wanted to know he couldnt ask or rather didnt want to risk having answered but still but still i love you he blurted out before he was aware the words had even formed on his tongue i know she said quietly then looked away from him damn he thought frantically damn damn damn wasnt she going to say anything more then she spoke again and brought the roof down on his head jamie im engaged to a fellow in law school hes my brothers room mate at howard howard howard university in washington she told him he finishes in june we plan to marry then oh jamie said and the word took off swirling around the room like a stunned insect oh he finally said again his mind unable to think of any other word his heart a ton of lead threatening to pull him through the floor she touched his hand dont look like that jamie i know i should have told you earlier but i kept putting it off thinking that once you werent soso alone maybe you could better cope with the situation he stood in front of the timbers bar a tall lonely figure fingering the change in his pocket the november air was chilled now cutting through his jacket but he seemed not to notice then lem came out and confronted him i been looking for you man come on in ikes waiting but jamie merely shook his head his eyes squinting at the dimly outlined lem i just came to let you know im cutting out he said finally then before lem could reply jamie turned and walked on down the avenue his shoulders bent against the night
seek audacious power by adam clayton powell lmost years ago that question was a contemptuous a f inquiry in the book of john and nathanael said unto philip can there any good thing come out of nazareth e philip saith come and see nazareth was the mississippi of galilee there were no great artists or philosopherkings or musicians there was no center of learning such as howard university in this commencement of your life the world will ask can there any good thing come out of howard as black students educated at americas finest black institution of higher learning you are still secondclass citizens a mere years in the spectrum of time separates us from the history of slavery and a lifetime of indignities next year on march howard will celebrate the centennial of its founding next year on march the committee on education and labor of which i am the chairman will also celebrate its th anniversary how ironic that the committee on education and labor which was formed immediately after the civil war to help black slaves make the transition into freedom should have a black man years later as its chairman one of the purposes of the committees founding was to take care of howard university it is too late for you who are graduating to know this unless you plan to pursue graduate work here but it is not too late for the faculty to know it the education and labor committee is in charge of howard university howard along with other federal institutions such as st elizabeths and gallaudet college is under the jurisdiction of my committee while both howard and i as chairman of this committee will celebrate our years together joy of our success is tempered by the sobering fact that our status as black people has been denied firstclass acceptance keith e baird writing in the spring edition of freedomways gives eloquent voice to these thoughts in his poem nemesis you snatched me from my land branded my body with your irons and my soul with the slavename negro how devilish clever to spell it upper case and keep me always lower to possess a black skin today in america means that if you are in los angeles driving your pregnant wife to a hospital youll be shot to death by a white policeman a black skin means that if your family lives in webster county mississippi your average family income will be a year a week for an entire family a black skin today is an unemployment rate twice that of whites despite a skyrocketing gross national product of billion dollars and an unprecedented level of employment a black skin means you are still a child that all the white liberals who have helped you to take your first steps toward freedom and manhood now believe they own your soul can manage your lives and control your civil_rights organizations only snick has been able to resist the seductive blandishments of white liberals so beware not only of greeks bearing gifts but colored men seeking loans and northern white liberals at this graduation today this is the reality of self you must face your graduation comes at a particularly critical period of the black mans searching reassessment of who he is what he should become and how he should become it the history of the last years of the freedom struggle has been capsuled in only two concepts integration and civil_rights during those years our leadersand black people are the only people who have leadersother groups have politicians statesmen educators financiers and businessmenbut during those years our leaders drugged us with the lsd of integration instead of telling us to seek audacious powermore black_powerinstead of leading us in the pursuit of excellence our leaders led us in the sterile chase of integration as an end in itself in the debasing notion that a few white skins sprinkled amongst us would somehow elevate the genetics of our development as a result ours was an integration of intellectual mediocrity economic inferiority and political subservience like frightened children we were afraid to eat the strong meat of human rights and instead sucked the milk of civil_rights from the breasts of white liberals black uncle toms and aunt jemimas from the book of hebrews a diet of courage is offered to black people for every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil historically strong meat was too risky for most black people for it would have enabled them to discern both good and evil the difference between civil_rights and human rights human rights are godgiven civil_rights are manmade civil_rights has been that grand deception practiced by those who have not placed god first who have not believed that godgiven rights can empower the black man with superiority as well as equality our life must be purposed to implement human rights the right to be secure in ones person from the excessive abuses of the state and its lawenforcing officials the right to freedom of choice of a job to feed ones family the right to freedom of mobility of residence the right to the finest education mans social order can provide and most importantly the right to share fully in the governing councils of the state as equal members of the body politic to demand these godgiven human rights is to seek black_power what i call audacious powerthe power to build black institutions of splendid achievement howard university was once well on its way toward becoming a lasting black institution of splendid achievement when it struggled to contain the intellectual excitement and dynamic creativity of such black scholars as alain locke sterling brown e franklin frazier sam dorsey eugene holmes james nabrit and rayford logan all on the campus at the same time what glorious symbols they were of black creativity but where are the black symbols of creativity of where is the greatness of our yesteryears where are the sonnets black poets once sung of the black mans agony of life can any good thing come out of howard today iv there can and there must i call today for a black renaissance at howard university resurrect black creativity not only in literature history law poetry and english but more so in mathematics engineering aerodynamics and nuclear physics like nicodemus howard must be born againborn again in the image of black greatness gone before will one black woman here today dare to come forth as a pilgrim of god a sojourner truthas a black moses harriet tubmanor a nannie burroughs will one black man here today dare be a denmark vesey a nat turner a frederick douglass a marcus garvey a w e b dubois or a malcolm_x one with god is a majority this divine oneness can restore howard to the glory of charlie houston whose classrooms were the womb of the civil_rights movementa womb that birthed a thurgood marshall but the womb has aborted and the good thing which nvt r rhoward must also come out of black peop v ask yourselves that higher question can any good thing come of black people we are the last revolutionaries in americathe last transfusion of freedom into the blood stream of democracy because we are we must mobilize our wintry discontent to transform the cold heart and white face of this nation indeed we must drop our buckets where we are we must stop blaming whitey for all our sins and oppressions and deal from situations with strength why sit down at the bargaining table with the white man when you have nothing with which to bargain why permit social workers and various leagues and associations to represent us when they are representing the decadent white power structure which pays their salaries their rent and tells them what to say such men cannot possess the noble arrogance of power that inspires men moves nations and decides the fate of mankind i call for more arrogance of power among black people but an arrogance of power that is godinspired godled and goddaring as cassius said the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in yourselves that we are underlings so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity we can cancel the captivity of our souls and destroy the enslavement of our minds by refusing to compromise any of our human rights the era of compromise for the black man is gone birmingham harlem and watts have proved this you cannot compromise mans right to be free nor can you sit down and reason together whether man should have some rights today and full rights tomorrow let somebody reason with mrs barbara deadwyler in los angeles that a white policeman really did not intend to kill her black husband let somebody tell her that the passion of her love for her husband should bow to the reason of diaphanous official alibis only god can reason with her and soothe her grief and there is a god who rules above with a hand of power and a heart of love and if im right hell fight my battle and i shall be free this day this same god calls us first to the conference table and his son when the word of reason was no longer heeded went into the temple and began to cast out those that sold those who sell black people down the river must be cast out those conference tables which defile the human spirit must be overturned conferences are for people who have time to contemplate the number of angels dancing on a civil_rights pin conferences are for people who seek a postponement until tomorrow of a decision which screams for a solution today conferences are an extravagant orgy of therapy for the guiltridden and a purposeless exercise in dialectics for the lazy america has been holding too many conferences conducting too many seminars writing too many books and articles about the black man and his right to freedom for over a century this week black and white people will gather once again in our nations capital to whisper words of futility into the hurricane of massive indifference certainly the federal government should cease to be a partner in this cruel historic charade with the black mans rights to fulfill these rights let us begin with first things first the largest single employer in the united states is the federal government employees yet racial discrimination within the government more subtle more sophisticated more elegantly structuredcontinues almost as rampant as yesterday the times have changed but the system hasnt though racial persecution presses its crown of thorns on our brows our faith in god must never falter we must sustain that faith which helps us to cast off the leprosy of selfshame in our black skins and lift us up to the glorious healing power of belief in the excellence of black_power we must have the faith to build mighty black universities black businesses and elect black men as governors mayors and senators our faith must be sustained by our passion for dignity and our trust in god not mans faithless reason in himself what is easierto say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk black children of howard take up thy beds and walk into the new era of excellence arise and walk into a new spirit of black pride can there any good thing come out of nazareth come and see said philip nathanael came and saw jesus and the world felt as he did the power of his love and the beauty of his words can there any good thing come out of howard university here today come and see you howard graduates must say come and see us erect skyscrapers of economic accomplishment scale mountains of educational excellence and live among the stars of audacious political power come and see us labor for the black massesnot the black leadersbut the black masses who have yearned for audacious leadership violenci in america by dr karl menninger interest in semantics makes me very uncomfortable j f to hear the word violence used as if it were equivalent to iwll lawlessness and the word violence used as if it were equivad d lent to crime or equivalent to murder these are all such different things that im uneasy about the abstraction violence as describing a lot of things that we usually dont like thats why i thought it would be useful if we put down the sort of violence that we disapproved of as a teaching device i often like to change the nature of the reduction suppose we talk about a poker game that seems frivolous enough violence in a poker game is not a very serious matter but lawlessness is perhaps youre not westerners enough to know this nobody gets thrown out of a poker game for violenceperhaps they shouldbut they do for lawlessness once break the rules in a gentlemans game and youre out you can be as violent as you please if the walls will stand it and the furniture will stand it well within limits now in a way this is an example of what errors i think we get into when we keep talking about violence and lawlessness i have only taken two i talked with dr satten and perhaps he will make some further distinctions between words which we in psychiatry use with a good deal more conscientious caution we dont accuse an individual of being violent when he has only been lawless or vice versa then we take a shocking examplelets compare for example the assassination of julius caesar to the assassination of president kennedy i happen to have been like most of my fellow americans a great admirer of mr kennedy and i think the tragedy of his death is almost beyond any words that we could utter but lets look at the fact that the assassination was not very violent all the man did was slightly move his finger whereas brutus had to charge up the steps with the dagger in his hand face the man he was about to kill tell him what he was doing it for and kill him now this glorification of violence which is our heritage as the historian said and which we have praised for centuries as being the earmarks of courage virility manliness and anything else certainly come under a cloud were denouncing violence when i think we mean to denounce something elsedestructivenesswhich usually today is nonviolent most destructiveness today is not accomplished by violence violence is for little fellows violence is for the people that dont know any better violence is like common sense its what the average man has to deal with but destructiveness can now be expressed in such mechanical ways such remote ways such magic ways that our concern it seems to me is actually not so much with violence as with something inside of us which makes us destructive and which makes us willing to be lawless or sadistic or criminal or whatever necessary if we can some way or other make the end justify any means professor freud after spending a lifetime educating his students and the public to the idea that there were within us repressed sexual feelings which caused some of us trouble came to a sudden realization when he was well past middle age and said to his associates gentlemen my critics have said i was too preoccupied with sex and i think they are right now there is something inside the human breast which is also repressed which causes more trouble than sexual frustrations and that is the propensity of human beings to hurt one another to be destructive to be aggressive freud then postulated the dual instinct theory which many of his followers did not accept but which i and many of my friends think is essential you see if you take the view that civilization has in a sense been the progressive repudiation and relinquishing of certain natural trends in the human being you might say civilization goes constantly against the natural law not in the catholic sense but in the psychological sense it seems to be natural for animals including ourselves to assert our own need to try to attain by whatever means necessary what we want when will we learn gradually both in the childhood of the individual and in the childhood of the race that you have to make concessions to the needs of other people you can go even furtheryou can even enjoy making such concessions thats the beginning of the development of the psychological maturity of the individual and the race which puts agape ahead of eros which puts concern ahead of the other person ahead of even the expediency of being good to the other person because he then might be good to you we havent reached it very generally to be sure but we have gone far enough to let me put it another waycivilization has gone to the point where it no longer glorifies aggression as it did its a little ashamed of its violence and its aggression and it does by machinery what it used to do by hand in this sense violence decreases at the wrong place you might say i think if executions were done today as they originally were done in public so that you would see the official violence committed by the state there would be fewer of them even though we know that the desire to see and enjoy violence vicariously is in all of us one of the gentlemen said we tolerate a little violence ladies and gentlemen we not only tolerate it we love it its exciting we put it in the front page of the paper a third or a fourth of our television programs for the amusement of the children are exhibitions of how you can slug them how you can knock them out how you can kick them how you can kill them at long distance or short distance this is what we think is exciting dont forget that violence is condoned my dear friends its enjoyedahproviding theres some escape clause you know in all navaho rugs to give you a little change of mood for a moment the skillful weavers leave one strand of the weaving carried from the simple theme to the edge of the rugwhat looks to nonnavahos as some kind of mistake this is not a mistake this is an alibi this is a way out this is a way to say i havent given away tribal secrets this is the way for the magic of the rug to escape the escape clause so to speak now theres an escape clause in all our violence todaythe forms of violence we can still enjoy a typical illustration of this is the prize fight it seems negligible unimportant and so forth now you see it isnt if you think of this as an example in which the enjoyment of violence can still be permitted even though it is murderous it is mayhem it is corruption as you all know economically it is about everything you could name ordinarily as bad but if it has a name of the right sort if it has a conventional history if it gets by as an escape it is a way in which we can bring the most brutal and aggressive violence right into our livingroom few people today would want to go out and take two of the largest dogs in the community and put them in a pen and see them fight to death this is not quite done according to the rules we dont do it that way weve other ways of being cruel no farmer today would enjoy having two of his bulls gore each other to death but put it in the right auspices and this is lots of fun people think this is wonderful and a large number of our people want to see it extended i think these examples will give you a clue to my own feeling about it and that is that i think it is inevitable who will take the position that all aggression is as judge bazelon says bad it wont be a matter of seeking what kind of aggression can i find today that will be good ill do a little good aggression today but the bad aggression is all the other peoples well get them into court as fast as possible and stop it if one sees aggression in the literal sense the wish to hurt injure other people whether they are criminals whether they are indians or other life whether they are animals living their own peaceful existence whether they are children whatever the other form our task is to eliminate as far as we can to control to harness to sublimate to direct our own aggressive impulses and that of our colleagues away from the enjoyment of causing pain in other people i dont believe there is such a thing as good aggression now youre going to say to me well now arent you carrying this too far what would you do if somebody came to your house and wanted to kill your children wouldnt you be aggressive of course i would i dont say that all occasions for the necessary use of something bad have disappeared i wouldnt ordinarily crawl out through the top of an elevator car for athletic amusement but i did last week in new york because we got stuck between floors and remained there for a half an hour i did some very extraordinary things that i wouldnt ordinarily do i would say if somebody comes to my house and attacks me i shall exercise myself as vigorously as possible however in the meantime i dont intend to provide an arsenal and dont intend to stock up with a number of guns revolvers and other weapons so that i can keep the villain out personally i think this would be a thin disguise for my own aggressive impulses that almost it seems to me would be inviting some masochist to come in and see if i can hit him im not going to experiment i dont think in psychiatry generally there is an agreement with so flatfooted a quaker position as i take if you stop to think the joys of yesteryear were largely those of killing something in my part of the country especially a little further west most of the northern california indians were shot off as a matter of sport by your ancestors and mine who lived there it was considered good weekend fun to go out and kill a few indians as a hunting exercise the same thing was done in many other places but this was so well documented one whole large tribe was exterminated just north of here a little way you must remember that this was done with the blessing of the community of course some of the women thought it was a rather rough sport it would be much better if their husbands stayed home and knocked each other out in a slug fest or something but some of the boys wanted to go out and get a little blood and they did you see i find it quite foreign to my concept of psychiatry to regard these to discount this as being the work of the psychotic population my dear friends i think were all a psychotic population there is no such thing as the psychotic population mental illness is a condition from which everyone of us suffers at one time or another to different degrees and it is neither thee nor thou business or me and thou business to say well those psychotic people theyre the ones that do these things you and i are the psychotic people in the sense that you and i are the ones who are aware that there are fluctuations in our ability to organize and manage our aggressions and the temptations of the outside world some people are less aware of this fact but i think that this holierthanthou attitude toward the psychiatrically ill is incorrect im not going to take a holierthanthou attitude toward the attitude i only make the distinction that i dont think this is the correct way to see it if you take such a survey as that manhattan survey you realize it mental illness is not something that unfortunately drops down on a few individuals like lee harvey oswald and causes him to do surreptitious things mental illness is something that afflicts all of us to some degree all of us at times and many people all of the timeor much of the time with constant fluctuation this view of psychiatry is so different from the old one where we thought we could go through the population and pick out maybe one or three or four out of a thousand who needed the care of the state institution or the boston psychopathic this view of psychiatry is as dead as a dodo we recognize now that this was a limitation of our vision at that time just as we recognize now that shooting off indians at the time when there was a mutualrobbery program going on was the feud of it i often think in sunday school in bible classes how different it looks when you think of the children of israel conquering jericho and marching forth against the occupants how different it looks if you imagine yourself to be a descendant of the occupants the same way the american indians how different it looks if you are a descendant of the navahosless the navahos than the sioux let us say with whom i have spent some time if you look at it from their point how different it looks the war in which custer and others so bravely exterminated the fiendish savage if you happen to be on the other side think how the indians felt about people who felt that it was their privilege to come in and steal your stuff but it was not your privilege to steal theirs here we are a nation that violated treaties with the indians who never once broke their side of the contract when one talks about lawlessness and violence you must remember as our historian said this has been a pattern which we havent been until recently very much ashamed of you heard it in the political campaign and you hear it in my part of the country quite a bit by god im going to do so and so the very tone of voice is a kind of violence a kind of confession that i do not recognize the necessity to control violence i regard violence as something without which on this rough planet you cant live and im going to observe it in the right way in my judgment of course now these remarks are tendentious and they are not intended to be a calm cold scientific analysis of the topic partly as i say because i think we havent sufficiently clearly identified our topic our kind host said that he was thinking of the kind that seemed unmotivated but if i may terminate what ive been saying by direct reference to that i think that is only because you and i are not close enough to that individual to know what the motives were what seems senseless to us is because we dont know man it isnt the way i would have killed those people it isnt the way that i would have acted on that elevator but i am not he i didnt have the background he did i didnt have the frustrations he did i didnt have the irritations he did i didnt have the insults flung in my face that hes had im imagining a situation but my point is that cases that seem inexplicable to use are so partly because were assuming that the life the background the experiences the motions the suffering of the individuals who do these terrible things that make us shudder with horror are not the same as ours if we mean therefore to study violence we must study the people that cant get along that cant cope with the realities of life in a civilized way i think dr satten my colleague here has contributed something very important in the scientific american article where he points out that our attitude towards offenders has been almost one of saying since i cant understand you i am angry at you therefore i am not willing to try to help you change i only want you punished this conventional attitude should be corrected judge bazelon has been trying to do it for a few individuals sooner or later it seems to me it ought to be an expression of our civilization that we are not interested in returning violence for violence that we are interested in trying to bring about change in the people who cant live in a way that will allow us to be safe especially as we get closer together out west where there are greater spaces where it takes longer for the bad news to spread where people can get away with more without being caught by their neighbors its a different matter from where we live just apartment to apartment now that more people see what human beings act like when theyre a little off guard when they are a little stimulated by you and when they have been a little deficient in the civilizing process there is more interest in trying to find better ways to control a the people who fail to control themselves and commit violence and b those who might do so under the right circumstances which includes all of us its in the game by lucille clifton sr eric berne firl missed what might n j j j have been the most provocative and contemporary chapter of all in his currently popular book games people play when he failed to include in it any examples of the games sweeping the circuit of newly integrated neighborhoods there are many they usually in their elementary form involve two players often nextdoor neighbors and women and always one black and one white it is the basic and most important rule one of the most popular is called what she would have said in the old neighborhood and black housewife as usual is it for example white housewife your hair is lovely did you do it yourself black housewife thank you it was getting so dry and unmanageable that i simply had to give myself a permanent black dialogue learned to read early when many of the other kids were h outside playing ball or swinging on the playground swingsbefore the time of tvhe was usually curled up with a book of course he played ball and romped with his succession of dogs and skated but he also read and reading took the place a lot of the time of building model airplanes or doing what other seven or eightyearold negroes do the first book his mother gave him was black boy she had always read to him until he had gotten too big and then she began getting him books from the library but black boy was the first book she bought particularly for him she hardly ever told him about the world about what to look for in life unless it was a part of her vision of the promising future he guessed her ways were to be a protection for him but later the only thing he felt they had done was to have him disbelieve in dreams whenever he grew old enough to be made aware of something like sex or that he was a negro and he would be treated differently in the world because of this phenomenon she left him a book on his night table and so she gave him black boy by richard wright to enlighten him and his life long held recurrences of that horrible experience after he had read the autobiography of richard wright he had been psychologically unable to read another negro author for over ten years but his mother never knew and he didnt even admit the fact to himself he had just refused to believe there were any other negro writers and that made it unnecessary even accidentally to relive the trauma of black boy he immediately stopped reading harmless frank yerby when he found that yerby was a negro and he refused until his late teens to read books by whites with negro themes and subjects it was frightening to believe almost everything that one read not that he should not believe an autobiography he told himself but he believed literally in the characters of books when young and in their situations but unfortunately these characters were almost always white no tom sawyer or huck finn for him there were blackmen in them come back up on the raft huck honey the monstrous life that wright portrayed in that book could as well have been histhis was one of the fears he screamed of at night in all his reading until then and most since except for whitman that was the single character with which he felt a definite spiritual kinship and he attempted to strangle that apparitions first breath his hands are still partially encircling its black throat the description of wrights whitelooking grandmother was like those he had heard of some of his distant relatives and he did have a very fair aunt with long stringy hair who was old enough to be a grandmother and the entire similarity scared him more thoroughly than all the promised damnations of hell in the bible he did not understand why he compared that experience of reading black boy to cringing under the denunciations of the ancient prophets and fearing for the immortal everlasting soul he believed in then but reading that book he somehow feared for himself as he has few times since could it be that in both cases he would be equally lost was to be black to be told and demonstrated in graphic detail equivalent to smelling fire and brimstone to be among the unsaved it cant be this way his childs mind reasoned i wont believe it is like this i dont live like this no one does at least no one i know so what is this man in this book saying these things for what is he doing to me why is he trying to destroy me with all his will he fought the accusations of living in a false world of childhood and adolescent comfort and smugness but he knew that man spoke the truth that that black man was right that things he described in such brutal detail did really happenonly in a different place he could not believe that such things confronted him down south thats it he reasoned down south for he had heard of down home numerous occasions through tale jest and tabletalk of the elders though he could not imagine where the country was or if it were actually a real place or an illusionary one like the story lands of ghosts and witches and trolls he never knew until much later that he was alreadyand soon would be even moreacquainted with the south and he had such a fear and hate instilled in him for down home that even much later it was vital for him to be objective and not allow prejudice to infect his feelings when he met someone with a hard southern accentwhether they were black or white but most of his newer friends were recently arrived from down home and the way in which they spoke of the land they had fled it was a distant wonderland far superior toand unlikethe then fabulous farm in new jersey of his nearly white aunt they must lie he felt he knew they lied and he secretly hated them the more for their trying to deceive him his new friends from the south acted differently so strange and awkward their first years in the city and not like himself who knew the citys ways he thought then and some of these new friends have never changed he wasnt afraid to speak to whites or shy in their presence like many of his friends were no he went to school with whites everyday and would punch one in the mouth if he wasnt his friend or if he had gotten out of line he even walked sylvia greenglass home each day of his next to last year in elementary school carrying her books and sometimes staying late at her house for the hot creamy chocolate that her mother made on chilly days sylvia with the auburn hair and pink cheeks and ears that brightened crimson in the wintertime he thought of that day when he walked her home and his friends from school threw snowballs at them and sylvia and he laughed and trotted along with him stooping in the cold scooping up the icy whiteness and returning the volleys at brother and timmy his two friends up seventh street yelling and panting out clouds of steam until one of the snowballs hit sylvias ear the instance froze like it was etched by icicles to freeze his heart then sylvia and he hurried the last six blocks to her house as she cried and his knowing that it was an awful accident which found him helpless after the damage was done but he whispered to himself that he could have prevented it by being nearer her warding off the balls of snow and ice he couldnt explain to mrs greenglass when she opened the door sylvia stood there on the landing whimpering and sputtering about her ear and he begged forgiveness as if he had made the little pink girl his target her mother did not invite him in that afternoon nor any other and sylvia stopped playing with him at recess nor would she allow him to walk her home again he hated the ones who threw at them that afternoon hated them for causing the trouble but they were his friends brother and timmy the other two negroes in the school they called themselves colored in those days he hated his two friends for parting him from a white girl the game today is being probably still played with the exact results brother had a soft southern accent and had been only in the city for a couple years but brother knew more things about the streets and how its people acted than he did they remained friends for over ten years but to him brother was always a southern negro a newcomer and so not really a friend timmy was from a family with a lot of kids and his big brothers always threatened to beat him up and take his possessions until he got big enough not to take threats from anyone to him he seemed long in getting that big but the day came when he couldnt allow any more sleights to go unchallenged and during the course of those years he had lost all those old friends and no others had he hated so much nor has he met since that have replaced them it has been always too easy for him to take up with the white world it has been always too easy to find some sort of acceptance from whites somehow he had learned to speak in a close enough approximation to their way his reading had conditioned him to search in the world for many of their values he had gone to the same schools with them being for the first six years the single negro in his classes and always near the top that type of conditioning is murderous to throw off at once it is subtle and almost sure in most cases to twist a black soul into a hybrid freak of some kind it lulls the victim into refusing to see the darker aspects of the world it gives him a pair of second false blue eyes to gaze distortedly through a black caught like this gets to thinking that white people are all right which isnt hard to believe when he is far enough out of the mans reach and his mother has a civil service job but then later when he grows up there are other factors to consider weird factors which lead to the edge of insanity he wonders after a while and he tries again to reorganize his multihued funnypaper collaged world with strictly white values thinking white logic with blackwhite experiences and often he becomes bitter or skeptical or worse especially when he finds it is other blacks closer to him doing him more obvious treachery than the whites when he finds that he is not white even though his mind wishes to believe there is a sameness that his inner black eyes cannot detect he wishes to stop believing in justice fair play honor and truth why did they prepare me only for this lie he wonders when one finds he must become unfeeling out of a sense of protection as those who do not feel nor wish to know or feel then sometimes he turns his back upon his own people and upon himself and becomes all the more disillusioned for that is when he is really alone and is lost the white world prepares the black man in a single universal skill treachery to his fellows v no man lies to a black man more than another black man no man cheats or is ready to kill another black man as quickly as another black man one must become accustomed to the perplexities of this brotherhood if he is to survive and learn and understand why one must lose faith for faith is never quite enough one must throw away belief for belief is held by every black fool one must be blown apart by all that one has been taught and reassembled in the vacuum of ignoranceofblack to form the vessel of new experience there is not a white man alone he feared to face though he is wary of each of his black brothers for ancient betrayal waits behind each smile and set of dark eyes all white groups he enters with caution for the collective will of their numbers is to keep him in his place whether it is in front of the firing squad or standing at a poduim before an expanse of equally black faces no black group does he fear but it is the influence of the manipulators in the outer wings which he cares to avoid it is as true today as it was years ago in this land blacks meet together only because some white desires their congregation and blacks are compelled to seek fraternity through the urging of white sympathizers and exploiters the black man in america is the loneliest human in the universe and he can sense freedom most in his loneliness when he is unencumbered by the society of his fellow blacks who are unwittingly guided by whites he transition from sprinter on a u s olympic team to dipr u lomat in the u s foreign service

that precisely is what i propose to doalthough in truth both the rationale and method of my suggested expansionis i are somewhat unique from the war for independence until the s the united states was one of the most expansionistic nations on earth rivaling the british french and russian empires in the relationship of original size to the extent of new territory added unlike the typical european government however the united states followed a policy of absorbing the new territories as integral parts of the nation as states subject only to the limitation that angloamericans had to predominate over natives thus statehood was never available to indians or to native hawaiians and oklahoma new mexico arizona hawaii and alaska all had to wait until the nonwhites had become sufficiently outnumbered or anglicized and neutralized angloamerican imperialism assumed a new form precisely when it came into contact with regions inhabited by nonwhites who were too numerous to be outnumbered where angloamericans could never predominate generally speaking the flag could not go this racist and ethnocentric doctrine ironically was a major factor in saving mexico in the s hawaii temporarily in the s the dominican republic in the s and probably cuba the philippines and other regions at a later date nevertheless imperialism continued but it assumed the form of acquiring economic and political dominance over foreign nations without formal annexation the united states was freed from the problem of reconciling the constitution with colonialism does the constitution follow the flag and freed from facing up to the ideal that all u s territories possess a right to eventual statehood the united states in brief established a protectorate over much of the americas and more recently over the pacific area and was thus able to benefit from empire without being forced to face the problems posed by the direct administration of subject peoples except of course in the philippines samoa puerto rico the canal zone guam hawaii and the various indian tribal regions this protectorate system continues to exist especially in relation to the caribbean region president lyndon b johnson both in sending marines to intervene in a purely internal rebellion and in asserting the united states right to intervene anywhere in the americas has reaffirmed the old teddy roosevelt philosophy but in addition to this straightforward presidential policy the united states has long used ambassadors aid programs and the cia to influence other governments and of course most of the caribbean nations are economically dominated by the united states the ironic effect of the above is that the dominican republic and the other small nations of the caribbean would possess more freedom from federal u s interference and greater autonomy as states of the united states than they do as socalled independent republics as states they would be protected by the constitution and by the courts they could socialize the economy by confiscating illegallyacquired private property and they could elect senators and representatives who would have an impact on federal policies as republics they are not protected by the constitutions separation of powers doctrinethey are subject to federal u s intervention without constitutional restraint they are in short subjected to behavior which would never be tolerated by a sovereign state of the united states is this reasoning false then let us for a moment contrast the sovereignty of states such as mississippi and alabama with that of the dominican republic the former are states wherein virtually half the population is subjected to violence is held in a subordinate status and is denied the right to exercise constitutional privileges the governments of mississippi and alabama are in fact in a state of rebellion against the united states even to the extent of the flying of a rebel flag and the wearing of rebel insignias in alabama but has this led to intervention has president johnson dispatched marines to protect american lives and to separate the antagonists has federal power been exerted to organize coalition whitenegro governments it is generally true that the federal government rarely intervenes in the affairs of states even in the face of the most blatant provocations little rock and oxford being notable and rather smallscale exceptions on the other hand the federal government finds it much easier to intervene overseas as it has within our own century in haiti cuba the dominican republic nicaragua panama colombia mexico guatemala and elsewhere the dominican republic unlike mississippi and alabama does not possess representation in congress nor votes in presidential elections as indicated above no constitutional guarantees enforceable by an independent judiciary protect its interests therefore president johnson is able to dispatch marines on a large scale to dominicana to prevent the reestablishment of constitutional government and in fact to dictate the form a new government will assume can anyone imagine such an intervention in the south for these and other reasons to be outlined below i feel that the only decent policy for the united states to pursue is to make formal offers of immedate statehood to dominicana haiti jamaica puerto rico micronesia the ryukyus and to other regions which are either colonies or protectorates of the united states please bear in mind that i do not advocate the unilateral annexation of these areas i merely wish to offer the various protectorates of the united states a choice between their present status subject to the capricious intervention of the federal government and a status wherein they possess an influence upon that government the dominican republic as was cuba prior to castro is in fact a territory of the united states it should be allowed the option of statehood another important point in relation to the caribbean region is that the united states regards the several islands therein as being of such great strategic significance as to be for practical purposes a part of the united states home defense system as things now stand the united states will never allow any of these islands to pursue independent courses of action this is true of cuba as well after all the united states was not kidding in the bay of pigs affair given this reality should not the united states at least offer the west indians the right to vote in presidential elections and thereby have some say in their own security system the caribbean republics have nominally two choices now on the one hand they can remain protectorates of the united states or on the other hand they can seek freedom of action within the context of the communist bloc cuba was able to make that choice the others however will not be able to follow that path for the simple reason that the united states will undoubtedly intervene with full force in any leftwing revolution any attempt therefore to establish other cubas will simply result in the killing of thousands of people and u s military occupation therefore the only realistic alternative to a protectorate status is that of statehood the situation is somewhat different in the case of puerto rico micronesia samoa the canal zone and the ryukhus these regions are already attached to the united states by formal instruments my proposals here are very simple we should encourage the formation of a polynesian federation which samoa can join or as an alternative allow samoa and any of its neighbors to form a state micronesia the trust territory of the pacific and guam should be allowed the option of statehood here no other alternative can be provided since the united states will doubtless never let these islands go for military reasons the ryukyus should be offered the choice of statehood or reunion with japan but the latter is not a likely course of action since the united states seems firmly attached to this military bastion perhaps in this instance it might be possible to create a selfgoverning ryukuan free state under the joint supervision of the united states and japan but in the event that the united states chooses to retain unilateral control what other decent alternative is there to an offer of statehood the case of the canal zone is somewhat unique in that it involves an area not suited for either statehood or independence but then the zone is nothing more or less than u soccupied panama and it should be turned over to the latter if on the other hand military considerations are such that we cannot part with the zone then we should offer panama statehood and the canal that would provide the panamanians with a unified territory and with some say in the control of their own destiny puerto rico is an associated free state or commonwealth of the united states as such it possesses nearly the same powers as a state internally but has no voting representation in washington many people are under the impression that puerto rico can have statehood or independence if she wishes the truth is however that puerto rico could never be independent of the united states except in a strictly formal sense and statehood must be approved by congress rumor from washington has it that congress is not encouraging puerto rico to ask for statehood and it may be that cultural and racial chauvinists are opposed to a state not dominated by angloamericans nevertheless it would be a good gesture for congress to pass an enabling act allowing puerto rico to assume statehood at the latters discretion such a step would help to diminish the worlds suspicion that the united states is intolerant of racial and cultural minorities my advocacy of offers of statehood to all of the aforementioned regions is based on the rather simple principle that all men should possess the right of local selfgovernment and the right to directly participate in the formulation of nonlocal and international policies the peoples of the caribbean micronesia samoa and the ryukyus among others are not allowed one or both of these fundamental rights and it is intolerable that the united states should be the power preventing the exercise of those rights therefore either the united states must cease intervening overseas and give away its colonies or it must pursue forthwith the only decent alternative that of offering statehood and the rights of citizenship to these peoples but in all frankness there are other reasons behind my favoring the growth of the united states for one i am a little afraid of the provincial angloamerican as he is found in his purity especially in the south and middle west i like the white anglosaxon diluted as he is in new york boston new orleans san francisco los angeles santa fe san antonio and all of the other more interesting and culturally more productive regions of the united states i do not care for the middle towns or suburbs where the anglo predominates to the exclusion of other groups and here i include those irishamericans germanamericans et cetera who have become completely anglicized i am frankly worried about the domestic and foreign policies apparently favored by the present consensus among anglo politicians and i am even more frightened by the lunatic right with its notsolatent racist potential in short i believe that we need a new infusion of the kind of invigoration formerly provided by immigration and of the kind of counterbalancing diverse sectional interests favored by madison in the federalist papers for this reason also i would favor union with canada but that is another subject in a similar vein i strongly desire a greater cosmopolitanism within the united states and a more varied cultural atmosphere with increased opportunity for contributions by nonanglos we need the healthy influence of more mulattoes more negroes more mestizos more pacific islanders and more latins and not only are the cultural variations provided by these peoples fascinating and enriching but i personally find that the hybrids who result from the intermingling of such peoples are extremely attractive physically and otherwise there should be more hawaiis more seriously however the united states must rapidly become more cosmopolitan if it is to successfully meet its responsibilities as the leading power in the noncommunist world the american people must become more sophisticated more tolerant and better informed i do believe that union with nonanglo peoples will help not only to demonstrate the existing degree of tolerance in the united states but to actually further the process of cosmopolitanization and sophistication needless to state chauvinists and rightwingers will most certainly oppose my plan for the growth of the united states precisely out of fear of the reasons for which i advocate it they do not want more orientals more negroes more mixedbloods and more race mixture they do not want to see their dear old angloamerican provincial culture further diluted although they will accept pizza above all they do not wish to see votes go to people who might well suppport socialism or economic reform or who will suport strong civil_rights programs or who might well seek to tone down the unilateralism of united states foreign policy and then of course these same people have never really given a hoot about freedom for nonanglos in order to preserve the freedom or advance the interests of angloamericans as they see it they have been perfectly willing to take freedom away from other peoples the opposition of the chauvinists to my plan only serves however to strengthen my faith in its essential wisdom and justice why shouldnt we make a try at it after all an offer of statehood is probably one of the least offensive things that we can do and it may be that the united states is destined to grow again whether or not you or i wish it let us make sure that its growth is by voluntary and legitimate meansand not alone by the progress of marching armies the way i see it by bill veeck e are such hypocrites when alvin dark was quoted as e in team pride cries of righteous indignation filled the air utumirqjiu and yet anyody who has spent any time around ball parks knows that if dark did say what he was quoted as saying he was only echoing what was being muttered on every bench and in every clubhouse it was unfortunate that either alvin did not get down to specifics or that the columnist in quoting him preferred to approach the issue in generalities as a way of opening up the subject to the widest possible discussion and debate it was unfortunate too that because dark himself happens to come from the south anything he might say is evaluated by a completely different set of standards than if hubert humphrey had said it now no one can tell me that alvin didnt know his own ballplayers better than anyone else or that alvin didnt see what he saw if he had said that orlando cepeda who happens to come from puerto rico or that willie mccovey who happens to be an american negro werent the leading candidates for the team player of the year award hed have found any number of baseball people ready to agree with him dark isnt the first manager to feel that cepeda wasnt putting out to the limits of his capabilities nor would he have been the first to say that mccovey tended to lose interest in that rather large portion of the ball game when he wasnt at the plate swinging a bat of course baseball people have always said that jackie brandt doesnt play up to his capabilities either and no one has ever felt it necessary to observe that they sure do grow them lazy in nebraska they just nicknamed him flakey and let it go at that what you always have to bear in mind is that cepeda may very well feel in his heart that he is playing to the peak of his ability at first anyway but human nature is human nature if you keep telling a player he is lazy he just may say to himself all right ill show them how lazy i can be it takes a little imagination to perceive that anybody who is called the baby bull needs coddling and yet i have a strong hunch that if every time a giant manager had felt like blasting cepeda he had called in the newspapermen and told them what a joy it was to have the baby bull on his team things would be a lot calmer along the banks of san francisco bay these days as for mccovey well they kept telling me for twenty years that ted williams took a very casual attitude toward fly balls too but nobody even felt moved to draw any generalities about tall lefthanded hitters from san diego but whatever limitations mccovey may have when he is not swinging at a fast ball are certainly not the limitations of a teammate named willie mays as dark would be the first to attest mays is a flaming genius in the outfield he catches everything he cuts off balls between outfielders he makes the right throw to the right base he is in the starting lineup day after day until he quite literally drops from exhaustion we all know how that story reads by now mays collapses into a dead faint and the giants lose two or three games before he gets back into the lineup one might even say that willie is the symbol of the team man in baseball just as jackie robinson was the symbol of the competitor you can tell me latinamerican players are lazy and i will listen to you politely but please do not tell me that minnie minoso whom i first signed out of cuba in was lazy minnie would be in there hustling for games a year he might be carrying ten pounds of tape around his body but hed still be giving you his standard percent because minnie was one of the greatest competitors i have ever seen if we want to talk about team spirit we can talk about maury wills leading the dodgers to the pennant although he was sliding on legs that were raw and bloody if we want to compare iqs we can talk about bill white of the cardinals who made himself into a topflight player through intelligence and application i can remember a game when my dear friend larry doby tried to steal home against the yankees in a ridiculous situation and i stated publicly that it was a stupid play because it was but that didnt make him stupid because hes not i just wanted to know what had got into him you can understand why stupid people do stupid things it is always difficult to understand why a bright man does a stupid thing in other words if we started to list the exceptions to the overall indictment we just might end up with a list containing more names than the nonexceptionswhich would put the exceptions in the majority and make the nonexceptions the exceptions and aw lets forget about it the point im trying to make here quite obviously is that individuals are bright and dumb selfish and selfsacrificing good and bad races are just a collection of individuals i suppose that the negro will know he has come to full equality when he is granted the glorious right to take all the credit for his triumphs and all responsibility for his failings i do not expect it to happen tomorrow morning a home run is without color nationality or previous condition of servitude and so is a bonehead play it may not be completely irrelevant that the terms bonehead play and rockhead were a part of the language of baseball while the color line still stood pure and inviolable if we check the record books we may even discover that they were applied to players who were light of hue and backed to the hilt by generations of good anglosaxon forebears the difference of course is that nobody has ever said there goes that dumb white soandso again this does not mean that im copping out on the subject by delivering the usual profound and resounding liberal manifestos which are really meant to prove that i am pure of heart i think the indictment whether dark made it or not has enough merit in enough cases to be worthy of much closer examination we need more than anything else to be less selfconscious about race it has become so difficult to discuss this subject on its merits because you are a loser no matter which way you go it is an accepted part of one branch of american folklore that the negro is almost a different speciesand not a higher one these people are willing to concede that the negro is superior physically because he is inferior mentally a somewhat dubious compliment to the other side it is holy writ couched though it may be in vague scientific terms that there is absolutely no difference between any people anywhere and that anyone who thinks there is or might be is a dirty bigot who should be stoned out of the communitypresumably toward the end of keeping that spirit of scientific inquiry alive at the risk of being stoned i want to stand up boldly and say that there is a difference between black and white black is darker white is lighter if we cant agree on that were in real trouble there are physical differences between races too when i was in japan last year to telecast the japanese allstar game the one thing that impressed me above everything else was the weakness of japanese throwing arms even though their ball parks are somewhat smaller than ours no outfielder is expected to make a throw directly to a base a cutoff man goes out automatically to relay all throws the way it was explained to me the japanese shoulder is so constructedon a downward slopethat it is almost impossible for them to throw a ball that will rise as soon as a boy gives any indication of having a strong arm he is pressed into service as a pitcher and here as it was explained to me is the most interesting part of all almost all pitchers i was told are the fruit of a mixed marriage with an inhabitant of one of the offshore islands it is an infusion of blood in other words that changes the construction of the shoulder w but that isnt too surprising either who among us hasnt observed that the mixture of oriental and white blood produces women whose beauty takes the breath away i believe it is known among the more learned academicians in mississippi as mongrelization the american negro has a physical difference too he can run faster and jump higher question asked with an appropriate sneer what authority do you cite mr veeck for this flat unequivocal and unscientific statement answer the greatest authority i know the authority of my own observations which means far more to me than anything out of an anthropologists tract i know that negroes can run faster because i have observed them running faster on baseball and football fields i have observed that when the six finalists in any dash event of any national track meet to say nothing of conference championships crouch over the starting line a minimum of five of them will be negroes usually it is all six my eyes also tell me that negroes jump higher because i can see that almost all the best high jumpers are negroes and so are almost all the best rebounders in the national basketball association to say nothing of any college campus i am able to cite one other authority to support me you almost all sports fans and certainly all athletes accept the fact that negroes run faster and jump higher give me all the theories you can find about sociological and economic forcesand i will give you a few backbut lets not permit anybody to bull us into saying that we dont know what we are seeing there are sociological economic and psychological factors that push the negro into sports sure that can hardly be the entire story though because i am sure there are plenty of towhaired farm boys from nebraska who want to win the meter olympic dash just as badly and practice as hard as any negro boy they just get shut out in the quarterfinals thats all after all records are falling in all track events these days and white runners are setting their share of the new ones the same sociologic and economic pressures would surely apply to all events it is only in all the dashes and the high jump that the negro has his monopoly in point of fact there is a physical basis to account for their superiority as dashmen and jumpers the negro has a somewhat different bone formation in his ankle which gives him an extra cushion off which to spring basketball is a game which seems to have been practically invented for the negro it is a game of particularly sharp reflex of sudden spurts and quick stops of jumping and of timing it is therefore logically enough a game which is becoming increasingly dominated by negroes the nba has already reached the stage where the operators for reasons having to do with nothing more than customer identification are willing to take a and man who are white over negroes who have slightly more ability you will notice that i slipped in the words sharp reflex and i can already hear the snickering out there that goes yeah and they all have rhythm too huh the implication being that anyone who dares to say that negroes have a more basic sense of rhythm is giving him the benefit of the doubt stupid giving myself the benefit of the doubt i dont think im so stupid the national league is superior to the american league these days becauseand no one even bothers to argue this anymore except a few chronic searchers after lost causesbecause the national league stocked up on negro players while the american league was sitting back and admiring how nicely the yankees were getting along without them in the national league had fifteen hitters twelve of them were colored the year before the national league had eleven hitters ten of them were colored it would seem fairly clear then that negroes are better hitters than whites no not more deprived not better motivated we re not talking about that better hitters hitting is reflex and timing in short rhythm it is always possible that there are physicalmeaning biological factors involved that go far beyond our knowledge in the first place what is a negro we have a way in this country of arbitrarily characterizing anybody with any negro blood in him as negro it would seem to me that anybody with one negro grandparent is three quarters white and that my side is entitled to take credit for percent of him remembering what the infusion of island blood does for the japanese throwing arm and sighing over those bea itiful eurasian women i have to wonder whether anybody has really conducted meaningful and objective experiments on the relationship of the percentage of negro blood to athletic ability wouldnt it be funny if they really owed it all to us the real question is why there should be any question of the negros superiority in these directions at all the answer i suppose is that both races seem to be more comfortable ignoring it the white man doesnt like to think that the negro is superior in a basic test of strength and skill the negro knows that to be superior is to be different and he has learned that differences have a way of being used against him still i have a sneaking suspicion that when negroes gather together in the privacy of their own parlors they are quite willing to boast about their physical superiority over their little white brothers as for the economic and sociological factors they are so apparent that they are almost not worth going into the american negro is not as far removed from the purely physical life as the white man he is after all only years removed from the harsh life of slavery he still finds himself on the whole limited to harsh physical work next time you see a crew of movers you will notice that the white men have assigned themselves the arduous task of telling the negro how to carry a piano on his back this is known as integration italics editors having been denied the fruits of our soft society the negro has been denied the luxury of growing soft in the bone and muscle negro athletes even last much longer than white athletes which can only mean that the point of physical deterioration comes much earlier even in the best trained white athlete the economic problem is simple the performing artssports and entertainmenthave attracted a disproportionate share of the negro population because they have provided the only fields to which the negro has had free entree it could almost be said that if a negro has it in him to be an athlete he has to give it a try and because he knows there is a stone wall waiting for him to butt his head against in the event he doesnt make it he will throw all his energy into developing his talents now that seems to fly in the face of our original theme doesnt it if the negro can run faster react quicker and is in addition more highly motivated how can it also be said that he is lacking in team pride and spirit an entirely different set of circumstances comes into play here we are speaking of these players after they have made it and remember we are still talking about a minority of a minority we are moving into the area of human relations now because we are involved with the relationship between black and white in the united states more particularly we are dealing with the hidden emotional dialogue that passes back and forth between them below the surface behind the spoken word at the root of the difficulty is the white mans beliefwhy is this so difficult to shakethat the negro should be grateful for being allowed to play in the big leagues the same quality that the fans most admired in eddie stanky his combativeness was the very quality they criticized in jackie robinson it was as if they were saying whats the matter doesnt he appreciate the chance were giving himwhich could only mean that they did not really believe he was as entitled to that chance as the kid next door by the same token i suspect that managers and players will criticize a colored player who seems to be lackadaisical far more than they would criticize a white teammate when a colored player loafs he is showing they feel that he does not appreciate what has been done for him which againcan only mean that they still consider him at this hidden emotional level to be something less than equal the negro having developed antennae which are perfectly attuned to that wave length picks it up understands and is not gladdened robinson always reacted to criticism by playing harder but people are different other negroes finding this sort of peripheral prejudice existing at the point where they had thought they had escaped from it react by drawing back into themselves it is more than possible you know that the negro in the ghetto never feels rejected with quite the intensity of the negro who becomes a celebrity in the great unghettoized worldas a bigleague ballplayer let us sayand then finds that all the success in the world does not make him immune from the same old slights and humiliations even here of course human beings react in a multiplicity of ways to find that nothing you can do can change your situation can be a great comfort to some since it means that no further fighting is necessary to others it is the ultimate rejection it was paul robeson the negro who achieved popular acclaim of his time who became the most disaffected of all negroes the white players are aware if only subconsciously that what is really bugging the negro are the conditions that have been imposed upon him as a negro human nature being what it is their reaction is to turn the situation completely around since his moodiness arises out of the fact of his being a negro then it becomes a simple matter for the white player to tell himself that is the natural result of his being a negro sure he thinks to himself all of them are like that it is far more comforting we can all agree to blame him and his race than to blame us and our race so here we go again it is now the negros turn to react a second time to the white teammates reaction to him if a man is made to feel that he is not accepted as a member of the country the community or the team he will come to feel that he is a member of nothing except the negro race and that he owes allegiance to the negro race only this is not an attitude that is going to leave a man brimming over with team pride the problems of the latin american are somewhat different and probably even more complicated to give you an idea of the problem confronting him do this for me take one of his white teammates away from his home and family put him down in a caribbean village where nobody speaks his language have him eat strange foods which emphasize his foreignness and also upset his stomach have him faced socially in this imaginary village with completely newand bewilderingcustoms which discriminate against him make it perfectly clear to him that he is not considered quite the equal of the natives and that while no offense is intended it would be greatly appreciated if he would be a good fellow and keep his distance he just might feel that he is an outsider he just might not have any flaming loyalty to his team he might even have trouble remembering what his teams name is when he does manage to find the ball park the manager has to pass on all instructions to him in this strange language necessitating a certain amount of sign language and a certain tone of voice that reminds him uncomfortably of the tone that is used toward a particularly backward child it is just possible that he might be uncertain and hesitant and being uncertain and hesitant he might not go about his work with his accustomed snap and vigor he might not even want to if you treat a man like a migratory worker he will act like a migratory worker this is the situation admittedly carried to its extreme that the latinamerican players have been confronted with as they begin to come up to the big leagues in greater number they naturally tend to group together in the clubhouse as well as off the field much in the way american players would group together in puerto rico much in fact as americans have traditionally grouped together within their own cities clubhouse cliques have always been a part of the baseball scene but this is something new this clique speaks in a foreign tongue this is a foreign colony setting itself up in the last american stronghold the baseball clubhouse you see them there chattering away in spanish and every once in a while you are left with the uneasy feeling that these foreigners are talking about you and laughing at you if they want to play here and take home our money you think to yourself why dont they speak english like everybody else if you are half intelligent you dont carry that kind of thinking too far and yet some of the resentment remains enough of it remains at any rate so that when you can find an outlet by criticizing them for something that is obviously true an easier attitude toward their work you are not slow to seize upon it they dont hustle they dont care theyre taking the bread out of my childrens mouths never mind that they are also leading the team in hitting that only makes it worse that only shows how good they could be if they cared there is some truth here too the latin temperament is quite different than the american temperament people who grow up in latinamerican countriesbe they white or coloredhave never been noted for their energy there is first of all that enervating tropical climate which slows down the entire pace of life we dont see ourselves as others see us we dont even begin to appreciate that our whole attitude toward life has been formed by that remarkable institution the american dream which tells us that there is nothing we cannot do nothing we cannot be if we will educate ourselves work hard and think clean thoughts we are a nation of optimists the american player whom we call a hustler is just the standard american gogetter transported to the baseball field we are also a people who think in terms of the longrun because we have been granted the luxury of a stable government we are so sure that the framework that exists today will be there always that it does not even enter our calculations the latin american has no such history of political stability his thinking formed just as unconsciously by his own background is for the shortrun the latinamerican player wants to be successful sure but he does not really think in terms of being a big success the drive to keep pushing himself to rise higher and higher just hasnt been built into the marrow of his bones he is more apt to wonder why these crazy americans dont relax and take a siesta now and then instead of rushing around all the time going nowhere the criticism of the latinamerican player really adds up to the ageold cry theyre not like us and they are not the difference in temperament could hardly be wider in all of these differences and all of these conflicts as they apply to both the negro and the latin american there is one constant they have not a thing to do with basic intelligence there are some people who fear that the negro will soon dominate the major leagues i take this as a compliment to baseball because it shows that everyone understands that ball clubs will play the best men available in every position regardless of colorand regardless of any talk about conflicts of temperament i for one dont think its going to happen i think that as other fields open up for the negro a drainingotf process will set in besides as the negro becomes more sophisticated more successful more middleclass he will become less physical he will sit at an office desk drive to the corner for his newspaper and be privileged to enjoy the rich food we could all do so nicely without the debilitating process will have begun welcome to the affluent society a report black arts convention by dudley randall he first black arts convention sponsored by forum met in detroit june at central united church of christ it went beyond the arts for in addition to randall workshops on literature music art and the drama there were workshops on education religion negro history and politics an estimated persons attended the threeday sessions coming from most of the major cities across the nation stokely carmichael new executive director of sncc was injured in a demonstration and was unable to give the opening address charles p howard took his place and read a message from carmichael which expressed the hope that when one black man gets hurt every black man will move against those who hurt him howard said that the u s propaganda in africa against leaders like nasser sukarno and toure is fantastic he urged negroes to support and sacrifice for our militant leaders we must have nkrumah back he said max stanford said the black male has no power is a faggot the black man can only become a man through a revolution by any means possible he cited atrocities against negroes there should be a program for group action negroes must unite and organize the panel on literature stressed that the black writer should not write for the approval of a white audience but to the needs and aspirations of his people lawrence p neal said this will not be limiting for the range of black experience was broader than the range of western experience and included love wonder excitement rhobena nelson urged that writers know their own history and oliver lagrone and bobb hamilton said they must teach the beauty of blackness harold foster said that writers must open the eyes of the people to the ugliness around them and spur them to action dudley randall said that the seeming disadvantages of black writers were in reality opportunities because since they had less chance of being corrupted or distracted by success they could devote themselves to the solitary labor of writing they should develop their own media and publishing houses in the panel on religion the view was expressed that god is not dead but only old notions of god and of the singleness of god one member said negroes dont need whiteys theology and ridiculed the stories of the creation and of jesuss birth a speaker from the floor called christianity the most damaging of all religions it broke the people fitted them to be slaves milton henry said we cannot throw out the scriptures especially the old testament even though paul had perverted them with his admonition slaves be obedient to your masters in the workshop on negritude and afroamerican history harold lawrence outlined the contributions of negroes like isaiah mccoy to american technology martha prescott said that history is a tool of culture we can use it not only to set the record straight but to understand the process of deculturization that took place years ago k william kgositsile a south african said it doesnt matter how much black history you know if you dont use it senegal is still a french colony confrontation of africa with the west is inevitable what will the black artist do to orientate the black psyche it is a question of survival he said leopold senghor initiated negritude because he realized no matter how french the senegalese were to the french the were still niggers the motels hotels and banks are still french the negroes there are like niggers on plantations jackie wilson a member of forum read a paper on black nationalism that said black essence is still to be born he proposed an institute for africanamerican studies here or in harlem to know this beast and fight him in the halls of the university of chicago harvard and the university of california in the drama panel david rambeau gave a short history of detroits concept east theater he said they had been not talking but doing at concept east the black actor can learn the elements of acting without the humiliation of being patronized by whites denise nicholas said one of the biggest problems of the free southern theater is material blacks have been writing plays but few have been produced there are few black actors and technicians another problem is the lack of images and symbols for black people most plays deal with one or two whites and the natives except for a few plays by leroi jones and one or two others sylvia king spoke of the need for black writers and producers we need people to invest their money in productions she was baf fled by whether to play negro roles or roles of just any mother wife i doctor or lawyer lawrence p neal asked who we were trying to reach what do we want to say mrs kings individual problems are not important shakespeare the russian and the french dramatists knew they were writing for englishmen russians frenchmen negroes alone have to ask themselves whom they are writing for he criticized rambeau for i producing waiting for godot a play which has nothing at all to do with black people it doesnt matter that youve been not talking but doing it matters what youre doing we need not just a theater of anger and protest but of love spirituality there are plays in the schomburg collection by afroamericans which are out of print and available for production rambeau replied that all have their humanity no one can give it or take it away when you talk about whitey you have lost your humanity when you get into talk about aesthetics you dont get action people starve not from whitey but because you have talked them to death concept east has done the toilet the slave dutchman blues for mr charlie and plays by local authors neal replied that rambeau still hadnt answered why he produced godot he asked who controls concept east who pays costs who selects roles because our people have been lulled into a zombielike state of complacency we need the spectrum of emotions including hate mentioning whitey doesnt lessen humanity we can have a dialogue as brothers and sisters an elderly man in the audience said we dont hate white people we hate hate weve been beat robbed killed in this country and were going to love it if thats love damn it denise nicholas wanted some way to pool resources so ideas could spread across the country neal suggested that concept east the three new york theaters and other theaters form a national black theater and meet on pooling resources in the workshop on politics grace boggs suggested that citizens organize on small grievances until they could take power a member of the black citizens council of watts made the only derogatory remark about malcolm_x when he said there were three kinds of black nationaliststhe talking kind and he showed a picture of malcolm eloquent and logical but doing nothing the ram kind who are suspicious of everybody and the action kind and he showed a picture of a watts youth saying burn baby burn another speaker said that where the blacks live they should have control leaders should take orders from the black community the party could have any name but should have black officers and be controlled by the black community the prime minister of the harlem peoples parliament in new york said it was the goal of a nation to establish a government therefore they had chosen the yoruba culture and had established a government in harlem he had appointed ministers in fields of their interest and accomplishment the minister of education has set up a curriculum from grade to grade if this curriculum is not started in the schools in september they will padlock the schools on liberation day may they will stop paying rent women will take over the lofts and start light industries sunday novelist john oliver killens delivered the closing address in which he said that the negro was an anglosaxon invention to make black men undeserving of human treatment to deniggerize to rid the world of niggers is the job of the black revolution in this struggle minds are enslaved with words and words must free our minds killens said in this struggle love is irrelevant a master cant love his slave and a slave cant love his master unless he is a fool we must know the profound beauty of broad noses thick lips we must create our own myths our own legends we must consolidate our power in cities and take power places where negroes live dont have to be ghettos we must stop wasting too much ammunition on each other the convention as a whole had the fervency of a religious revival there were the icons of the saints marcus garvey w e b du bois paul robeson malcolm_x there were the shouts of amen tell it brother and applause and standing ovations for malcolm_xs widow and poetry reader val gray the artists musicians and writers were there but conspicuous by their absence were the local leaders except those of the freedom now party yet underneath the fervency there was a certain wistfulness these desires to control their own destiny to produce their own art to defend themselves from attack which kept the local bigwigs away in droves are after all nothing alarming nothing radical these are rights which should be taken for granted without even having to be talked about these plans for political power are the same as those discussed by the republican and the prohibition parties or by jews italians or poles all through the ages all over the world it has been mans right to defend his life and person what made the wistfulness is that it was necessary to have such a convention at all the wall by gloria davis lba stood before his father waiting for his answer and clenching his fists hopefully his father bit his full top lip and turned his eyes away avoiding him alba could feel the wall rising between them the wall which always seemed to rise from nowhere suddenly he wanted to cry out but the memory that he was no longer a small boy stopped his tears the dirt which made the floor felt sticky under his bare feet he dropped his hands and walked through the huge hole which made a door onto the rocky pathway the morning air stuck in his nostrils and the cool earth soothed the soles of his hot feet he walked past the rundown shacks until he found a deserted spot he took a deep breath and looked around suddenly he thought about nee her silky skin and flashing smile her thick full lips and broad nose everyone said she was beautiful he had only recently met her but already he had decided that she would be his wife many other boys of the village had wanted her but he had gotten her his chest swelled with pride at the thought nee was not the only reason he wanted to go to the south to work in the mines he wanted nice things and there was no work here that could pay for them he wanted a fine house like he saw in the magazines he wanted rugs so deep that his feet could get lost in them and beautiful furniture he wanted to work a full year before getting married then he would be seventeen he had known that he needed money to go south but he thought it would prove to be no problem he had told his father of his plans fine good he had said nee will make a good wife and give you many sons he had said fine to everything until he heard about the mines how come you cant stay here and work he had yelled mf j ml m alba had explained the reason to him over and over finally he had given up and left his father to turn the idea over in his head again hoping he would change his mind he had asked two more times but had gotten no reply he couldnt understand it his father had once lived in the south he turned and started home where you been boy his father demanded out he replied you mad at me yeah how come how come you wont gimme no money to go south alba spat how come you dont want me to work in the mines he added yelling alba looked at his father he saw his eyes waver and the wall rise between them again sit and eat the food it is hot now his father said pointing to the table alba pulled a box across the earthmade floor he picked up a chipped dish and dipped stew from the black pot they were eating in silence until his papa said aint you changed your mind yet boy naw alba replied maybe you should talk to nee maybe she could help you change your mind no why not because i am a man and a man needs no woman to help him make important decisions you once told me that it is important for a man to make the decisions why are you changing now im not changing you have yet to become a man you are a small boy with boyish dreams you are a boy who needs help to make important decisions i am a man i have the dreams of a man i do not want to wither and die old like you with nothing alba gestured excitedly eating the same food day in and day out from chipped bowls and black pots he was immediately sorry for the way he had spoken he could see that his father had been hurt by the way his face crumbled if you were a man i would hit you but you are yet a child and you do not know the real treasures of life like a child you let your tongue wag loosely and your words spill freely the old man slowly rose from the table and walked away alba sat at the table and thought about what his father had said still he denied that he was a child and that his words spilled freely and his tongue wagged loosely he knew that he would never get the money from his father he had torn at the wall which stood before him with strong urgent hands he had beat it with forceful fists and kicked it with hot sweating feet but it had not budged it still stood immovable laughing at him for he could never tear it down to see what lay behind it he knew what he would do he would have to work secretly to get the money if he could just work tomorrow he would have almost enough and he could get the rest from nee this would be adequate to get him there he would worry about the rest when the time came with his plan in his mind he moved the chipped bowls off the table and washed them alba strolled out into the next mornings air to look for a job he went from place to place looking hungrily for work finally a man hired him the job paid less than he had hoped but he took it anyway he arose each morning after to go to work returned late in the day and had dinner from the cracked bowls with his father he had made up his mind he now planned on a day of leaving before he left he would go by nees as he did many evenings now but he would say goodbye e in the middle of dinner that evening his father rose and left the table in a minute he came back and thrust the money on the table howd you get that money steal it alba felt guilty only for a moment naw i worked for it why i needed it so i could go south he saw a shadow creep into his fathers eyes and the wall was between them again but this time the shadow began to fade and the wall began to crumble you say you do not want to wither and die old like me with nothing if you go to the mines you will grow old and die with not even this he waved his hands futilely you will work hard and soon spit blood it is a slow dying you will do boy what of your family will they be like mine my papa worked in the mines too and he soon coughed blood and died he left his sons and wife alone to work he did not have even this he gestured again is it not better to live and have nothing than to work and die with nothing the unanswered question hung in the air the money lay on the table alba went to nees my father my bottom my fleas by ethridge knight kentucky summer y t ip y was hot and the levee cut off what little breeze there was the river was down the bottom was closing in on me although i had been feeling him out for a long time i dont think i i i would have ever gotten up enough courage to do it if it had not been for the busted lip bring it out in the opentonight i told myself as i stood in the bathroom silently pressing a cold cloth to my mouth it didnt matter that i had had my mouth busted by him maybe a hundred times before or that i knew such accidents were unavoidable while body punchingespecially when our bodies were slick with sweat and we were caught up in the heat of battle before supper he had come out alongside the backyard fence where i was digging baitworm beginning the ritual he had stripped off his shirt and said wanna go a coupla rounds sport i had dropped my spade and completed the ceremonyas i had done for as long as i can remember yessir a coupla rounds if you want to i stripped off my shirt and we squared off during the workout he got carried away and one of his punches had glanced off my shoulder splitting my lip ignoring his are you hurt sport huh are you hurt i had shaken off the gloves and struck out for the bathroom spitting out blood along the way for awhile he had hung around outside the bathroom door sucking air through his teeth well i would also use his regret to help press my case tonight after supper for a half hour he hunched over my shoulder while i did his weekly bookkeeping in the livingroom it was friday payday and i figured out the hours he had worked the grocery bill the house rent and everything with his overtime and all things were not so bad he slapped me on the back then turned and went in the kitchen where mama and tina my tenyearold sister were doing the dishes he got himself a can of beer and came back in the livingroom easing into his chair by the radio i waited until he had finished listening to gabriel heatter and the news then i walked up to him took a deep breath and plunged in daddy yeah sport daddy clovis perkins and frank hughes and oliver cobb and fred polk and everybody are going down to take their army physicals monday morning i couldnt see his face because he leaned over the radio and began twisting the dial i took a step closer and continued ill probably be sent close byto fort knox maybe and ill be able to come home sometimes on weekends and since ill be seventeen soon anyway you really wouldnt be lying if you signed the papers and the recruiting officer said he snapped the radio off and faced me leaning forward he dropped his chin on his chest and stared up at me from under his lumpy scartissued eyebrows i saw two deep furrows cut across his jetblack brow and i got a little nervous then he began slowly weaving his head from side to side as if he were slipping punches and said what you bob talking bout sport sign what weave papers you aint seventeen bob like them others you weave sixteen whered you get this foolishness from you aint going to no bob army this fall you going back to weave school he glared at me for a second then turned back to the radio fingering the dial even though i had expected that bobbingandweaving bit i couldnt help hesitating id seen that same trick send bill collectors scurrying when he was out of work and didnt have money to pay his debts it had worked on tina and me often when wed try to wheedle a buck out of him for a movie or something id seen it work on mama even like when shed jump on him for sitting in the front yard in his undershirt shed usually wind up massaging his shoulders or something but there have been times the trick didnt work like the time mrs woodson a big woman with big big breast who was tinas music teacher came one night to our house and told him that he was going to have to buy a piano for tina that really hit him he shuffled around the living room snorting and shadowboxing like he was in madison square garden the battle raged for hours but he couldnt hold out against the barrage of tears pleas and cutting words loosed by mama mrs woodson and tina i even took their side and got in a few good licks before he finally said okay okay ill see about getting the damn thing tomorrow so i wasnt about to let that bobbing and weaving trick work on me now i folded my arms across my chest and said look daddy i might as well go now in a year or so ill have to go anyway i mean the war might last til fortyeight or fortyninesome people say so why wait you gotta stay in school sport wait a little while besides he said softly whos gonna do my figuring for me if you leave that caught me below the belt i turned and walked over to the sofa and flopped on it collecting my composure i knew that he was very proud of and slightly amazed by my ability with numbers many times i remembered in the evenings hed be sitting in the front yard with mr murray one of his old boxing buddies and hed call me out and have me trying to explain algebra and geometry to them i had a notion to ask him whod done his bookkeeping before id learned how but i didnt i decided to compromise well look daddy suppose i dont go to the army suppose i just go off somewhere and get a job at least for the rest of the summer and ill be back home in time for school just when i thought i had him seeing things my way he suddenly changed styles on me he shifted to mama who with tina had slipped against the wall listening to the whole thing whats the matter with this damn fool boy he said to her he gone crazy you better talk to him i felt cheated and fouled whats she got to do with it i shouted jumping up from the sofa this is between you and me whats so crazy about it anyway you yourself have told me a thousand times that you left home dur mg the first world war and you were only fifteen thats different things was different then they better now he shoved up from his chair strode across the room and began his bobbing and weaving bit again you aint going bob nowheres get it out of your weave head tomorrow im going downtown to that recruiting office and tell the man bob myself i faced him squarely i dont pare what you do im getting out of this stupid place i saw the vein swelling and wiggling like a fishing worm in his temple and i knew that i should shut up but the words popped out of my mouth im not going to stay in this stupid old town and become a stupid old man i saw the blur his open palm whipped up smacking against my ear i leaped backwards and fell into a crouch with my guard up he took a step toward me his eyes were flaming slits his left hand hung at his side and his right hand was raised above his head he was wide open then i saw his hand swooping down and my mind screamed catchit with your left and countercounter throw your rightyour right but i couldnt move a muscle my chest hurt my ears roared tears welled in my eyes again his hand lifted from far away i heard mama moan and tina whimper and i moved i slipped under his swing and scooted for the door there i paused fighting down the hurlyburly in my brain and threw what i figured was my toughest look in his direction i think i saw him wipe his eyes with the back of his hand but im not sure i crawled into bed and pulled the covers over my head with my ears ringing with the image of his slitted eyes and uplifted hand dancing behind my eyelids and with the desire to clear out bubbling through my blood i twisted and fretted for hours the next morning the taste of the fight was still in my mouth and the whirlwind was still in my head for a moment i lay on the twisted sheets soaking in the morning sounds trying to locate daddy in the living room tina was tinkling on the piano from the basement came the slushlunkaslushlunka of mamas washing machine outside a big semitrailer growled down highway past the back of our house where they coughed and grinded gears for the long pull up and over the ohio river bridge and droned away into illinois not hearing daddys heavy footsteps around the house i guessed that he had gone downtown to pay the saturday billsand to see the recruiting officer groaning inwardly i rolled out of bed washed and dressed i examined my busted lip in the mirror and my chest tightened i wheeled and went into the kitchen where i sat down at the table picked up a cold sweet potato peeled it and bit viciously into the soft yellow meat i heard mama moving around in the basement and i glanced at the basement door in my mind i could see her shoving clothes through the wringer her eyes large and luminous her skin smooth like chocolate with tiny buds of perspiration glistening on the tip of her nose and curling the edges of her hair i half rose to go to her then i sat back down thinking of another time when she had looked at me funnylike and said but sport try to understand hes my man she had aired my mattress that particular day and had found under it certain cheaply printed highly illustrative pamphlets and some peacock prophylactics and when i had come from school the pamphlets and prophylactics were laid neatly wrapped in brown paper in the center of my bed at supper i couldnt meet her eyes but all evening i swaggered around the house prepared for and welcoming an outburst from daddy the outburst never came and when it became obvious that she hadnt told him i felt strangely let down later after asking her why she hadnt told him and after her answering hes my man i felt ashamed and angry i finished eating the sweet potato and stood up looking at the basement door she would be thinking about last night i was ashamed she would think i wanted her to intercede i was angry i picked up another sweet potato and slipped out the back door heading for the river and mr frank clayton paige i climbed the grasscovered levee which separated the river from the bottom the neighborhood where i lived the levee was the community park for the bottom it was here on hot summer eveningsin spite of the stinging mosquitosthat the old folks sat the children played and the guys rambled with the girls catching the cool breeze blowing off the river it was here a few nights ago that i had kissed cathy cathy with the chinese eyes and quick smile i had kissed her and kissed her fumbling with her blouse and she had let my hand rest on her small tense breast i shoved my hands in my pockets and stopped thinking about going past cathys house then i spotted mr frank clayton paige tramping out of his shack he squatted beside the river bank and began to haul in his night lines i trotted down the river side of the levee scrambled through the willows and bushes and in a couple of minutes i was squatting beside mr frank clayton paige he looked over at me and nodded half smiling i nodded back and dragged his doughbucket in front of me keeping quiet i began to roll the soft lumpy dough into smooth balls of doughbait it was hard to tell about mr frank clayton paige sometimes he didnt like to talk early in the morning mr frank clayton paige was a white man with thick hair brown like cured tobacco leaves in the summer it turned reddish like the streaks in the river when the sun went down he was tall almost as tall as daddy but not nearly as thick and he had funny eyes that changed colors like the river did some of the bottom folks said that mr frank clayton paige was rich and that he had lost his wife and children in the flood of but all i know for sure about him is that after the flood he showed up one day built himself a tarpaper shack on the river bank threw out his lines and commenced to fish he never talked about himself and i for one never asked him the old folks avoided him somewhat but clovis perkins oliver cobb fred polk and i hung around his shack all the time even if he didnt talk much he would always listen to us guys listen with a tiny shine way back in his eyes funny ive seen him look at the river the very same way mr frank clayton paige unhooked the few shimmering fish then he said aint you going to your car wash job today sport uhuh i quit i began to rebait the hooks letting the cold wet lines slide across my palm mr frank clayton paige didnt remark he walked a piece down the bank and threw a line hissing out over the water i called down to him you know clovis perkins and oliver cobb and everybody are going to the army monday dont you yeah they told me i got to my feet and blurted out well i asked daddy to sign some papers so i could go too and he wouldnt do it and we had a fight and so im gonna leave im going somewhere mr frank clayton paige looked at me and grunted and i felt foolish after a bit he said where you figuring on going i dont know yetmaybe new orleans maybe chicago got any money sixteen dollars umm aint too much what with the war prices and all nossir but ill make outill make out well he said dismissing the conversation with a shrug lets have a slug of coffee once more i felt foolish and a little disappointed i followed mr frank clayton paige to his shack resolving not to bring the subject up again i drank the coffee silently and afterward with two fishing poles in my hands i walked back to the river the sun was high by now throwing sparkles in the water and spreading a warm blanket everywhere i set out my fishing poles and lazed about on the soft grass gazing up at the patches of cotton floating in the washed blue sky flies and snakedoctors buzzed and flitted around i drowsed a barge carrying scrapiron glided by sending waves laplapping against the bank i slept when i woke the afternoon was deep and i was hungry the sun had fallen behind the bridge which stood humped like the skeleton of a giant dinosaur some of the bottom folks through with their days work were strung out along the bank the mosquitoes and crickets had started their racket and bullbats were darting through the air snapping up gnats i lifted my hooks which had been nibbled clean out of the water and looked around for mr frank clayton paige he was fishing away from the bottom folks on a sandy knoll that jutted out into the river i stood for a moment looking at him then casting off my resolution i leaned the fishing poles against his shack and went over he looked up with that funny shine in his eyes well mr frank clayton paige i said i dont guess ill be seeing you anymore he stuck out his hand gimme a lift i grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet still set on going huh sport he said i nodded yes come on down to the place for a minute he wheeled toward his shack and somewhat reluctantly i followed inside the dim fishy shack mr frank clayton paige rummaged through some cardboard boxes then he straightened up and turned holding in his hand a long wallet like the kind semitrailer drivers carry understand me clear sport he said i think youre wrong in leaving home i think you had better listen to your daddy but every dogs gotta scratch his own fleas he stuck his hand in the wallet and counted out some bills here take thisin case you might want to come back to your daddy and to your river though i was surprised i didnt argue i took the money and stood like an idiot counting it one hundred dollars mr frank clayton its okay sport just remember wherever you go to scratch your own fleas i opened my mouth to say something again but he made a shooing motion with his hand his eyes were shining in the dimness and he turned back to the cardboard boxes i threw up my hand at him stepped out of the shack and headed for the levee smiling i had no worries now with a hundred bucks i could go to the north pole i need not even go home for my few clothes i would simply follow the levee on around to town board a bus and be on my way topping the levee i stopped for one final look at the bottom i inspected it i gazed at it with my eyes i devoured it turning it upside down and inside out it rested twisted and listless like a fat snake squeezed between the levee on this side and highway on the other the frame houses mostly unpainted faced the levee as if they were snubbing the highway and the town beyond black stove pipes jutting crookedly out of the patched tin roofs oozed wisps of smoke from the supper fires and the smoke hovering in the still air formed a haze that was tinted copper by the now dead sun young ones played quietly in the packed dirt yards waiting to be called in to supper but every now and then one of them would send a shriek slicing through the air i could see aunt mandy who used to tell me ghost stories sitting on her front steps over there was clovis perkins leaning his bike against the fence and there was mr buchanan turning off the highway in his old chevy i tried to spot cathy maybe prancing out to pump some water yonder was florence with her baby poochie whose daddyeverybody said was a white man i tried not to look at our house but when i saw tina shoot out from behind some houses racing toward mrs jacksons i couldnt help but look i didnt see him sitting in the front yard probably hulked in the living room with his ear glued to the radio probably waiting for his coupla rounds sport no sir not tonight sir thank you sir not ever again i rose to go beyond the bottom saw the towns lights glowing in the dusk and i fancied that i could see the blue dog flashing on and off above the bus station then i saw tina again she dashed out of mrs jacksons house and flew down the dusty street she disappeared behind some more houses then reappeared a few minutes later at aunt mandys gate shouting something aunt mandy got up and hurried out the gate toward our house with tina pulling at her hand i saw mama come out on the porch and look toward aunt mandys i turned and took off for town no sir not tonight sir so what if mrs jackson did own one of the three telephones in the bottom and aunt mandy comes to our house all the time tina is just being silly i quickened my steps jamming my hands in my pockets feeling the hundred dollars no sir thank you sir never again sir so what if mrs jacksons phone is used for emergencies hes never been sick in his life he stays in shape not an ounce of fat on him wanna go a coupla rounds sport whos gonna do my figuring i stopped and looked back at our house i could see figures bustling through the rooms but not his big frame all at once i started trotting veering down the bottom side of the levee no sir thank you sir not tonight sir you got to scratch your own fleas sir and i got to scratch my from way across the bottom i heard a siren and i felt like upchucking no sir thank you sir not tonight sir when i hit level ground i broke into a dead run heading for home cotton alley by pearl crayton alley aint the x r right kind of name for a stretch where folk live a person hates to tell anybody his address is on a street with that name it just sounds too common most folk who hear the word alley think of something cheap and nobody wants folk to think he lives in a cheap place even if he does a persons got to have some pride somewhere about him but its hard to have any living in a place called cotton alley thats the way we were all of us who lived on cotton alleya bunch of black folk living in a quarter of dingy little shotgun houses far enough away from the better part of town some trying hard to have a little pride and too many not trying at all mister sam was one of those who didnt try and when he did take a notion to he paid a big price for it cotton alley and what we who lived there were to the rest of the world and one policeman got all tangled up together one saturday evening and did something bad to mister samhurt him real bad but hes out of it now it hurt me too and its still hurting me things are better for my people now were free to go anywhere we want to go and do any kind of work were smart enough to do so its best to forget about all the troubles weve been through and work together to do something for our country like president kennedy said we should do anybody with a dimes worth of sense can see that this is the best thing to do aint nobody got any business going around crying about something that happened twentynine years ago yet every now and then that old nightmare memory from those days before the war rise up in my mind and i cry there just aint no sense in me troubling my mind about what happened to mister sam i want to forget lord knows ive tried to forget but i cant mister sam wasnt any kin to me and i didnt care a cent about him he just wasnt the kind of man folk take a liking to every saturday after he got his paycheck hed stop by the honkytonk and drink too much wine then hed come home and fight miss peewee his commonlaw wife and their little girl lucy mae would stand on their porch and cry sometimes when mister sam got the best of miss peewee shed run off up to mister mose johnsons house and call the police theyd come and take mister sam to jail and call up his bossman whod tell them to turn mister sam aloose and in about an hour hed come home and eat supper he was just another one of the bad things we had to put up with on cotton alley all the churchgoing folk kept away from mister sam on account of his drinking and all the sporting folk kept away from him on account of he worked on the garbage truck and didnt ever smell right besides that he couldnt read or write and some folk claimed he had fits there could have been plenty of folk living on cotton alley who liked mister sam but didnt any of them ever show it while i was around i didnt make pretend i liked him either i got a bigger kick out of poking fun at how bad he smelled then one saturday evening came when he stood up in the yard behind the house where he lived swinging an old halfrotten plank at two policemen panting and hollering ah aint gonna let yall hit me on mah head wit dat blackjack again white folk and his bad smell didnt seem funny to me anymore mister sam looked too much all by himself standing there with nothing but that policemans triggerfinger between him and death but the funny thing was that he didnt look any different to me than he had looked every day that id seen him hed always been that much all by himself i just hadnt paid any attention to it until that evening blood was running from a cut on the side of mister sams head getting mixed up with his sweat every now and then hed wipe that side of his face on his shoulder real quick not slowing down the swing of the plank as he did so that was too hot a day for anybody to be getting all worked up like he was doing the sun was going down but it had been so hot all day that the heat of it was still in the ground and in the wood of the houses and in the old tin cans and bottles and slopjars laying around in the back yard all that heat brought out the smell of everything in that back yard that didnt smell goodthe two old toilets that everybody on the block used but nobody cleaned the sloppy place under the water faucet that always dripped the old rusty zinc tubs of garbage with flies singing over them the wet places around the back doors of the houses where the women threw their dish water the big bunch of folk who were standing around looking at mister sam and the policemen made it seem hotter there were too many of them and they were too quiet everything was too quietwhich made what mister sam and the policemen said sound louder than was natural now you drop that plank boy now you drop that plank right now one policeman was saying in a lazysounding hillbilly drawl holding his pistol on mister sam with one hand and holding out the other hand like he was looking for mister sam to stop swinging the plank and give it to him hed said those same words more times than he had fingers and toes and mister sam was still swinging the plank at him aw mike youre playing with that nigger the other policeman who had come in the black car said come on lets take that plank from this nigger and take him in its getting close to supper time im hungry he was standing off to the side with both hands on his hips looking real sassy his face all frowned up like hed been smelling that back yard too long lucy mae was standing on their back steps crying and calling daddy daddy daddy daddy calling mister sam like she had something to tell him but he didnt pay any attention to her what happened somebody who came up behind me asked in a whisper sam did some sassy talking to them laws n one of em hit im over th head n he runned back here n started acting a fool someone whispered back i wanted to say that aint the way it happened but when i turned my head and saw that it was miss viney whod done the answering i knew better than dispute her word miss viney was the best shouter at our church a loudly professed soldier in the army of the lord who went around fighting sin right and left and she was overaverage good at bringing punishment upon children who sassed grown folk i held back what i wanted to say but holding it made me feel bad inside now when i remember how it was i wish that i had turned around and said to miss viney i saw the whole thing i was standing by mister sams porch when those policemen came to arrest him and i heard every word they said that policeman standing over there with his hands on his hips called mister sam a nigger and mister sam told him don call me no nigger capn cause ah aint no nigger ise a merican man jes like you is thats all he said and that little old sassylooking policeman hit him over the head with his blackjack looking back i dont see how i could have been so scared of a whipping that i wouldnt speak up for mister sam now you listen to me boy im getting tired of fooling around with you the policeman called mike said in a voice that was too lazy to sound mean he didnt act like he was in a great big hurry to take mister sam to jailmaybe because he knew it wouldnt do any good he had come and arrested mister sam plenty of times before and hed always had to come back and do it again in a couple of weeks boy dont you know that old plank you have there aint no match for this here pistol besides theres two of us you cant whip us both by yourself dont you know that now you stop this foolishness and put that plank down he was trying to talk some sense into mister sams head and maybe wait until his arms got tired from swinging that plank ef ah throw way mah pre teckshun yall gonna beat me up wit dem blackjacks capn mister sam said panting like a tired dog but still swinging the plank ef yall promise me yall aint gonna beat me up wit dem blackjacks ahll put dis plank down it seemed like mister sam wanted to put the plank down but he had went and made a big show of standing up for himself in front of all of us so he didnt want to give in without getting the policemen to give in a little too he must have had a notion to try to pretend he had some pride the policeman called mike didnt answer right off like he was making up his mind about what kind of answer to give mister sam right away i crossed my fingers and closed my eyes and started to wish real hard that hed promise like mister sam asked because mister sam was trying to have a little pride for the first time in his life and he should let him have his pride he was ugly and black and he didnt have much sense but he was an american and an american had a right to have some pride but before i got the wish straight in my mind that little old sassy looking policeman was hollering aw no mike no promises we cant make any promises at all no i opened my eyes and saw him waving his hands and shaking his head like he was trying to head off somebody from walking into a wasp nest i took a quick look at the other policemans face and at mister sams face and they both looked letdown they had their eyes on that little sassy looking policeman didnt either of them seem to know what to do next it seemed to me they were looking for him to tell them and that put him in charge a cold and ugly something moved up behind me id been around it enough before to know that it was just old scared creeping up on me i wanted to walk off so i wouldnt see what i was scared i was going to see but i stood there and watched mister sam pay the full price for his pride a feeling inside of me held me there an ugly feeling that had come on me a long long time before way back when i first found out that there was more than one color of folk in the world and i was of the color that didnt fare so well the color that all other colors looked down on i had pushed this feeling to the back of my mind because in church our preacher claimed that god loved black folk j as much as he loved white folk and in school our teacher claimed that everybody born in our country were americans and all americans were equal by our countrys laws so all the while i was in church or school i could keep that feeling in the back of my mind but every time i saw a bus driver make a person my color go sit in the back of the bus or i had to drink water from a fountain marked for my color or i had to sit upthesteps in the picture show where everybody my color had to sit or i passed by city park and saw children other colors playing on ground i couldnt walk on and swinging in swings i couldnt touch or i wanted to go any place folk my color werent allowed to go or i heard somebody call a person my color nigger that old feeling rubbed inside of me it was rubbing me then hurting my belief that what my preacher and teacher said was right hurting me all over if we make a promise to this here nigger all these other niggers standing around here are gonna go all over town bragging about how he got the best of us and after that every time one of us go and try to arrest a nigger hell grab up a stick and make us promise him something aw mike you dont know these niggers you give them an inch and theyll take a mile youve got to handle a nigger like hes a nigger and hell stay in his place now you watch me ill show you how to handle a nigger that little old sassy looking policeman started moving towards mister sam real slowly with both his hands held up as high as his shoulders you see i dont have anything in my hands he said to mister sam im coming take that plank away from you then he looked over his shoulder and said to us standing around you all see i dont have anything in my hands now do i do i have anything in my hands he stood dead still waiting for one of us to answer it was plain that he wanted one of us to agree with him so that wed be on his side against mister sam he had all the rest of the world on his side it didnt make sense for him to want us too us and him and his guns and all the world against mister sam was just too much all my insides wanted to holler out somebody ought to be on mister sams side but my throat was too choked up with being scared for the sound to come out my eyes jumped from one face to the other of the folk standing around in the back yards looking for somebody to say something or do something to help mister sam it seemed to me that while that policeman was standing still waiting for one of us to answer him somebody standing around there could say something to mister sam to get him to throw down that plank and save himself maybe all he needed was for one of us to say something to him but i just didnt know who would do the saying my daddy was standing over by the corner of our house still dressed in the coveralls he worked in at the sawmill it just happened that when my eyes jumped to him he was looking at me and i thought at him with all my heart and soul say something to help mister sam daddy but either he didnt get it or he got it and didnt know what to say or he was scared to say anything because he dropped his head and got all wrapped up in an old tin can that was laying by his foot he kicked it and watched it roll off to the edge of the grass then he kicked what maybe was a rock on the ground maybe it was just the ground he kicked he didnt look at me anymore right then i knew that i needed to be all grown up so that i could say something to make that policeman understand that mister sam was an american man just like hed m told him he was and he had a right to stand up and tell folk to not call him a nigger because he was an american man i needed to be grown up so that i could do something to stop the bad thing i was scared was going to happen so that i could help myself hold on to believing that mister sam and all of us black folk were americans because that was all the pride i had do i have anything in my hands the policeman was asking no suh you shore dont miss vineys voice came from behind me everybody turned and looked at her with the kind of looks that went with cussing but didnt anybody say anything my hands went into fists all by themselves but i knew that i couldnt let them hit her very slowly i made my fingers uncurl holding back being mad hurting my insides holding it back all right nigger im coming to take that plank from you with my bare hands the policeman said moving slowly towards mister sam again you can act a fool and hit me if you want to if youre fool enough to hit a policeman youre the biggest fool in town don come up on me capn mister sam said backing back so scared his eyes were bucked as big as saucers don come up on me ah say the policeman reached out his hand real quick to grab the plank and it hit his hand he jumped clean off the ground and hollered like hed been shot grabbing the hit hand with his other one and shaking them above his head he really clowned for a while he hollered so loud that i could hardly hear the shot from the other policemans pistol mister sam was laying on the ground with his head in the sloppy place under the water faucet and his feet kicking up dust then all of a sudden he was too still the policeman called mike went to him and squatted beside him he took mister sams hand in his and held it for a long time feeling on his wrist then he laid one of his ears on mister sams chest and let it lay there for a long time listening he raised his hand for us to be quiet even though nobody was saying anythingwasnt either one of us hardly breathing he turned his head and laid his other ear on mister sams chest and listened so long that i wanted to holler cant you see hes dead after a while he looked up at all of us standing around turning his head slowly from one side to the other looking at us all his breath moving his chest coming out of him his face looking like hed come upon something he didnt want to believe and he was looking for somebody to tell him it wasnt so then his eyes got to lucy mae and he couldnt turn them away she was still standing on their back steps crying and calling mister sam calling his name louder and faster daddy daddy daddy daddy screaming his name somebody went to lucy mae and took her inside the house and got her quieted down but i could still hear her crying the sound of me everytime i pass by a street it was too sad for me i ran away named alley and see a bunch of from that sound but it followed me folk my color living in dingy little i had run a long long ways before houses not fit for poodles i can it came to me that the sound was see mister sam again buying a litcoming from inside of me it was tie pride with his life and i just my own crying its still inside of cant keep from crying
and l rights by donald r hopkins here are i would say two elements of sadness in the present controversy being waged within the civil_rights movement it is very sad to see the traditional civil_rights movement dying in the inglorious man ner that it is and it is sad to see the new philosophy of the black ghetto being born in the inauspicious manner that it is ideally both events being patently inevitable would have occurred with so little fanfare that this country would have been reaping the ineluctable benefits of the new black selfconsciousness even before it realized that something dramatically new and exciting had been wrought in its midst unfortunately and perhaps to its ultimate damnation such is not the way of race relations in the united states where new myths and old realities lack even the tinny grandeur one finds in its international politics it is possible to look at americas attitude toward say the war in vietnam without feeling quite so nauseated as one feels in searching her attitudes toward black_power or any other philosophical position the black american may assume which is to the slightest degree at variance with the sacred attitudes of the white liberal establishment this is so because the impulse to war the avarice and arrogance of international power politics can be made out to appear more rational mistakes may be made in calculating the will to resist of a given people relationships become artificially structured and the course of human events takes on an internal logical cohesiveness to which the desires of individual human beings and nations become subordinate if white america has even this threshold control over its attitudes toward black america it is nowhere apparent one is reminded of a period a few years back when the popularity of malcolm_x and the publication of c eric lincolns book the black muslims in america made it appear that the muslims were threatening to set the tone of racial activities in the northern urban negro communities at this time there went out a great hue and cry from liberal whites and from the predictable dependable black bourgeoisie decrying the racism of the muslims praising the moderation of the bourgeoisie and appealing to the caucasian conscience to come to grips with the urgent problems of the ghetto before the burnbaby burn apocalypse to any rational mind the muslim threat was never potent even if we disregard the fact that from almost every conceivable perspective the end product of mem bership in the organization was to provide a benefit to the individual and the community the most shallow analysis of the thinking of rankandfile citizens of the black community would have dispelled any fear of an upsurge of militant muslim sympathy the black_power controversy provides the most recent parallel to this uncanny unfathomable paranoia of even the best thinking white americans this would not be so sad were it not for the fact that what the black community in america needs more than money jobs and education is philosophyor to put it better ideology the negro community needs to think collectively in terms that would sharply differentiate its thinking from that of any other racial or national group in this country and such thinking is the sine qua non the absolute condition to the permanent improvement of the status of the negro in america it is my suggestion as it is a basic assumption of black_power advocates that it is possible for a people to literally pull themselves up by their bootstrapsto miraculously stop behaving the way all the mindless dictates of history and sociology would have them behave such a people whose thinking has been changed by the grasping of an ideology which contains certain truths about their historical and social relationships can change the course of human affairs their thoughts by changing their own political and social posture can change the political and social posture of others black_power is a concept which demands that the black american effect such changes in his thinking now or we might say at last i would offer the white american a simple test take any recent picture from a national magazine which shows a poor negro family standing in the squalorous shamble of a living room in a tenement dwelling such pictures are easy to find for they have a great repute and are much in demand then ask yourself which philosophy the civil_rights philosophy or the black_power philosophy is more likely to get the floor swept first i submit that the clear answer is the black_power philosophy should for any reason whatsoever due to pride anger love whatever per cent of the black slum dwellers decide to sweep their own floors and patch their own walls a social revolution would be heralded that would resound around the world perhaps americas fear of black_power is a fear of this revolution which would so drastically alter the relations between the races in this country the negro as a social construct is not only durable he is useful it permits the white american to deal with the foreign element in its midst without taking it seriously as a human quantity the basic idea behind the civil_rights movement has been that if the negro is sufficiently patient the white people will get the floors of the tenements swept this is the movements conceptual infirmity as it assumes that the black man like a wooden puppet cannot move until the master has pulled the strings it is not clear how great is the investment the white american has in this artifactitious negro character his misgivings over black_power would indicate that the investment being built up over centuries is great indeed if this is so then this country is faced with a great crisis for it is highly unlikely that the faulty assumptions of the civil_rights movement will ever again claim the allegianceif it ever didof any significant number of black americans there is then no choice between civil_rights and black_power the choice is between black_power and the utter alienation that leads to wanton destruction of people and property the sooner the white press and politicians realize this the sooner will they be able to begin the arduous task of cultivating in the minds of the generality of white men a healthy and necessary respect for black humanity the creative possibilities of black_power by dr nathan wright jr theme of black_power in spite of much recent publicity q is not new on the american scene nor is it likely in the foreseeable future to come to a definite end regardless of the outcome of the current debate concerning the propriety of the term black_power black_power has been a continuing refrain in the history of the american negro the slave uprisings which were more frequent than historians often relate continually reiterated the black_power theme it was the clarion call of the rebel john brown and of the abolitionist frederick douglass again the sophisticated and angered web du bois and the militant visionary marcus garvey addressed themselves to the issue of the black mans cooperative strength and dignity and a philip randolphs brotherhood of sleeping car porters came together held together and became a major leverage in american political and economic life through a commitment to what militants today speak of as black_power to what precisely does the theme black_power speak in the negro churches it has most often addressed itself to a kind of black solidarity in a holy war where in an imminent latter day the saints of light who have withstood the evil onslaughts of the powers of darkness will receive their due reward howard thurman in his recent and perhaps his greatest book the luminous darkness speaks of the perception of his early youth that white humanity was beyond the pale of his morality such widespread feelings of the mystical uniqueness of the negro in his corporate life have been the backdrop for the political thrusts which we identify most often as black_power in its first several decades of militancy the national association for the advancement of colored people could be fairly identified with the alleged dissidents of today who speak of the critical force of the negros united strength reference to such an idea today is subjected to the frequent criticism that it is open to misunderstanding is subject to individual interpretation and therefore may be misleading as black_power speaksas it has done over several centuriesto the negros recognition and aggressive assertion of his own fundamental sense of dignity integrity and worth it would and must have at least flexibile implications for no two individuals can perceive of and assert their own validity and place in precisely identical ways the belligerent by nature will tend to express his own sense of being and relationship in bellicose ways the more temperate will tend to use more temperate means nonetheless there may be an apparently realistic danger in a mass rallying to the theme of black_power the negro people over the years have been encouraged by many means to suppress and sublimate their natural feelings of conflict and frustration in this light under a longpostponed and newfound freedom the potential catharsis inherent in the current call to the banners of black_power may be fraught with not unexpected and painful excess black_power may be seen to be a logical and perhaps muchneeded expression of the negros awakening to selfawareness by an overlydelayed and awkward stretching of his arms and flexing of his muscles as he looks half yet untested and unmeasured politibewildered at his newly felt but as cal and moral strength are negroes ready for black_power interestingly those who oppose the use of the term black_power have often raised the objection that negroes court annihilation once black_power comes face to face with white power such a vision of the armed conflict of two opposing and ludicrously unequal camps represents both a misreading of the intent of those who espouse black_power and a failure to understand the necessary dynamics of social and moral progress ethnocentrism or the consciousness of ingroup solidarity with a consequent sense of pride and power is one of the strongest of human sentiments what an ingroup or an ethnic community may be is defined by the culture of which such a group is a part the american culture has defined a number of ethnic groups including notably the jews the irish and the scotchirish who represent religious national or a combination of religious and national groupings all of these groups have intensive pride in their own membership and this is given expression in a variety of ways there are several singular and significant differences in the circumstances of the negros place or role as an ethnic group in american life the negros ability to express his sense of pride has been circumscribed perhaps nowhere has this been more flagrant than in the wellnigh completely successful attempts of the white community with the encouragement and complicity of the nations social scientists to have the negro forget that he is by and large a europeanamerican indianblack african hybrid the negro has been encouraged to forgetas in my own familythat the hickmans and the wrights our family names were of british stock and that the varying shades of color and different textures of hair are a reflection of a variegated ethnic ancestry by culture almost completely and by race to a fairly considerable degree the overwhelming majority of american negroes are of a european background yet the negros sense of limited racial and cultural pride has been restricted to his supposed african origins in a veiled and uncertain past rare is the writer of an american textbook in sociology or history who attributes to the negro anything other than pure african descent except in the semiderogtory sense of illegitimacy even here illegitimacy is an occurrence common to family strains and is simply heightened in varying degrees and by diverse means among the rootless and the oppressed black_power may be seen to be a form of ethnocentrism albeit falling into a trap set by the historically racistbound american culture with the complicity of social scientists who inevitably tend to operate hopefully with some objectively within the accepted frameworks of the society of which they are a part the negros sense of pride is further blunted by the seemingly unamerican assumption that the negros position of social and economic inferiority is immutable the last hiredfirst fired concept here may be seen to be not the multiplication of individual behavior but the logical expression of the mind of a way of life which rejects the negros sense of worth the negro himself has purchased stock in this endeavor partly by recoil in selfdefense and in part by imposed design the american negro has eschewed social equality no major civil_rights leader even today espouses as a major plank in his platform social equality at the very heart of which is the matter of intermarriage yet even economic survival and advancement as well as a sense of pride depend in no small degree upon relationships of a blood and legal variety negroes today are isolated from the jobs not only at the bottom of the ladder but from those so desperately needed at the top to begin a closing of the economic gap admittedly by an absence of contacts whom one knows is for white americans as important as what one knows for negro americans the failure to know people in those intimate and familial relationships which spell care and concern and mutual economic responsibility means no less than a growing fact of isolation from the economic and social fruits of american life which are theoretically their due inheritance the renewed impetus towards the concept of black_power here reflects the apparent readiness of many negro americans to give a perhaps still illusory implementation to their now hoarse and hackneyed and desperate cry of all here now are negroes willing to be aggressive a story is told of an advertisement for what was billed to be the most unusual show on earth the day came finally for the great performance and an audience in curious expectancy was treated to a oneminute show of symbolic behaviour twelve negroes were simply tugging hard at a rope when those who had come for the show demanded an explanation the producer simply asked where on earth have you ever seen twelve negroes pulling together what is apparently true of the american negro is true of all ethnic groups people are all unique and only at critical and measured points do corporate interests emerge for the negro this has been both bane and blessing hence with the current controversy over the use of the term black_power a consensus is sought where no agreement need legitimately exist the fact is that in spite of the massive economic and social signs and indications of the monumental failure of the american people to close the gap in any significant way between where negroes are in relation to their white counterpartsmany negroes are content with the current drift and trend of things negroes as all americans are generally better off today than they were at the end of world war ii the awareness of this fact leads not only many negroes representative of the man in the street but also a substantial portion of recognized negro leadership to speak with apparent integrity of the progress and gains which negroes are making yet the american economy generally has been growing by greater degrees than has the negros alleged progress this leads other negroes of a different type of perceptiveness and of equal integrity to reject the term progress with as great a degree of disdain as that with which some have rejected the term black_power the willingness to speak to the affirmative implications of black_power may be in a wellnigh precise relationship to ones conception of negro progress on this issue negroes are not and doubtless will not be agreed the figures for the relative income of nonwhites in relations to whites over a recent fifteenyear period are as follows the fact that there is no clear statistical trend suggests thateven if the figures may be radically improved for to the idea of a relative and secure indication of progress is for the negro an illusory reality further the current programs under the auspices of the office of economic opportunity and the extensive efforts of private and civic agencies on behalf of negro employment and upgrading are all in the direction largely of lower echelon and madework jobs these serve a basic and absolutely necessary purpose of enabling negroes to survive and of postponing the day of massive revolt in our present circumstance this is no mean purpose and must be given the fullest encouragement at every hand nonetheless the catapulting of significant numbers of the available qualified negroes into positions of high economic value and extensive influence at policymaking levels in our business educational and civic structure remains neglected in a way which may prove to have perilous proportions a sad fact which must be contemplated by all is that in spite of all of our efforts in the negros behalf in the recent past his relative stake in the benefit levels in the american good life have not improved at the same time that his perceptions of his own worth and due inheritance have tremendously increased this suggests the possibility of a heightened sense of polarization within the negro community with numbers of middleclass negroes having bettered their status being understandably under the illusion and spell of progress by the tangible and unmistakable reality of their own personal progress on the other hand however there may be in the days ahead growing masses of the disinherited feeling isolated and neglected believing themselves to be forgotten by their traditional leadership and ever more willing to spell out in word and deed the implications of black_power in terms of the frustration and depth of deprivation which they perceive to make their lot some economists believe that the economic system which is traditional to our culture calls for a fluid reservoir of untapped resource at its base if such a reservoir is neededas may be realistically perceived to be the case from its sustained existencethe rudimentary economic problem becomes a potentially explosive social problem when the group at the bottom is not heterogeneous being entirely of one group comprising both welltrained and some who should be there all through a sense of social injustice such has been the negros plight even with increased education statistically only a relatively small proportion of the economic gap is closed in most communities of america it remains true that only after most white unemployed find employment are the unemployed among negroes given basic consideration hence in our large cities there has been a recent rise from a per cent to a per cent unemployment rate among negroes between the ages of and while the rates for white youth in the same category have been going steadily down the differing lots of negro americans have thus brought about differing attitudes toward the problems of the present and the future human nature historically has not been fundamentally altruistic in terms of sharing power altruism has the sweep of its depth and breadth within the strict limits of our basically keeping the things that we have thus to hope for the aspiring and upwardly mobile negro and those in the secure white community to voluntarily side totally with those who perceive of themselves as the disinherited may represent the height of folly the cry black_power says my share for some for others it gives the totally unfounded illusion of threatening their accustomed or hopefully to be increased abundance can black_power really work the question of the feasibility of the use of black_power is mainly a rhetorical one the perceptions of the relative threat or advantage which others pose for us is always with us further power in terms of human dynamics cannot be calculated always in terms of numbers and this is especially true where morality is perceived to lie at the heart of the matter it is not a matter of whether negroes can express black_power but one of must in the sense that the negroas all who would grow up into responsible selfhood must domust give assertion to his own inherent sense of worth and being several centuries of admittedly crippling segregation and discrimination have not left the american negro unaffected he has been limited in this evil process and it is he alone who must stake his claim to the worth which for centuries he has been denied in this task of giving expression to his own newfound selfrealiza tion the american negro must stand alone no one may do this for him or with him it is so with our children in our own households it is true also with rising social groups here one may appropriate the famed analogy of booker t washington in claiming that today all americanswhite and blackmust be as one as the hand in all that pertains to the extension of the corporate national good life but we must be as separate as the fingers of the hand in the doing of that which each group must do for itself the staking of its claim in its own unpredictable and variegated way to its own due dignity and worth what then is the white mans role it is a changeless law of human life that each man must claim for himself the dignity of his own adulthood those who would deny to the negro this privilege would consciously or unconsciously will for the negro that he be less than what he should be what he would do for himself today has been the privilege of all other americans since the shot heard around the world if the black man has any power of place in american life it is black_power and so the term is simply descriptive of a contemporary and hopefully growing reality in american life as the negros response to the term black_power is mixed so is that of the white community many would applaud what they perceive as the negros coming at last into his own others who have been close to the american negroand who may find themselves in positions of worthy and much needed influence in our national and local civil_rights groupsmay understandably regret the current impetus toward black_power thus to carry the analogy of growth into adulthood further the lament of the white liberal and consequently of organizations in which he has significant control may be not unlike the lament of a foster parent who contemplates losing as a child the one to whom he has become accustomed to giving succour in the movement toward black_power the white liberals perceived reluctance must be understood and appreciated therefore as the difference of one who historically has extended the hand of friendship and upon whose help once the dust of selfassertion has settled the negro must continue to rely to what strategic endsaside from eventual growth and an ultimate furtherance of selfrespect can the movement toward black_power lead there are at least several national selfinterest the negros current restless and aggressive protest points in an as yet relatively mild and presently selfdestructive way to what may well be the massive irrational ultimate and widespread response to the continued arbitrary isolation of the masses of the nations negro poor from economic mainstream of american life either we develop all the nations human resources for their full productive potential and then open opportunities for their effective utilization for our mutual benefit or we create liabilities which become a sustained unnecessary and geometrically increasing burden upon both this and succeeding generations in this light the contemporary impetus toward black_power may be seen to be a restorative and conserving force in american life calling america to save itself from the folly of a myopic vision of what america in human terms is destined and called to be urban improvement the life of our cities needs to be redeemed the negros often angered protest represent the claim that social palliatives in our cities no longer apply and that new and fundamentally creative answers must be found for the sores which fester in the heart of our cities life our urban schools with their contemporary racial unrest remind us that the basic planning and administration of any enterprise at every level must be sensitive to and representative of the concerns of those who are served schools with proprietors as removed from their constituents as our urban systems tend now to be may be seen to be as potentially insidious as the urban system of absentee landlords marginal insights the negros present protest speaks to neglected dimensions of the meaning of democracy thrust to a considerable degree outside the center of american life the negro may be seen to be in a unique and enviable position of bringing new and saving perspectives to basic issues in our national life one such area to which his own pleas for an audience before the bar of american good judgment is that of the extension of the meaning of equality our religious and national heritage as well as the persistent experience of family life speaks to the equitable principle of taking from each as he is able and providing for each as is his need those who may be perceived to be benighted deserve our richest and best resources in enabling them to progress toward standing alone can a truly democratic society reach for less than this humane goal by virtue of his rich experience at the margin of american life we must demand of the american negro that through his fresh insights he ennoble as best he can the common inheritance to which we owe allegiance here a uniquely black_power may be seen to provide rich resources for us all changed status inevitably a declaration of a changed perception of his own position creates a changed racial situation with an altered nature to the problem new challenges await us which can assuredly do no less than provide some new groundwork in exchange for the old from which little that can be called true progress was achieved new conditions and uncharted paths are always fraught with peril we cannot foretell what the future holds in specific or detailed way for any implication or consequence of the impetus toward black_power but the assertion of human dignity and worthas we may learn from experience with our own sons and daughterswhile creating times of testing are productive of much good and growth and gain it is in the confidence and hope that the days ahead as well as the more distant future may be entrusted with its own problems that we built today the human aspect of our corporate life it is in this context that possibly we may come to see and accept as a creative necessity the current focus on black_power to the leaders of america power and freedom is of critical importance that the leaders of this nation listen also to a voice which says that the principal source of the threat to our nation comes neither from the riots erupting cb g our cities nor from the disagreements among the lead ers of the civil_rights movement nor even from mere raising of the cry for black_power these events we believe are but the expression of the judgment of god upon our nation for its failure to use its abundant resources to serve the real wellbeing of people at home and abroad we give our full support to all civil_rights leaders as they seek for basically american goals for we are not convinced that their mutual reinforcement of one another in the past is bound to end in the future we would hope that the public power of our nation will be used to strengthen the civil_rights movement and not to manipulate or further fracture it we deplore the overt violence of riots but we believe it is more important to focus on the real sources of these eruptions these sources may be abetted inside the ghetto but their basic causes lie in the silent and covert violence which white middleclass america inflicts upon the victims of the inner city the hidden smooth and often smiling decisions of american leaders which tie a white noose of suburbia around the necks and which pin the backs of the masses of negroes against the steaming ghetto wallswithout jobs in a booming economy with dilapidated and segregated educational systems in the full view of unenforced laws against it in short the failure of american leaders to use american power to create equal opportunity in life as well as in lawthis is the real problem and not the anguished cry for black_power from the point of view of the christian faith there is nothing necessarily wrong with concern for power at the heart of the protestant reformation is the belief that ultimate power belongs to god alone and that men become most inhuman when concentrations of power lead to the convictionovert or covertthat any nation race or organization can rival god in this regard at issue in the relations between whites and negroes in america is the problem of inequality of power out of this imbalance grows the disrespect of white men for the negro personality and community and the disrespect of negroes for themselves this is a fundamental root of human injustice in america in one sense the concept of black_power reminds us of the need for and the possibility of authentic democracy in america we do not agree with those who say that we must cease expressing concern for the acquisition of power lest we endanger the gains already made by the civil_rights movement the fact of the matter is there have been few substantive gains since about in this area the gap has constantly widened between the incomes of nonwhites relative to the whites since the supreme court decision of de facto segregation in every major city in our land has increased rather than decreased since the middle of the s unemployment among negroes has gone up rather than down while unemployment has decreased in the white community while there has been some progress in some areas for equality for negroes this progress has been limited mainly to middleclass negroes who represent only a small minority of the larger negro community these are the hard facts that we must all face together therefore we must not take the position that we can continue in the same old paths when american leaders decide to serve the real welfare of people instead of war and destruction when american leaders are forced to make the rebuilding of our cities first priority on the nations agenda when american leaders are forced by the american people to quit misusing and abusing american power then will the cry for black_power become inaudible for the framework in which all power in america operates would include the power and experience of black men as well as those of white men in that way the fear of the power of each group would be removed america is our beloved homeland but america is not god only god can do everything america and the other nations of the world must decide which among a number of alternatives they will choose ii to white churchmen power and love as black men who were long ago forced out of the white church to create and to wield black_power we fail to understand the emotional quality of the outcry of some clergy against the use of the term today it is not enough to answer that integration is the solution for it is precisely the nature of the operation of power under some forms of integration which is being challenged the negro church was created as a result of the refusal to submit to the indignities of a false kind of integration in which all power was in the hands of white people a more equal sharing of power is precisely what is required as the precondition of authentic human interaction we understand the growing demand of negro and white youth for a more honest kind of integration one which increases rather than decreases the capacity of the disinherited to participate with power in all of the structures of our common life without this capacity to participate with powerie to have some organized political and economic strength to really influence people with whom one interacts integration is not meaningful for the issue is not one of racial balance but of honest interracial interaction for this kind of interaction to take place all people need power whether black or white we regard as sheer hypocrisy or as a blind and dangerous illusion the view that opposes love to power love should be a controlling element in power but what love opposes is precisely the misuse and abuse of power not power itself so long as white churchmen continue to moralize and misinterpret christian love so long will justice continue to be subverted in this land iii to negro citizens power and justice both the anguished cry for black_power and the confused emotional response to it can be understood if the whole controversy is put in the context of american history especially must we understand the irony involved in the pride of americans regarding their ability to act as individuals on the one hand and their tendency to act as members of ethnic groups on the other hand in the tensions of this part of our history is revealed both the tragedy and the hope of human redemption in america america has asked its negro citizens to fight for opportunity as individuals whereas at certain points in our history what we have needed most has been opportunity for the whole group not just for selected and approved negroes thus in the slaves were made legally free as individuals but the real question regarding personal and group power to maintain that freedom was pushed aside power at that time for a mainly rural people meant land and tools to work the land in the words of thaddeus stevens power meant acres and a mule but this power was not made available to the slaves and we see the results today in the pushing of a landless peasantry off the farms into big cities where they come in search mainly of the power to be free what they find are only the formalities of unenforced legal freedom so we must ask what is the nature of the power which we seek and need today power today is essentially organizational power it is not a thing lying about in the streets to be fought over it is a thing which in some measure already belongs to negroes and which must be developed by negroes in relationship with the great resources of this nation getting power necessarily involves reconciliation we must first be reconciled to ourselves lest we fail to recognize the resources we already have and upon which we can build we must be reconciled to ourselves as persons and to ourselves as an historical group this means we must find our way to a new self image in which we can feel a normal sense of pride in self including our variety of skin color and the manifold textures of our hair as long as we are filled with hatred for ourselves we will be unable to respect others at the same time if we are seriously concerned about power then we must build upon that which we already have black_power is already present to some extent in the negro church in negro fraternities and sororities in our professional associations and in the opportunities afforded to negroes who make decisions in some of the integrated organizations of our society we understand the reasons by which these limited forms of black_power have been rejected by some of our people too often the negro church has stirred its members away from the reign of god in this world to a distorted and complacent view of an other worldly conception of gods power we commit ourselves as churchmen to make more meaningful in the life of our institution our conviction that jesus christ reigns in the here and now as well as in the future he brings in upon us we shall therefore use more of the resources of our churches in working for human justice in the places of social change and upheaval where our master is already at work at the same time we would urge that negro social and professional organizations develop new roles for engaging the problem of equal opportunity and put less time into the frivolity of idle chatter and social waste we must not apologize for the existence of this form of group power for we have been oppressed as a group not as individuals we will not find our way out of that oppression until both we and america accept the need for negro americans as well as for jews italians poles and white anglosaxon protestants among others to have and to wield group power however if power is sought merely as an end in itself it tends to turn upon those who seek it negroes need power in order to participate more effectively at all levels of the life of our nation we are glad that none of those civil_rights leaders who have asked for black_power have suggested that it means a new form of isolationism or a foolish effort at domination but we must be clear about why we need to be reconciled with the white majority it is not because we are only onetenth of the population in america for we do not need to be reminded of the awesome power wielded by the majority we see and feel that power every day in the destructions heaped upon our families and upon the nations cities we do not need to be threatened by such cold and heartless statements for we are men not children and we are growing out of our fear of that power which can hardly hurt us any more in the future than it does in the present or has in the past moreover those bare figures conceal the potential political strength which is ours if we organize properly in the big cities and establish effective alliances neither must we rest our concern for reconciliation with our white brothers on the fear that failure to do so would damage gains already made by the civil_rights movement if those gains are in fact real they will withstand the claims of our people for power and justice not just for a few select negroes here and there but for the masses of our citizens we must rather rest our concern for reconciliation on the firm ground that we and all other americans are one our history and destiny are indissolubly linked if the future is to belong to any of us it must be prepared for all of us whatever our racial or religious background for in the final analysis we are persons and the power of all groups must be wielded to make visible our common humanity the future of america will belong to neither white nor black unless all americans work together at the task of rebuilding our cities we must organize not only among ourselves but with other groups in order that we can together gain power sufficient to change this nations sense of what is now important and what must be done now we must work with the remainder of the nation to organize whole cities for the task of making the rebuilding of our cities first priority in the use of our resources this is more important than who gets to the moon first or the war in vietnam to accomplish this task we cannot expend our energies in spastic or illtempered explosions without meaningful goals we must move from the politics of philanthropy to the politics of metropolitan development for equal opportunity we must relate all groups of the city together in new ways in order that the truth of our cities might be laid bare and in order that together we can lay claim to the great resources of our nation to make truth more human iv to the mass media power and truth the ability or inability of all people in america to understand the upheavals of our day depends greatly on the way power and truth operate in the mass media during the southern demonstrations for civil_rights young men of the communications industry performed an invaluable service for the entire country by revealing plainly to our ears and eyes the ugly truth of a brutalizing system of overt discrimination and segregation many of you were mauled and injured and it took courage for you to stick with the task you were instruments of change and not merely purveyors of unrelated facts you were able to do this by dint of personal courage and by reason of the power of national news agencies which supported you today however your task and ours is more difficult the truth that needs revealing today is not so clearcut in its outlines nor is there a national consensus to help you form relevant points of view therefore nothing is now more important than that you look for a variety of sources of truth in order that the limited perspectives of all of us might be corrected just as you related to a broad spectrum of people in mississippi instead of relying only on police records and establishment figures so must you operate in new york city chicago and cleveland the power to support you in this endeavor is present in our country it must be searched out we desire to use our limited influence to help relate you to the variety of experience in the negro community so that limited controversies are not blown up into the final truth about us the fate of this country is to no small extent dependent upon how you interpret the crises upon us so that human truth is disclosed and human needs are met a new white backlash here came to light not j ritn l ng ago a pathetic ii document that illustrates the total alienation of the militant young negro and his pitiful inability to understand or cope with his problems the documentbelieved to provide the basis for the current uproar about black_powerwas drawn up last winter by stokely carmichael and some other young rebels of the student nonviolent coordinating committee and it dealt with the question of whether white people should play any major role in the civilrights movement no argued the militants if we are to proceed toward true liberation we must cut overselves off from white people we must form our own institutions credit unions coops political parties write our own histories if we continue to rely upon white financial support we will find ourselves entwined in the tentacles of the white power complex that controls this country we reject the american dream as defined by white people and must work to construct an american reality defined by afroamericans this all sounds very fierce but the motive for this paranoid selfsegregation lies in an openly acknowledged feara fear of white people and a fear of ones own fear in arguing for the exclusion of whites from negro meetings the supposed militants offer the explanation that blacks feel intimidated by the presence of whites because of their knowledge of the power that whites have over their lives a climate has to be created whereby blacks can express themselves the reason that whites must be excluded is not that one is antiwhite but that the efforts that one is trying to achieve cannot succeed because whites have an intimidating effect in this frightened definition of their own cause the tactically naive militants of black_power sound less like the cutting edge of the civilrights movement than like the advocates of defeat they resemble those ideologyridden dogmatists both oldguard conservatives and oldguard socialistswho prefer purity to victory who prefer no solution to partial solutions if power requires mass support then the rejection of anyones support means less power and if power requires money then the rejection of anyones money means less power and in this light the program for black_power is a program for black weakness and failure at the same time that the negro militants were talking about black_power in vague terms that show little connection between effort and result the more moderate rev martin_luther_king jr was leading his troops into the very center of the conflictand in a demonstration for desegregated housing in chicago he was met with a barrage of stones bottles and other flying debris it is significant that kings efforts to achieve a reasonable goal by physical demonstrations were finally confronted by brute force and it is significant that kings demonstrators were outnumbered by more than six to one for that is a smallscale version of the relationship of militant white power to militant black_power nor was chicago the only place where northern whites have resorted to force to counteract negro agitation whites too have their urban ghettos their fears and frustrations and mob lusts and it is worth remembering that in the great detroit race riots of the army had to be called in to stop the white mobs from a rampage that would have made the watts rioting seem like a musicalcomedy hoedown it is possible indeed that the violence in chicago coming just a fortnight after the standard negro outbreak inaugurates a whole new phase of the civilrights struggle we have been so bemused for so long by talk about the negro revolution that we tend to assume that revolutionaries must be granted their just demands and even their unjust demands and that revolutions are inevitably triumphant it is not true the english revolution ended with king charles ii on the throne and oliver cromwells head exhibited on a pike the french revolution too ended with the bourbons back in power in our own time the shanghai revolutionaries of were boiled alive germanys karl liebknecht ended in a muddy ditch and a soviet firing squad silenced imre nagys hopes of presiding over a free hungary since the first slave revolts of ancient egypt the history of this earth is in large part a history of rights denied and revolutions crushed in our own country then the danger is not simply the increasing extremism of the negroes but the potential extremism of the vast majority of whites who feeling crowded and threatened are only too ready to suppress this fragile revolution with all the violence at hand we are all let us face it mississippians we all fervently wish that the negro problem did not exist or that if it must exist it could be ignored confronted with the howling need for decent schools jobs housing and all the other minimum rights of the american system we will do our best in a halfhearted way to correct old wrongs the hand may be extended grudgingly and patronizingly but anyone who rejects that hand rejects his own best interests for minimum rights are the only rights that we are willing to guarantee and above those minimum rights there is and will continue to be a vast area of discrimination and inequity and unfairness the area in which we claim the most basic right of all the right to be stupid and prejudiced the right to make mistakes the right to be less and worse than we pretend the right to be ourselves when this majority right is threatened the majority will react accordinglywith results that could be disastrous to all of us by hoyt w fuller columnists and comf mentators are making much of the socalled white backlash against the civil_rights movement they argue with uncommon unanimity that the stiffening resistance of white people against negro demands as exemplified in the large vote for alabamas segregationist governor in wisconsin indiana and maryland represents a significant loss of sympathy among whites for the cause of equal rights the assumption supporting this proposition is that there existed prior to the eruption of school boycotts sitins lieins stallins and the ascendancy of negro militants a great store of sincere goodwill toward negroes on the part of most northern whites and this is almost per cent pure myth if such goodwill did exist for negroes among northern whites then how was it manifested was it translated into activity designed at lowering racial barriers against negroes in the norththese are important questions for the key to the nature of the whole crisis of civil_rights in the north lies imbedded in the answers and yet these are questions few of the editors and analysts are asking the simple fact is thathad such goodwill been prevalent among northern whitesthere would never have developed any need for boycotts and demonstrations and the moderate and responsible negro leaders like roy wilkins of the naacp would never have been eclipsed by the extremists if northern white people generally favored equal rights for negroes then there would have existed no racial barriers in the craft unions no nonnegro hiring policies by many industrial firms no practice of keeping negroes in menial jobs in those firms where they are hired no exclusion of qualified negroes from middleclass or white residential areas and therefore no allnegro schools with facilities equipment and instruction demonstrably inferior to that in predominantly white schools those who argue insistently that negro militance has hurt the negro cause neglect to offer convincing evidence in support of their argument it may be that such evidence is in fact quite small and difficult to come by it is even possible that the argument is used largely as a club with which to dis courage the growing nuisance of demonstrations viewed from the negro side of americas racial wall the proposition that there is a white backlash against the civil_rights movement takes on the character of a particularly insidious canard just what are these proponents of the white backlash theory up to anyway are they genuinely concerned that white sympathizers with the negro cause may abandon the struggle or are they attempting ever so subtly to blackmail negroes into submission surely any honest observer of the civil_rights scene who is capable of even moderately accurate perception must know by now that the white community tends to act in favor of negro rights only in the face of concerted negro pressure rare indeed are the instances where white authority bows to the principle of total equality of the races on its own initiative it is true that northern whites are reacting with some vehemence to the disruption of the status quo but are those who interpret this as a backlash unconsciously equating the status quo with the conditions of amicable race relations to negroes it would certainly seem so many of the whites who now are claiming disaffection with the negro cause because of some excesses on the part of some civil_rights activists or groups are actually revealing their own latent condescension prejudice and intolerance they are in effect seeking to punish all negroes for the behavior of a few negroes which is precisely the excuse southern racists have always employed now these people may proclaim themselves friends of negroes if they choose to but it is extremely unlikely that negroes have ever thought of them as friends this of course is another way of stating the dilemma of the liberal many whites who think of themselves as being friends to negroes would be embarrassed to read what amounts to a description of themselves in a book written by enlightened virginia aristocrat lewis harvie blair back in directing his words to those fellowpatricians who protested that they were gentle and helpful to negroes lewis harvie blair wrote in a southern prophecy but we forget that our kindness to the negroes proceeds from the standpoint of condescension and of assumed caste superiority and we expect it to be received with humility and from a feeling of acknowledged caste inferiority and if not so received by the negroes they are thought impudent and impertinent and the foundation of our kindness dries up the cause of justice and equality is either right or it is not and if it is right it does not become wrong because of the behavior of some individuals or groups concerned with it to say to negroes that their cause is just only so long as they behave in a way to deserve equality is not only to insult negro citizens but it is also to ascribe to white people precisely those powers over negroes which no citizen can have over another in a free society the point is that those who are defecting from support of negroes are those whose support was only token to begin with not only do those whites who believe in real equality still give unqualified support to the cause they also understand how and why many negroes are resorting to extremism these white people are not racists which is to say that they do not assign human rights and values according to race and therefore they are able to put themselves in the negros shoes and having done so they know that nothing short of death would prevent them from insisting that they have the same rights and privileges as all other americans and looking at the prowallace vote in wisconsin indiana and maryland from this viewpoint it is possible to be cheered rather than depressed by the results if wallaces pull of onethird of the vote really means that this proportion of the people oppose negro equality then it also means that the other twothirds are willing to accept negro equality indeed if the vote means any such thing it amounts to a great victory for the cause of equal rights in those two states of course no such optimism is justified what the country is finally facing are the consequences of its own timidity hypocrisy and neglect americans in no section of the country have ever been subjected to any intensive coaching in the honoring of negro rights quite the opposite has been true and even some conservative observers are getting around to admitting as much in a recent column in the chicago daily news john m johnston wrote nobody who reads the papers should be surprised by the wallace phenomenon it was not by oversight that a hundred years have gone by without spelling out the privileges of citizenship for negroes as is now being attempted in washington indeed it was not i suggest that when the full impact of the meaning of the negro revolution dawns on white america the vote in favor of states rights and against goverment interference will be even greater than that recorded in the recent wisconsin and indiana primaries for negroes are in no popularity contest and they are not asking for tolerance negroes are insisting upon their rights as free citizens furthermore it is highly unlikely that negroes will be impressed by the endless admonitions of moderation and pleas for restraint directed at them by whites white people have been telling negroes to wait for their full rights for over a hundred years in fact it is precisely because negroes failed to insist upon their full and equal rights in the north that many of the racial restrictions now prevailing came to harden into custom many people believe for instance that the question of housing segregationundoubtedly a central concern in the nations racial dilemmais a relatively new and particularly delicate consideration in the overall problem but such is not the case the basic federal law on housing was passed nearly a century ago in it provided a year in prison a fine of or both for those who violated the following provision all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property however in the south custom was joined by brutal suppression in the conspiracy against negro rights writing recently in the reporter of the great racist reaction that overtook the country in the s historian c vann woodward had this to say in the south the reaction found expression in whitesupremacy propaganda segregation laws poll taxes literacy and poverty tests white primaries and other devises for disfranchising the negroes it was accompanied by an increase in lynching riots and other forms of violence against the minority race it resulted in driving the negro from all forums and avenues of political life in stripping him of many of the civil_rights and defenses he had gained through the reconstruction amendments and in reducing him to a despised and segregated outcast well negroes now are calling for a redress of all those grievances and it is the nations challengenot his aloneto see that the grievances are redressed with honor and dispatch in recent years liberals have replaced segregationists as the prime targets of negro ire writers like james baldwin and leroi jones have gone so far as to picture the liberals as millstones around the negros neck and poet calvin hernton flatly blamed the failure of white liberals for the rise of the black muslims these attacks of course were not leveled at genuine liberals who are relatively few but at that vast army of americans who mistake a patronizing attitude however subtle for a liberal conviction what most of these people mean when they say they are friends of negroes is that they dont mind negroes as long as negroes stay in their place and that place invariably turns out to be somewhere other than where full and unconditional rights of citizenship are a reality in other words these liberals tend to balk and to reject their convictions at the point where negroes insist on being simply men and women like any others with precisely the same rights privileges and obligations as other men and women and so whites in the metropolitan areas of the north are being flushed out into the openforced to go on recordrelative to their true racial attitudes it was one thing to strike a liberal pose in favor of negro rights so long as what was involved only amounted to a question of unsegregated seating on a southern bus or free use of a public park or even unrestricted service at a sandwich counter but it is quite another matter when this liberality is put to the acid test in terms of jobs schools and housing areas where some adjustment and possible inconvenience on the liberals part is required to make negro equality an unqualified reality white analysts of the civil_rights movement may choose to see a great white backlash but negroes remain unconvinced there is no surprise for negroes in the revelation of widespread bigotry among white people north or south what is happening is that the two major races in this country have arrived at the inevitable confrontation this is the true meaning of this moment this is the service governor george wallace of alabama is rendering to americans he is bringing us closer to the longpostponed moment of truth the time has come when white people are going to have to decide whether they are to be guided by the principles of justice and equality as spelled out in the constitution and bill of rights or whether they are going to submit this system of government to the rationale of racism we are now witnessing the weedingout process the separation of the true believers from the hypocrites from now until the resolution of the race problem one way or another white people will find it increasingly difficult to cloak their desire for white privilege in robes of genteel patronage malcolm the martyr by clarence major ven if nothing else in e y americas social and political fabric justif fied and promised the necessity of malcolm x the words of thomas jefferson would be sufficient if there be any among us who wish to dissolve this union or change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it but of course much more justified his existence though one cannot be sure yet how important his death will be for struggling men everywhere i must confess that i expected malcolm to be a great deal more dynamic in appearance than he was he was striking all right even engrossing but my myth of him was already very big and the man had yet to fulfill it in human image nevertheless the personal encounter remained a gripping one in talking with a white woman about malcolms personal appearance in omaha it was related t this reporter that he turned out to be from her point of view not nearly as militant not nearly as proviolence as she had been led by the press to believe however my informant was a confirmed socialist ive wondered for a long time in considering malcolms sincerity in his struggle for human rights for afroamericans if he realized fully surely he must have how intrinsic racism is to america or for that matter to western civilization one begins to suspect a relationship between racism and capitalism is it any accident that the word wrong contains the letters ngro excepting e but including w and the word right contains the letters ight excepting the letter w but including the r could this be a linguistical accident you know negro and white vranger hwit never mind it was late in the day of the day malcolm was assassinated before i heard anything about it and then it was over the radio and there were several white people writers and admirers of writers in my living room drinking beer they had heard of his death earlier but no one had thought to mention it to me and my reaction was intense then the white girl near me said im so glad he wasnt killed by whites theres already so much tension between the races he perhaps knew the depth of racism in the west but by the end of his life he began to see with faith a brotherhood of all men after his second trip to mecca why wasnt the white girl concerned about his death rather than in who killed him the answer seems obvious the account of that trip to mecca in his autobiography reveals a very honest sensitive and intelligent man whos death certainly did not deserve such a casual remark as came from the white girl in my home what makes it more significant is that the girl knew these facts from having read his bookat least in partas it appeared in a magazine but one does not begin to believe that malcolm had for even a moment accepted the tokenism offered at home in america he wanted and still insisted on nothing short of full human rights and meanwhile he was trying to interest various powers in bringing the united states before a world court to be tried for undeniable crimes against black people which recalls to mind that aborted we charge genocide a petition to the united nations civil_rights congress ny though extremely militant to the end he had begun to gain respect at home as a sincere voice esquire and post used him on their covers and literary and political journals carried transcripts of his speeches and articles about him and his ideas in a brilliant review of malcolms autobiography john woodford stated no man has risen from his societys dunghills to shine with more purity of purpose to scorch the blinking eyes of those who would not see a nation continually perpetuating a racist crime and to illuminate the paths of retribution more brilliantly than did malcolm_x we had to have malcolm and we shall have other malcolms his dream of justice for the black man and the brotherhood of all men are not to be taken lightly if one is concerned with the challenge of our times and the terrible condition the white man has put himself in i realized this when malcolm came to omaha to speak as i listened to him these thoughts were going through me on a brief tv news film before he spoke the revolutionary malcolm used the phrase afroamerican in an interview with a white reporter and the guy thought the pronationalist meant some group other than the socalled negro malcolm smiled to himself i think i know what he felt and thought at that moment looking at that chump rev r e mcnair rev kelsey jones and others of the citizens coordinating committee for civil liberties had invited minister malcolm to omaha to speak anyway these were christians who had invited a muslim to address them all over america black christians and civil_rights workers were turning away from the promise of the establishment the promise was apparently empty a negro man asked malcolm if the whites who had helped in the civil_rights struggle were not sincere malcolm explained that he felt they would do well to work in the white communities toward improvement of their own miserable white attitudes a white man asked malcolm why he left christianity for islam and the latter answered that if what jesus taught is christianity he had never seen any of it in america this answer brought a loud ovation from the black members of the audience i remembered that big redas malcolm was once calledhad already said at harvard the christian world has failed to give the black million exslaves justice for over years of free slave labor despite this we have been better christians even than those who taught us christianity we have been americas most faithful servant during peace time and her bravest soldiers during war time and still white christians have been unable to recognize us and accept us as fellow human beings today we can see that the christian religon of the caucasian race has failed us thus the black masses are turning away from the church back to the religion of islam asked what political system he favored malcolm said that he knew only this capitalistic one and it must he stressed suck somebodys blood to survive he added that the countries of europe were loosing their blood lines in their loss of control over colored peoples and thus the desperate and frantic erection of something called the common market and he also added as he had at harvard earlier already countries are cutting off american trade someone asked malcolm if he expected help from the colored nations of the world in the event of taking up arms in defense of human rights of black americans malcolm said we have friends who care about us and who are concerned for our freedom mao notwithstanding he said that all over the middle east and africa he was met with questions about the stranded black brother in the wilderness of the white mans north america youre not going to find all the whites on one side he said the white community was now split in its attitude toward the civil_rights issues whites who help us dont do so because they love usits only because they see the handwriting on the wall that were going to overtake them the black population explosion not long after this occasion i talked with a young man who worked with students for a democratic society and he flatly stated that whites were pulling out of groups like sncc because of the stronger trend toward nationalism in the light of what malcolm said this is the very root of coercion weve had nothing but legal tricks in the united states courts he said by staying in these courts you domesticate the situation by going to the international level youre taking america to a world court for redress his reasoning was in correlation with the great sociologist william graham sumners in that it was impossible to get justice for exslaves under a capitalistic system which is bom of slavery itself as he spoke he was a handsome figure he was just beginning to grow his mustache which by the time he was killed on february now called dhabihu sacrifice day by some was long and pointed malcolm responded to the acute resolution of mao tsetung who offered unreserved support of the american negro in his struggle against white imperialism at omaha malcolm made it clear that he was in full favor of a real revolution in america the socialist white woman said to this reporter everything he said was just good common sense there was an unmistakable tone of warning in everything he said while the press people there seemed mad and fuzzy running up and down the aisles in the story of his life malcolm later had the same tone in words he knew he faced an evil monster and he knew he was going to die but he had a vision for his brothers on earth chinese would be the leading political tongue of the future and arabic the spiritual whites would not always dominate everybody on earth malcolm little was one of the first negro leaders to really see that any freedom movement not international in range and outlook was foredoomed to failure he is physically dead now but it only proved to us that he lives more fully in our quest one of the truly sad things though was when malcolms younger brother minister philbert wrote a denouncing article about him in the january issue of muhammad speaks newspaper the article appeared on the same page with a cartoon showing malcolms head bouncing down the way of judas brutus and benedict arnold and in the same issue mr muhammad predicted a chastisement for the hypocrites how much do we ever know about the future malcolms half sister mrs ella collins stated i believe that his death was very well planned there had to be inside connections the people involved in my brothers murder had to have contact with a person or persons whom malcolm trusted malcolm indicated to me before he died that he felt he was being betrayed the murder of my brother was much bigger than the black muslims black muslims did the job but with others this wasnt done by one group his death was planned even before he was refused entry into france had he lived through the summer of he would have influenced great changes in america the power structure knew this his death was planned by the power structure of the west hers is the most chilling assessment yet he was liberated from the selfhate and shame which are the unfortunate lot of the masses and he was trying desperately to reach his brothers and sisters in the american ghetto who are still stewing in the fumes and burning from the cops bullets the west didnt give him a peace prize to cool him down but he reached the souls and minds of many black brothers who shall not let his name diewho shall not ever forget that dream of selfhood and nationalism he stood for claude brown the young highly successful man who wrote the book manchild in the promised land says you can call malcolm_x a madman a fanatic an extremistany of those thingsbut none of those categories erases him all i know is that an awful lot of negroes and i mean educated ones thought that malcolm was a cool and tough and dedicated cat whom you had to respect he wasnt going to negotiate with anybody he made you feel tough and right he didnt make you feel you were some kind of creep in a state of evolution brown also said for too long a time the power structure has been sitting down talking with martin_luther_king when they should have been talking with malcolm x but he didnt always get this sort of ovation in print by a nonwhite abdul basit naeem headed one of his articles for muhammad speaks newspaper with this title selfpublicity motivated malcolm not devotion negroes for the most part took a sigh of relief upon the death of elhajj malik elshabazz brother malcolm why though he put into words for them their misery they could not understand nor match his courage and they feared white people in power and malcolm knew this sad fact the challenge of his courage and loyal thrust toward truth as he saw it filled blacks as well as whites with fear and trembling he also failed to reach the black establishment for the same reason he didnt reach the white middleclass it seemed to them both that he was talking about something which had nothing to do with their attachment to things he was seen as a sort of warlord he was as someone has said an old testament avenger he wanted to keep the horror of racism before our eyes because we needed to know it consciously but by the time he became famous the country saw him as it always sees its scapegoats and he knew it america saw the death sign on his head and she saw him too as part of her soul she herself wasnt ever willing to face not long before his death in a debate with other civil_rights leaders malcolm said if you find a person without racism usually j theyre socialist or their political philosophy is socialism was malcolm about to crash the white myth for the whites was he about to crash it for the blacks and show both the lie they live in their white criteria which basely denies all humanity china in the future the end of o the white myth is it very difficult to understand why brother malcolm could not be tolerated in the west today he once said that the worst crime whites committed against afroamericans was that the latter i had been taught to hate themselves though he was officially given the cold shoulder by most negro leaders near the end of his life a few men and women began to take notice and to listen but the black brother has come all the way into the sacrifice and promise of his name and it is a good thing as we have seen in the past however war can change the face of the enemy change peoples lives but today we know war can also change the face of the earth the only thing we are sure of is that this is a time of challenge and that malcolm had a very real part in it a white laivyer named despres by david llorens nically enough j it it was just prior to i chicagos west side up j rising and martin_luther_kings assault on chicagos segregated neighborhoods that the agenda for a city council meeting included an ordinance to approve public housing sites each of them in negro neighborhoods a lean professorial looking alderman spoke to the matter in view of the present condition of this ordinance it ought to be defeated it proposes four intolerable family highrise buildings which our experience has demonstrated to be harmful it is bad city policy and bad civil_rights policy since public housing is nondiscriminatory it says that anyone who wants to live in public housing will have to live inside the segregated negro area and that no nondiscriminatory public housing will be allowed in the white ghetto outside the segregated negro area and what is proposed today is the counterpart of the policy we discussed at the last city council meeting when we considered the actions of high city officials who lead the government and public opinion and reside in buildings and belong to clubs which have rigid barriers against both negro and jewish americans point of order mr president cried a short stocky alderman this is irrelevant and flagwaving it has nothing to do with the sites we are considering the point of order is well taken spoke the chairman who happened to be chicago mayor richard j daley the first alderman appealed the order from the chair on the ground that it would be suppression of highly relevant discussion the chair was sustained with one dissenting vote perhaps the little drama will not seem unfamiliar to those acquainted with debates concerning the urban negro taking place throughout the nations large northern cities but chicagoans think their situation is unique the lean alderman who called passage of the ordinance a naked display of white power is leon m despres his antagonist who usually finds despres efforts on behalf of chicagos negro population irrelevant is alderman claude w holman despres is white holman is black but alderman holmanalong with five other negro aldermen is a member of the cook county democratic party better known as the daley machine and aiderman despres is an independent democrat not accountable to the mayor who also is the chairman of the cook county democratic central committee leon m despres was born in chicago in and has lived in the th wardthe ward he has represented since since he was a small boy the th ward consists of a large part of the integrated hyde park community and most of woodlawn home of one of the nations strongest community organizations the woodlawn organ ization a neighborhood where few but the merchants are white while political action chairman of the liberal ivi independent voters of illinois and engaged in private law practice despres was asked by fellow ivi members to run for alderman elected in and reelected in and in a bitterly contested battle in his opposition to the daley machine in matters of racial policy has become more vehement over the years rather paralleling the mood of the total negro community when asked how he feels about being labeled rebel and maverick by chicago newspapers despres smiles slightly and says well i guess it means i do not accept a very undesirable status quo a motion resolution or amendment introduced before the city council by alderman despres is almost invariably the prologue to a ritual usually beginning with a repudiation by alderman holman and frequently joined by other administration aldermen whose remarks often approach the point of insult despres candidly states holman responds to me on assignment from daley and keane alderman thomas e keane is the administration floor leader and the epilogue to the ritual seldom changes despressponsored measures are usually tabled sent to committee or defeated outright to critics who contend that despres could accomplish more as a member of the regular democratic organization the machine rather than as its chief antagonist he replies i could certainly as an organization man be more effective in terms of patronage and favors but less effective in matters of policy his independency insists despres allows him the freedom to advocate his viewpoints administration aldermen cant talk or introduce anything without permission the outspoken alderman contends that he has more influence on the basic issue of integration because through bringing up issues i can compel the machine to take a position and he adds though they wont give me credit despres cites for example his having introduced early in an amendment to the citys elevator code after four woodlawn children were killed as a result of mechanical failures of elevators the amendment which called for stronger elevator safety requirements was defeated however sometime later the administration on orders from mayor daley says despresintroduced an identical amendment which became law to the six negro administration aldermenoften called the silent sixpolitics means jobs status and money says despres he thinks that because they are negroes they cannot fail to understand the problem of segregation and oppression but the th ward alderman who was supported in his campaign against a negro attorney by such prominent chicago negroes as earl b dickerson and truman k gibson sr as well as by the citys civil_rights leaders thinks that the six negroes are less responsive to the needs of the negro community because they are in the business of living off politics i am not exactly what is the business of living off politics the political machine dominates the negro vote says despres with its mercenary army of patronage jobs from which a man is fired at once if he fails to perform his political work for most of those holding the some political jobs controlled by the machine the political work is precinct workdelivering the vote a former political appointee leahmon l reid now a newsman comments that it was not unusual for one who was reported to be not out ringing doorbellswhich was not a part of his official dutiesto be admonished youre not doing anything for the party according to despres in addition to delivering the vote political work might involve such things as control of the local naacp he also accuses the mercenary army of miscounting padding and buying elections despres thinks political organization is a necessity for civil_rightsminded groups but he contends that infiltrating the machine is impossible if you stay in the machine very long he says it in filtrates you the machine is completely autocratic says the aiderman the ward committeeman appoints everyone and can remove anyone he wants removed there are approximately political patronage jobs available to each ward and the ward committeemen which include five of the six negro aldermen are directly accountable to chairman daley commenting on the widely publicized fact that mayor daley does not tolerate much dissension within his ranks despres maintains that any adulation of daley short of idolatry is considered treason but he facetiously adds daley is not a dictatorhes more like the president of a corporation leon m despres affectionately called len by business associates and friends has consistently pleased civil_rights advocates with his positions he was one of the leaders in the effort to oust controversial school superintendent benjamin c willis described by despres as a man whose entire life has been devoted to hatred the th ward reformist has attempted in vain to push through stronger legislation on open occupancy he has been a familiar figure in civil_rights marches in chicago as well as having made the journey to selma in the spring of a strong despres resolution supporting the move to withhold the seats of mississippi congressmen challenged by the mississippi freedom democratic party was defeated in favor of a weaker admin w tr istration motion one of the more illustrious examples of the battling alderman in action was perhaps a seven hour debate over james baldwins an other country in which he led the opposition to the administrations attempt to ban the novel from a required reading list in a course at one of the citys public junior colleges moreover the session provided insight into the peculiar u situation of the administrations negro councilmen despres especially eloquent in his defense of academic freedom and author james baldwin equated chicagos tammany with moscows kremlin for its censorship efforts and called the book banning venture an attempt to discredit baldwin because he is a negro writer the six negro aldermen sat silently throughout the session but during a recess one of them alderman robert h miller told a reporter the city council has no jurisdiction in this matter he further commented on the ridiculousness of the effort but when the time came to vote on a resolution requiring the board of education to remove the book from the required reading list alderman miller as did the other organization men voted to ban the novel the resolution however later proved futile the session over baldwins novel pointed up the intellectual acumen which appears rather an anomaly in the citys legislative body of leon despres chicago reporter sam blair once noted that despres use of polysyllabic words during a council presentation while capturing the interest of high school observers left the other aldermen puzzled despres a man given to research can be seen taking notes during council sessions with a youthful zest that belies his years both his demeanor and scholarship are in radical contrast to that of his chamber adversaries whose staidness would defy even the ancient roman courts the alderman does not reject the label intellectual but reminds one but that does not mean that i am without human warmth or compassion as a critic of mayor daley despres is invective he thinks the mayor would prefer that city council never meet and maintains that all the decisions are made in daleys inner councils laughingly he speaks of the administration aldermens desperation to make themselves heard often at the opening of a council meeting as many as aldermen will read long speeches memorializing a deceased city figuretheyre real good at talking about dead men despres holds daley responsible for the perpetuation of both housing and school segregation he contends that daley while using the national democratic image and political patronage to hold the negro vote has catered to the segregationist vote by supporting the pattern of segregation he thinks the mayor is threatened by the presence of martin_luther_king jr explaining that the white community will react against the mayor if he is unable to contain civil_rights activity such as marches in the white community white segregationists become angry at people who thwart their hatred says despres although the six negro aldermen have consistently praised the mayor as a champion of negro rights despres without hesitation states daley is at heart and by personal conduct a white segregationist more often than not despres opposes the mayors appointments from those to the school board and library board to the mayors choice for director of the citys commission on human relations the commission says despres acts as midwife to the growth of the ghetto and of its director ed marciniak one of daleys highly touted appointees everyone knew that he was chosen to do the kind of job the mayor wanted done essentially a political cover up the usually quickspeaking alderman answers a bit slower when asked about black_power which he finds an elusive term despres believes the integrationists can save the city if you know anything about the conditions in the united states you understand the notions of black_power ive never joined with those who denounce the muslimswhose headquarters are in my wardwhich doesnt mean that i join them but i understand them segregation says despres can destroy the city he thinks whites should not expect special gratitude or favors for speaking out on behalf of the negro and asserts that you cant fully end oppression until the oppressed have complete freedom to express themselves the alderman described by chicago novelist ronald fair as the only real negro in city government foresees the cracking of the daley machine the place to break the machine says despres is the democratic primaryas an independent in the june primary this year a significant breakthrough to that effect was made two independent negro candidates beat the democratic machine for the illinois state senatorial candidacy and both were expected to beat their republican opposition in november some of despres positions over the past two years have drawn strong criticism from some of the predominantly white hyde park community organizations as well as the university of chicago administration which is located in his ward does he expect that this factor along with the heightened cry for black political power will hinder him in next springs election ive lost a little section of white support he says without a trace of worry but ive gained enough negro and white votes to offset the loss no matter what side one takes on the racial issue it is pretty generally agreed in chicago that when an issue supported by civil_rights advocates comes before chicagos city council one man can be counted on to both speak and vote in its favor but it seems so natural after all leon m despres usually introduces such issues who speaks negro by sarah webster fabio shapiro plays oneupsmanship with robert penn warren in the question he begs both in his negro digest article decolonization of american literature and in his introduction to harlem gallery while warren searches vainly but profitably by editing a book by the same name to learn who speaks for the negro shapiro asks a more loaded one who speaks negro his answer is the late melvin tolson his identification of tolsons language as being authentically negro is a gross inaccuracy which would mislead us into a familiar trap of liking someone for the wrong reason tolson was aware of the solons and sages asking what is a negro searching for his own identity from what he refers to as the ruins of his afroirishjewish grandpa and other racially mixed ancestors he asks who is a negro his answer that the negro is a dish in the white mans kitchena potpourri given in harlem gallery is too simple a truth any notion of negritude which extols the virtue of being a rotten pot with flowers and petals for scent is lacking a full understanding of this concept melvin tolsons language is most certainly not negro to any significant degree the weight of that vast bizarre pseudoliterary diction is to be placed back into the american mainstream where it rightfully and wrongmindedly belongs allen tate recognized the distorted mirror image of the pseudo neoclassical angloamerican diction and i think rightfully interpreted this language as a device of parody much of the dialogue in harlem gallery suggests a satirization of the onedimensional and contradictory stereotypes of negroes whipped up in the kitchens of the white mans fantasy world although i must admit to some difficulty in trying to establish a pattern of tone which would serve as a signpost to the degree of sincerity the poet had for his subject in certain instances tolsons use of the grotesque overstatement excesses of diction at each end of the spectrum suggest that his language was very much a part of the parody language for tolson was a device which enabled him to make his statement about life as he observed it a statement which all but defies paraphrase the language of the negro is classical in the sense that it never gets too far from concrete realities from the thingy quality of objects persons places matter perceived in all its immediacy by the senses and not through oblique references and artificially created allusory illuminations negro if anything is a languagelargely unassimilated and unletteredwhich cuts through penetrates things as they are reflected in spirituals blues or jazz lyrics to a core of meaning eliciting a soulful response to a moment of realization of what it means to be a human being in a world with a stranglehold on this awareness such a language is truly poetic in its lyrical impulse and cannot be faked paul laurence dunbar phyllis wheatley bessie smith mahalia jackson ray charles willie mae thornton langston hughes and leroi jones can come to a lyric with a widely diverse body of diction and still i think speak negro karl shapiro is not expected to understand this it is very difficult although not impossible for a nonnegro to be able to assess this quality leroi jones mulls over this difficulty in the dutchman when clay says you dont know anything except whats there for you to see an act lies device not the pure heart the pumping black heart you dont ever know that karl shapiro in his decolonization of american literature decries the fact that american literature is a countrycousin literature of england he describes it as a three century old child yet clinging to the mothers apron strings an orphan in a far away place filled with sentimental longing for home new culture in every country except ours mr shapiro reminds us is based on home country settler and native in order for an american to become so attached to english literature it is necessary for him to lead an imaginary life shapiro feels and laments the fact that he suffers from this common addiction which amounts to cultural amnesia for a jew he expresses his concern in the statement that living an imaginary english life meant living a phony life of the mind for i was not english in any sense of the word he speaks of the three phases of decolonization in our culture and refers to them as nostalgia assimilation and negritude of these he comments nostalgia is homesickness not for the good old days but for the bad old days assimilation means a cultural entente at the expense of any mystique negritude means assertion of the realities historical and mystical as well the negro he feels is luckier than the jew because there he is unassimilable and unnostalgic the biggest fact of life in the modern world of language he says a language in itself is nothing a literature in itself is nothing a literature is the expression of a nations soul and a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness shapiro assisted untermeyer in editing the modern american and modern british poetry in and by his own above definition of greatness the exclusion of claude mckay paul laurence dunbar james weldon johnson langston hughes melvin tolson and pulitzer prize winner gwendolyn brooks and all black poets writing in english fosters the status quo mediocrity which he deplores to say that the american artist who reaches back to the tradition is by his standards unauthentic is to place almost the total body of mainstream creativity into a bag the authenticity which he lauds would by its very nature be idiosyncratic and difficult and its significance stands very little chance of being recognized shapiro answers the question is negro literature possible by reminding us that given the context of his life in america only a pseudoliterature an uncle tom poem could be created by him and that it would be necessary for him as was the case of paul laurence dunbar to use a phony negro dialect as a medium because oxford english gave him no choice he then asks himself if there were to be an authentic negro medium where would it come from and timidly suggests the spiritual or blues as a likely source the difficulty inherent in shapiro launching a crusade to loosen the hold of the academic mind over poetry which refers back to prior commitments is apparent he must first free himself who would others free cultural amnesia is a historical reality of american negro existence a violent severance of past language customs and human relationships became a necessary prerequisite to the oppressed state that was to become his lot negro contraband culture traveled the long underground railroad of race poetry race music race folklore which is only recently surfacing switching to the main track a concept of negritude forged from historical realities and physical necessity and a races stubborn determination to be is the rich heritage of modern negro poets there are volumes of race poetry records of blues and spirituals to be rediscovered there is a growing body of world negro poetry to explore there is yet the too real daily confrontation of what it means to be negro there is still time to create myths from these realities in all their authenticity and it is a disservice to young negro poets to make them feel a necessity for an artificially created literary frame of reference it is sound advice that he gives when he says it would be better to ignore the existence of the literature of reference and to create whatever we think valid than to go on tilting at windmills this is what the beat writers did they were successful because they refused to take part in the academic dialogue melvin tolson was not a beat poet he was a part of the neoclassical scene whoalthough as able as any to attempt the quixotic feat of reviving a dead horse albeit a trojan horsewas denied a rightful place in this theatre of the absurd like many negroes of this period he was told to go back and perfect the art and then in the great democratic tradition he would be accepted into the society of the neoclassicists he accepted and perfected the art of classical reference as a pillar for an american tradition in literature but became victimized by the cultural lag that is common between the white and negro worlds about this time allen tate the nashville agrarian poets and other champions of this movement gave up this vain pursuit of doing battle with tilting windmills therefore while tolson busied himself outpounding pound his fellow poets forgot to send him the message that pound was out negro poets who did not go out on that kind of a limb could watch the public literary spectacle of mainstream american menofletters and at the same time nurture their own contraband art the fact that negro literary history cannot be traced through mainstream anthologies makes a pointed statement about mainstream american literature and life and the racist nature of this life at the same time it says nothing about the tradition of a developing body of poetry by american and west indian negroes from the revolutionary period to the present negro anthologizers fortunately such as langston hughes and ama bontemps have aptly anthologized this development only a writer who overestimates the innocence of the negro reading public would attempt to sell them on an unseasonable image of the modern negro poet negroes are very hip consumers whether the commodity is clothing or poetry poets like clothes must appeal to the moment and reflect the spirit tempo tastes of the time there is a bold slim line in the mod look an unadorned sophistication outmoded are not only the colonial frock coats of the great white fathers but also the zoot suits the double breasteds even the traditional pin stripe oxford grey with the wide grotesque lapels negroes are tailoring their own fashions this season the new garments promise to be better fits than any of the traditional secondhand outfits which were pawned off as models which suited their fancy who speaks negro any black man who is on top of whats happening spring planting by claude thompson was not until after her fathers digging match that liza ann i knew would the man she choose when you married it was for keeps when you married you sometimes discovered too late that you had made a mistake she could hear her aunt hepzi mind yourself and

going to get dead someday suddenlike no count raskil like his paw and she knew what he meant sitting there as calm as a rock and puffing his chalk pipe with his hands hanging dead over his crossed legs hes going to dead sudden and hed stare across the barbecue into the night yes said her mother those who live by the sword powerful true is the word of god said her father one cannot gather figs in thistles you could hear the toads calling into the night you could see the peeniewallie fireflies aboutand night was made for love and desire and for a girl to choose her man the father of her children if the night breeze touched her cheek it was the fingers of her unknown mate and with it was the smell of the landof life as yet unborn in december the lignum vitae trees had blossomed and it was like a lady in blue now in may it blossomed again but the rains were comingafter the draughtand the pale blue blossoms were beaten to the ground and it was a time of decisionfor planting and she was reminded of the beauty of a woman here today and tomorrow she was reminded of the choice of a girljoy tonight and tomorrow p in december big joe had been making passes at her coming up to see you

after her big joe had a way with womenbold and brassy the other men she knew were too quiet especially fred hed just sit there and look at her and hed have no words to say and somehow she had narrowed it down to one of these two and out of sheer perversity perhaps big joe would win because the other one was afraid to move nice boy that there fred her father would say quiet like and she knew he was feeling his waytelling her what he wanted her to do you may have sons but there is something about a daughter she knew especially a daughter that is an only child especially a tall lissome wellshaped girl growing up in your housegrowing so fast like a field of cornyesterday a tiny plant peeping above the ground and tomorrow a golden field ready for the reaper and you are afraid who the reaper will be you try to hint to her knowing so much of life but even a father is afraid of his own girlchild for if she gets it into her head that you are forcing her into something she will be like the worst of mules she will be like a mule that will kick and bite when you are tightening a girth and she will be no use to anyone you have to break her gently like a mulefirst a bag then a saddle leading her around with a light load and remember to keep her neither in the center of the road nor too far into the bank side as she was broken so would she be she knew it herself and she knew why her father was hinting there is a lot of time everything comes to him who waits all one wants is patience patience when you are young patience to reach fruition patience when the night calls it is like the parched land waiting for the rain it is like the parched grass waiting waiting and everything is in embryo in february when she had looked across the low foothills to the seastanding high on the barbecue with the wind pressing her print dress around hershe had looked across the everdescending and undulating bottom lands to the savannahs and far away in the distance she had seen the white virginal blur of the great catchment to a tank awaiting rain and she had rebelled against the lot of woman to wait and wait perhaps forever and forever was the eternal hills the eternal sea blue far distant and dispassionate waiting for time and god know what waiting through the eternities of man and that had been february february of the parched earth and no one dared to plant day after day the sun had rolled like a molten ball across the skies day after day her father and the other men had looked at the skies and prayed for rain and day after day there had been no rain the parson when he preached spoke of rain he prayed for kindly showers and the people understood that their rainmaker was interceding with god and when they came out they looked for a miracle from the iron skies they knew it would come it must come but when and a girl seeking in her heart asked herself other questions of life someday i shall live but when but men seek water the earth and the green things thereof may apparently wither and die but man and the animals are mobile so they seek water and find it man must have love too he seeks it and then suddenlyout of a clear skyit is all around easter sunday is always a day to remember all the women are in white white the symbol of purity and of the contrite heart white as the slain lamb and here is the familiar spirit of god the only thing the common man over the world may have and the people are filled with the awe of it that a man should die for themeven for them the black people but what is color black people are like all other people they have the good points and faults of all other people but above all people they have had and still have the burden of great suffering out of this has come a great spiritual capacity but this is of the spirit what of the flesh the black people are strong black women are beautiful you can ask big joe here in church or fred there is no other woman for constancythere is no other race of women of such controlled desire and satisfying approach and even in church liza ann knew her father was looking at her and praying to god to give her what it was beyond his power to give her peace and happiness and the love of a good man for she was beautiful you can ask big joe and fred the parson will tell you that the song of solomon is analagous to the church big joe and fred will tell you it is a love song to a black woman it is liza ann sitting in church on easter sunday it is the lovely black column of her neck it is the smooth ebony of her flawless skin like unto velvet you can ask big joe and fred why should big joe go to church and keep away from drink why should fred go to church for a man who died for you do men die in times of peace for strangers do they die for men they do not know when in this age there is only selfishness and greed a black man shall go to church to look at a lovely black young girl and through love of her try to find the beauty that there is in life to find faithfor women believe how else can they live and they cannot live unless they love and love is trust but what shall a young girl believe the song of solomon is an analogy to the church look out over the parched commons to the earth look out over the faces of the black sheep feel the wind on your cheeks and listen to its whisper in the pimento trees and see the sun oh lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world have mercy upon us after the service liza ann had come out into the sun and her father and her mother had had her right along with them and everyone was saying howdy tata higgins howdy miss rosa howdy liza ann and the old black men had chucked her under her chin with their calloused fingers and said to her father tata where dis gal ah grow good looking to go and her father had been proud and they had said to her mother she take after you miss rosa her mother had chuckled and said in embarrassed pride go on with you maas joe and you maas alec and the old men had chucked her under the chin some more and the young men had dreamed dreams they had said howdy liza ann howdy liza ann and the rest had been in their eyessome tomorrow youll be mine and all the while she knew her father was watching themherself and the young men he would shoot stone dead the man who advantaged her he was a godfearing man but for his family he would fight in church and she had been thinking which of you all i cannot make up my mind which of you all if you want me come and get me take me make up my mind for me and she had laughed to herself come and take me haha not with pa around haha stretch out your hand and take me my god pa would have a fit and the thought of it had made her eyes crinkle with hidden laughter and the young men and the old men had smiled themselves and an old man had said whac a happy gal and now her father had spoken and every one had listened men and women it must rain please god if not we will starve i never sees a drought like this in all my bom days last week i been down to savannah and dem is already practically starvin the sins of mankind is heavy upon the earth and the hand of god has fallen upon us and the old men had shaken their heads never a drought like this they had puffed at their chalk pipes and had been lost in thought the women too had held the silence pregnant with hope she had smelled the land in the tobaccofilled air she had heard the land in their voices she had seen the red earth in their dark bodies her country her people herself waiting for rain in may the rain had come suddenly when the tamarind tree in the common opposite their house had appeared almost deadwhen her father had decided to sell his stockthe rain came suddenly in the night it had come first as a hesitant patter and then it had become a steady tattoo borne on a gust of wind hastening to the earth she had known then how the earth must feel and the dark faces of her father and her mother had turned to each other in the lamplight in the morning the world had appeared new she had come out to the barbecue and gone to the tank to see how much water had gone into it but first before she did that she had turned her eyes across the savannahs to the sea had turned her face into the wind and then towards the stone wall now wet on which a bird had been singing her father had come out filled with renewed life as if the rain had poured it into him and over his coffee in the kitchen he had announced that he would have a digging match the next week wednesday he had said going to plant out the three acres cross the common and the only way to do it and ketch the rain is to have a diggin match ill tell them man on sunday and you woman must look after the food ill get two bottles of rum now we got the rain we must keep moving he had been full of plans and he had spent the day in the buttery looking over his tools and mending a pack saddle her mother had said nothing after breakfast she had tied up her skirt in the billowing hoop around her waist called a pokopanya and had taken a hoe and gone out to the land behind the kitchen and began to plant corn you could see her digging a hole in the ground and then dropping the corn in it from a pocket in her apron and then molding up the hole with a bare foot the earth was receiving its own to give it forth again manyfold and liza annwhat had she been doing she was still waiting and it was as if her father had known her dissatisfaction once passing her he had taken his pipe from his mouth and spoken as usual apparently to no one everything comes in gods own time it is strange how time appears to fly when one looks back at it you spend all the days in expectation of an event and it seems a lifetime away and then after it has come and gone you discover that it had come too quickly wednesday morning had been upon them before they knew it they had hardly set a light to the large blocks of dried pimento wood that formed the fires beside the stone wall and put on the kerosene tins of chocolate and water to draw the coffee before the men had begun to arrive singing and shouting all the women who were helping with the food had been there already and now came the men singing bring me half a hoe come gi me yah bring me half a hoe and she had heard big joe roaring above the rest with a hoe over his shoulder bring me half a hoe and where had fred been he had been standing inconspicuously in the crowd and he had not been singing you never knew how these digging matches giving free labor to ones neighbor ever got under way one moment they are drinking large steaming mugs of chocolate and coffee and then they are off a great line of men is surging across the field they are digging potato hills in one mad frenzied struggle right across the field the hoes are rising and falling with all the strength of the wielder you never knew that men could work so hard and out in front had been the singing mansinging and dancing and controlling the match singing fast songs to get the tempo of the race making up his own words galoh galho they had gone across the field like mad leaving a straight line of potato hills behind them and now they were coming back and the pace had begun to tell twice more they had to cross the field they had begun to string out panting sweating straining every muscle and out in front had been big joe and behindit had seemed impossiblefred the spectators had been shouting and the men had been coming along with a desperate hurry big joe had never been beaten in any match for a year now and yet here was a challenger to the champion of the district to the people it had been only thatthe champion digger and a challenger to her it had been more than that the battle was for her it had been as if at the end she would be the prize and that was what she knew they hoped to getthe prize of her esteem the pace had told the same two had gone far out in front and big joe had become desperate he had hurried his strokes and put too much into the down swing of his hoe and fred had come up abreast then the race begun in deadly earnest one man it seemed had to collapse hill after hill they had come down the line and the old people had come to stand on the finishing line hill after hill they had been coming and then imperceptively fred had come ahead and strangely she had been glad a hill ahead could he hold it her father had spoken the greatest diggin match i have ever seen in the district and old custos the oldest man in the district had said only once afore i ever see a match like this and the winner dropped dead fear had seized her heart they had come on and on then there was a great cheer for the new champion they had been panting as at the end of a long running race they had only been able to lean on their hoes while the sweat had run down their dirtbegrimed faces and then it had happened someone had laughed at big joe and in moving he had bounced against her and she had drawn away and big joe humiliated before her eyes had said who the raas you drawin away from since when you become so damn stocious fred had dropped his hoe and hit him so hard that big joe had rolled on the ground then big joe was up roaring hell yah today she had stood petrified and her father had rushed big joe and big joe had hit her father knocking him down and her father had rushed for his gun the men held big joe and fred and over it all she had heard her mother shouting jesus christ tek him away before tata come out with him gun jesusah dont want tata hang for murder and then there had been a roar from

wallbig joe well up in front and she not knowing what she did had taken fred by the handand suddenly the gun had spoken lawd jesus everyone had fallen flat on their faces and big joe had crawled

laughas the warning shot he had shouted everybody get up ahm not shooting anyone tell that big joe boy to get off my place and to stay off and when he came up to them fred and herselfand said drop in at the house anytime son and then she knew it was as simple as that by wilton sankawulo hat westerners think w of the african society today is expressed in two radically different ways the one is an apology for the african situation the other is a sharp condemnation directed towards some stagnant elements in african society and the many misadventures used by africans to remove them but none of these evaluations has been successful in producing any positive effect than can achieve the goal of creating a better flourishing society because the two of them have not as yet been received in good faith by africans this situation can only be redeemed by creating a meaningful dialogue between africa and the west africans cannot allow themselves to be deceived when westerners tell them that they have been right all the while and that the negative judgment they rendered against them was due to ignorance the fact that the african society is relatively stagnant shows that something is fundamentally wrong which must be discovered and excised for the sake of progress a professor of mine used a quotation from andre gide at the beginning of a book he wrote about the kpelle people which is this the less intelligent the white man is the more he feels that the african is stupid but it is not lack of intelligence that is mostly responsible for the condemnation in many cases evaluation of the african society has been conducted by wellmeaning specialists in anthropology history politics and religion if their efforts fail to get at the heart of the matter is is because they have been restricted to the material culture of the continent and have not entered into a real dialogue with the people any man given all the practical evidences of the situation will have to be negative in his judgment of them lets face it the people are poor plagued by superstitions incompetent leadership disease ignorance etc progress however cannot come about by telling them to transform the entire continent for it to develop after the pattern of western society those who advocate this point of departure would say all that is needed is time time will bring about the necessary change western culture which cost westerners hundreds of years to produce cannot be imposed upon these people in an arbitrary way if it will be useful and beneficial to them but time itself is only an historical phenomenon if it is not rightfully used there is no guarantee that progress will come about by itself the reason for progress in the west is not to be found in time but essentially in the western spiritthe restless search for something better the comparative dissatisfaction with what is already possessed if the individual is convinced that what he is doing or what he already has is good enough he will never see any reason for seeking something better he will always hold fast to it if time is not used as the condition for change it is education which is advocated but again education by itself does not bring about change of course i believe what bertrand russell saidthat the man who is in a house which is on fire will be in a better position to save himself if he knows how to get out than another man in the same situation who does not know how to get out but it is still true that a man in a burning house may know how to get out and refuse to save himself many of those who are violently opposed to improvement and progress in africa are educated africans they are the ones who become excessively defensive of the african culture and take suit with the westerners who are apologizing for it it is not uncommon to see a university graduate reverting to superstition as a valid way of coping with mental problems in africa in witch doctors and psychiatry judith randal writing for harpers magazine defends the psychiatric practice of dr lambo a nigerian psychiatrist using witchcraft to treat mental patients as a scheme that makes sense her argument is that this method of treating mental patients is good for this special society but the question is not whether dr lambos psychiatric practices discharge rate compares favorably with that of the best western mental hospitals or not but is it a realistic solution of the problem it is easy to make a sacrifice in order to eradicate the fear of lightning which is prevalent among natives of west africa but one must be prepared to make another sacrifice when the fear of lightning is replaced by the fear of spirits or darkness or rain even though a wholesale importation of psychiatric practices from the west may not solve the problem it doesnt mean a sentimental reversion to the ancient practice of witchcraft will do i think this reversion of the african to his old archaic formulas for the solution of social problems is done much more out of protest rather than realism the african must make a truce with the historical reality in which he finds himself the european has come and ruled him and in this ruling the african has suffered the loss of his own value systemhas been encouraged to follow western standards which in some crucial cases may not apply to his own circumstances but this does not justify the african culture as such improvement is needed to make this improvement the african must search deeply in his own spirit in his own problems to know where improvement is needed there is no easy answer to this problem what judith randal regards as making sense is not to be misunderstood however most westerners who support the africans retention of his own culture have good intention they tell us of the dangers africans must reckon with in modern civilization the problems of migraines neuroses and the complicated nature of modern life which entails nervousness they are exceedingly impressed by what they consider as the innocence of the noble savage the peaceful village life the absence of crime in the clanvirtues which are all radically destroyed wherever modern civilization takes sway but mankind must learn to appreciate the fact that life at all levels is never lacking in danger perhaps outwardly we may be impressed by the innocence and peace of the village life but it is threatened by disaster as much as modern urban life the villager is subject to the assault of wild animals diseases low rate of production in farming thus famine superstition and fear etc he like his modern counterpart for whom life has become extremely complicated is not safe what he needs is the knowledge to cope successfully with the demands of development the modern westerner may be suffering from the complication of modern civilization because perhaps he had no civilization more advanced to learn from its mistakes but the african has the advantage to recognize in the western world the problems that go with developed civilizationand to help him is to train him to handle these problems to live in his socalled innocent and peaceful village is in fact more dangerous and unnecessary for he would be subject to problems that could be solved by modern technology and so we come to the conclusion that things as they are in africa are not progressive and satisfactory the fundamental mistake which africans and westerners have been making in trying to bring about progress is the advocation of one of two extremes that cannot work the first extreme position is as indicated the acceptance of things as they are with the opinion that they are good and meaningful and must not be disturbed by bringing in modern civilization itie second extreme position is the advocating of a wholesale importation of western civilization far more insight into these positions i would like to deal with two typical books written by two westerners in trying to justify them the first book is called new song in a strange land written by esther warner the problem with this book is that it is superficial like the books of laurens van der post it praises the african life without compromise what esther warner is telling us in effect is that the africans in fact have something to teach westerners their civilization or way of life is good and honorable and all the westerner must do to discover this is to become an anthropologist she is duly impressed by the innocence and wisdom of africans and every statement they make concerning certain facts of life is invested with rich meanings but i think all the implications or meanings she derives from the africans are more or less what she brings into their thoughts rather than what their thoughts contain with her sophisticated western education it is easy for her to take seriously something that africans may say in error or ignorance or jest this is primarily due to the fact that the africans she dealt with were not essentially educated she dealt with ordinary native men who worked around her house and she did not really know their languages when an african man tells her that a missy cant know he is apparently expressing his inability to communicate his knowledge to her he is not implying the fact that he has some insight into reality which a westerner is unable to understand esther warner of course is aware of the desperate pathetic nature of the african life she took a trip into lomaland to see superstition at work and the unnecessary tremendous toll of life it took she recollected this in another book called seven days in lomaland and so we might then ask why in new song in a strange land she attempted to defend such a life her defense might have been invoked by the fact that she discovered the immensity of the problem with which the africans must wrestle the extent of the difficulties does not permit any optimistic hope of finding a possible immediate solution but to find a means of solution is to have an adequate knowledge of the problems which unfortunately she lacked in another book the silkcotton wood tree she tried to describe the problems as intimately as she could and her apparent failure at an honest evaluation was still due to a lack of insight into them for instance she had a girl explaining to a boy the secrets of the womens society the fact that this is an unforgivable sin to commit is balanced by her immodest narration of it in every conceivable way she proved to be totally strange in the land and thereby the problems of the land remained strange to her in a book of fiction like the silkcotton wood tree the protagonist should have been a westerner i think a westerner who wants to evaluate the problems of africa through fiction must use as his protagonist one of his kind whom he understands writers like w somerset maugham and graham greene have been successful in writing about foreign places because they chiefly used this device this is still looking at things with the eyes of a westerner but at least the danger of misrepresentation will be minimal we will know exactly that the evaluation of the problems shows the westerners point of view which is important for africans to know what you take yourself to be must be balanced by what somebody else takes you to be out of the medley of such observations you will come closer to what you really are left to your own devices and judgments you may believe that you are very important or very unimportantor glorify or condemn certain aspects of your personality which someone from the outside could view objectively and judge fairly africans welcome criticisms from the outside although they must yet realize the importance of criticisms from the inside they would readily accept the criticism of someone from the west and bar their own people from criticizing them it is a dangerous thing to live by the opinions of others to the exclusion of your own from the experiment of esther warneran experiment which most westerners are urgingwe realize that a sentimental attempt to preserve the african culture as it is is impractical but the alternative of changing it radically as urged by jens larsen cannot be the rule anyone who accepts reality as it is and not as he wants it to be will find in jens larsens tom toms a classical and dramatic presentation of the african situation jens larsen presents as his main character kwoli a traditional kpelle wan who in a way peculiar to himself and in the world in which he lives returns home upcountry from a socalled civilized community in sierra leone in kwoli we are made to see a frantic attempt to redeem a lost humanity in an acceptable social term namely western civilization he clearly has a rational motivation even if it should be rooted in a vague apocalypse which he believes will be and can be realized given the necessary attention and effort indeed kwolis aim is genuine and great he sees the effectiveness of western civilization and hopes to use it to redeem his homeland from superstitions for progress while he opposes superstitionsor what he considers to be superstitions he is forced to be resilient to their pressure perhaps until the right moment when he can successfully eradicate them he goes into the bush school mens secret society to become an initiate of itthereby becoming a fullfledged member of the tribe kwoli then is caught between two social realities african and western it is hard to understand if his acquiescence to the african tradition will necessarily lead to the establishment of western civilization but the most important thing is not to know how kwoli will resolve this difficulty but to know the propriety or need of changing the social structure as a whole one does not need to go very far in reasoning to realize that this attempt to change radically the african society is a selfdefeating attitude for one thing kwoli holds the traditional culture in contempt and in his imagination it is a necessary evil which must be eliminated perhaps if kwoli had approached the situation with a disinterested attitude of mind to find out the main problems to solve them we could hope that he would be successful in redeeming the society the life of any people no matter how primitive or advanced it is has some positive and negative aspects where the negative aspects exceed the positive as in this case the tendency is to dismiss it as unrealisticand evil people everywhere have their own sense of values or concept of reality which can only be modified and enhanced but not destroyed to destroy it is to destroy the people and if kwoli is chiefly concerned about performing works of destruction we cannot see how he will ever redeem the people the predicament in which kwoli finds himself is due to the fact that he is not really educated in western civilization to the uneducated manas he isthe modem civilization may appear very attractive an adoption of it is more important than using it to solve problems jens larsen maintained a very significant logic in the development of the story when he showed that kwoli needed more education he had been serving as a porter for bradley a surveyor who had heard about a missionary in the area and advised kwoli to go to him for more education i should like to keep you but for your own good ill turn you over to the missionary when he comes i know he will be glad to employ you as a helper and give you private lessons he must take the long and hard road of learning this new tradition before passing it to others with more than a superficial understanding of this tradition he shall most probably discover a way of using it for the benefit of his people and not their destruction after breaking this illusion in kwolis life in the first part of the book jens larsen indefensibly falls in the same trap he tried to avoid instead of trying to show kwoli getting enough education to come and use it for the development of his society he repeats the same message which he gave us before in the first part of the book the need for change in fact the message becomes much more eloquent and vehement the missionary langdon i out of his frustration and disap pointments writes a long letter to the home church in justifying his lack of satisfactory statistical records of converts which alone would convince them that every dollar they contribute to the work is bringing satisfactory results as if spent elsewhere i think it is very unfair to compare mission work in africa with mission work elsewhere in the world in the asiatic mission fields for example missionaries have for the most part been able to build upon a foundation of culture developed through centuries just as st paul did in greece and rome at the beginning of the christian era but in africa in general and in liberia in particular it is entirely different here in the interior of liberia the negro is still living in his state of primitiveness our task then is not only to introduce christianity but also to create a culture to serve as a foundation for it and this takes a long long time perhaps what jens larsen did not realize was the fact that everybody in the world is already cultured you cannot create a new culture anywhere the problem is to accept what is already present and modify it or improve upon it another thing he did not realize was the fact that the transmission of christianity cannot be identified with the transmission of culture in the asiatic mission fields where culture is present missionaries are getting as much difficulty in christianizing the people as in africa in fact the presence of a formal culture may be a tremendous hindrance to the advancement of christianity more than anything else st paul failed to convert the philosophers in athens the day must yet come for a buddhist to leave his religion for christianity but it is not only at this point that we see a serious flaw in the book all of a sudden we see kopu appear in it kopu really eugenie is supposed to be the daughter of a professor of howard university she was kidnapped when she was a little child while her parents traveled with her through the liberian jungle she lived and grew up in this jungle the incidents centering around kopu are real and true but she is caught in them in innocence children who were kidnapped by the leopard society when it existed in liberia must definitely be related to the kidnappers it was rareto some extent unimaginable that a stranger a white person at that could become a part of a tribal mystery rather than a tribal warfare her presence is nothing less than an attempt to reinforce a strong advocation of western culture for africa in a much more serious way it is a judgment against the african culture as a whole and its need for complete change perhaps we should stop exploring the book at this point the problem as i see it that the africans must struggle with is the attempt to discover what they really want and to work realistically towards it they have to evaluate the african situation as they are experiencing it and work towards improvement it is an african problem if the westerner does not sympathize with africa he will condemn africa if the african man does not approve western civilization he will accept it in a most radical way all of these attitudes are simply evading the real issue the africans need to find out what he really wants and to work towards achieving it without adopting any easy formula there are africans who are trying to compromise or reconcile western civilization with the african civilization this also is unrealistic while some features of western civilization may be useful in africa there are many other features of it that are unsuitable to the african situation and so there is no way of playing safe at this point the african must find out what he needsand if he should escape this fundamental necessity there will never be an improved advanced africa the african countries will always be in the developing stage and what africans will have to reckon with perpetually will be the two cultures african and westernand they must use them as means to the end of developing an appropriate african society it is not a matter of choosing between the two or trying to reconcile them tm worried about a manchild by nikki giovanni hat problems occupy me personally well im worried about a manchilda manchild who will inherit this a black manchild in the quest for his lost manhood does he know what hes looking for will i have to become a white woman before he can claim it sometimes it seems thats what im supposed to be now that he is on the move im castigated for being a black womana strong black woman who has fed and clothed him and his children since he has decided the time is now must i play the silent innocuous thing who suddenly doesnt have the strength to open a jar of pickles let alone organize a block club for fear of castrating him is it necessary that i cease being a black woman so that he can be a man is it fair it seems to me that we are involved in several protest movements none of which should be based on innateness his sex has given him no innate right to rule im worried about a manchild who says hes making a revolution with the nonwhite peoples of the world if hes making revolution its with the colored people the world is colored and noncolored not white and nonwhite thirteen per cent of the world has no right to decide how the other per cent will refer to itself and if my manchild allows that minority to decide he is not making revolution hes not even off the plantation im worried about a manchild who says the colored people on relief unemployed or unemployable are not worth trying to get to because they are illiterate and dont understand the revolution i wonder why now that he is hip to the i was going to use a bad word but decided to play the lady bit coming down he isnt more patient with his unenlightened brothers hell spend all day talking to a liberal but doesnt have five minutes for the man nobody has time for i wonder when well quit playing bull fight you know the bull gets out there and tries to kill the cape dont be like that bullgo for the man jews get used too im worried about a manchild who says he wont fight until all other afroamericans are ready to fight that attitude is the reason we have a protest movement instead of a revolution and im especially worried about my lover in vietnam who thinks he should be killing somebody elses manchild but every time stokely carmichael opens his mouth every time leroi jones picks up his pen every time i see a malcolm_x button or a think black bumper sticker i know we are on the road to revolution we used to think we could hitchhike our way down freedom road but what they did was to put us on protest highway while they took the white supremacy express well we put a panther in our tank and robert williams at the wheel and turned the car toward mecca the most important step we have made toward revolution is the step away from the west but we have only made steps ram is a step goal is a step the muslims are a step and we must recognize them as such all we are doing now is getting ready to revolt we are on the road and roads have ends at the end of this road will be the revolution not the completed change but the painful beginning at the end of this road we will have decided that policemen should not carry guns we will revolt to see to it that they dont at the end of this road we will have decided that the only property man is entitled to is the house he lives in we must revolt to our own neighborhoods we will have decided that everyone should have a guaranteed annual wage and adequate medical care regardless of age that the state should pay people to travel to learn languages to attend college and graduate school before it starts we will know that there is room on this earth for any number of different peoples and that we do not have to annihilate any group before we can be free take power from themyes but to speak of wiping them out thats such a white solution and i am not picturing any revolution that will not begin for another years i fully expect to be free and to taste the fruits of the power tree that has been de nied me it will take blood some of theirs this time and it will take daring but we will do it reprise in new york arly last october e during a state visit to the united states by president leopold senghor of senegal the american committee for the first world festival of negro arts feted the african diplomat at a reception in new york city the reception also served as the occasion for the presentation of awards to american winners of prizes during the international festival last april while scores of invited guests appeared at the rebekah harkness house for ballet arts for the ceremonies some of the prize winners were not present notable among those absent were abbey lincoln and ivan dixon winners of acting awards for their starring roles in the film nothing but a man however the films coproducer robert young was on hand other prize winners who did appear were robert hayden winner of the grand prize for poetry and dr kenneth b clark winner of the grand prize for a book in the social sciences poet langston hughes accepted the grand prize for painter william majors and musician louis armstrong for the hello dolly album and sigmund galloway accepted the grand prize for his wife mahalia jackson for her album greatest hits among the writers painters and officials present were jacob lawrence rosa guy richard saunders and marian anderson by millicent dobbs jordan ow that the impassioned fervor of identifying with blackness for the sake of blackness has become so familiar one feels a need to assess the meaning and value of negritude could it be a sour grapes device sophisticated flippancy or merely whistling in the dark pun intended this was the great themequestion of the first world festival of negro arts held in dakar senegal april officially or unofficially the word negritude was on everyones lips for many it was an old word for others it was quite new but for negro americans it was the latest variation of soul who needed to define soul though you either had it or you did not have it inexplicable or not soul is a tenuous intangible esprit de corps as it were as old as slavery itself the american descendants of africans knew from the earliest days of servitude that their sins would find them out and their sin was in their skin it was so easy to identify a runaway slave that eventually a curse became a blessing the slaves had to stick together to comfort each other to try to establish a workable morale they learned this lesson well and handed it down from generation to generation in spirituals through prayers and in unspoken empathy were all in this damned leaky boat together are we going to sink or swim and gradually there came into existence various techniques for survival the most significant one germinating in the minds of the dark brother mere selfassertion was not enough there was a need for prideinnegroness dont be ashamed of being a negro later grew into bolder doctrines of race pride it became necessary to move beyond the negative concept of raceconsciousness so as to say quite positively that there are values to be derived from being negro hence a therapeutic creation of soul the seeds had been sown as early as the eighteenth century when negro poets orators and writers such as phillis wheatley torn from her native senegal at age seven or so george moses horton and frederick douglass centered their thoughts around the virtues of freedom and liberty for all in america the more militant marcus garvey born in established the back to africa movement the gifted paul laurence dunbar became the uncrowned poet laureate of negro america his poignant little brown baby wif spaklin eyes allowed negroes to look at themselves without shame the nordic standard of beauty became irrelevant this attitude became more crystalized by the erudite w e b du bois who wrote souls of black folk in however it was not until after world war i that many people began to reevaluate old established patterns of thought during the late s there emerged in uptown new york city a genuine cult of negroness called the negro renaissance by many it focused attention sharply on the fact that the negros views of himself were diametrically opposed to the white mans views of the negro generalization though this may be in essence it is true harlem then became the heart of negro americahomea place where a negro could be comfortable being a negro a group of brilliant young negro artists primarily writers started publishing beautiful proud soul messages to themselves and to all other negroes handsome globetrotting young langston hughes dared to make the world accept the blues the humor the everydayness of the negro he and other writers such as james weldon johnson countee cullen rudolph fisher waring cuney claude mckay and sterling brown infused into the hearts and minds of young black people long before world war iithe idea that the negro had a talent a gift a meaning quite simply they called it soul it was not difficult for a negro to catch the message it was sent in many ways through a song a book a sermon a jam session or through a downhome meal the message further said weve got something the white man doesnt have and the white man in his ambivalent suntanning haircurling nightclub singing way wants it too this soul thousands of miles away from harlem in the african country of senegal a sensitive young intellectual leopold sedar senghor later educated in france used his poetry to express great pride in black africa he called it negritude president senghor of senegal gave the opening address of the first world festival of negro arts at the colloquium on negro art in the life of the people dakar senegal he set forth the function of the festival by spelling out the function of negro art in the life of the black man he explained saving us from despair this negro art sustains us in our effort toward economic and social development in our determination to live two other events of the festival may help to illuminate the aspect of negritude the first occurred on easter saturday in a very inventive production of the passion play called the dark disciples blues version of the st luke passion though the story was old the interpretation was new this time the actors were black jesus mary pontius pilate the disciples it was only when judas came forth to kiss jesus that one saw a white face this was negritude in a moment of exquisite subtlety the other event was a moment of history called goree though the festival offered authentic dance troupes by the dozen poetry recitals drama cinema and fantastic art in resplendent array one encountered a sense of destiny a confrontation with ones past when he embarked for the island of goree only a short distance from dakar small easily fortified goree provided a natural quarantine of such strategic importance that it became the most important slave market in africa no visitor could be properly prepared for the actual sight of the slave dungeons yet there they weremute testimony to unspeakable cruelty horrors and torture a monument to mans inhumanity to man one saw with great anguish the narrow low slits of ratinfested cells into which had been crushed and jammed endless numbers of captured africans the only egress was the rockbound coast of the atlantic ocean goree the aching womb of africa had spawned and then had spewed out one of the great evils of the modern world yet selfinduced pride in the survival of the fittest or an inoculation of the soul against adversity was bom there and though it is caustic and bitter to be a thing apart it is good therapy to use the hurts the threats the insults sweet are the uses of adversity negroes in order to survive have had to use their adversities as a means of becoming stronger than more flexible than and often more understanding than their oppressors one fine day when all sick people become well it will no long er be necessary to communicate the message of negritude because everyone in the land of the free will have learned the language of the soul for the man or woman who has everything except negro digest the only monthly magazine dedicated to making america aware of what negro writers

pioneer negro historians by john hope franklin very generation writes its own history any nationor any peopleis as sensitive about its past as it is about its future nothing reflects so much the way it will approach the future as does the way of looking at the past the changes that each generation experiences provide new ways of looking at the past nothing better illustrates the way that experience guides the writing of history than the manner in which the history of the negro has been viewed and written during the slave period when the great majority of white americans regarded slavery as the natural and desirable lot of the negro those who wrote about the negro assumed that he had no history in this country that was worth mentioning when the negro was mentioned at all the statements were as likely as not to be inaccurate or simply not true such historians invariably white usually treated the negro with a silence that was itself eloquent in its assumption that the negro had no history even their discussion of slavery was viewed not as a part of the negros history but as a part of the labor system of the white man and it was full of errors the early histories tell of the arrival of the first slaves in but the record shows that the twenty negroes who landed in jamestown in were not slaves but were indentured servants many of whom were virginia freeholders within a few years these historians make no mention at all of the stern resistance that negroes put up against slavery all during the colonial period or of the thousands who served in the continental armyafter george washington finally permitted them to enlist during the american revolution not only did the white historians assume that the negro had no history worth noting but also that there were no negroes who could possibly argue otherwise it came as something of a shock therefore to discovereven during the period of slaverythat there were negroes who began to write the history of their people one of these was james w c pennington a runaway slave who after he was twentyone years of age learned to read and write he became so distinguished in latin greek german and theology that the university of heidelberg germany recognized his achievements by conferring on him the honorary degree of doctor of divinity pennington did not write a great book he could hardly have been expected to do so but with the appearance in of his work a text book of the origin and history of the colored people one can say that negro history was launched its significance lies in the fact that it appeared at a time when white americans were giving serious attention to the history of their country but no white historiannot even the great george bancroftgave more than slight attention to the almost three million negroes that constituted sixteen per cent of the population at that time when the slavery controversy was at its heightin the decade before the civil warone of the most widely used arguments supporting slavery was that negroes were so inferior that they had contributed nothing to the development of the country william c nell a bostonbom free negro was outraged by such fallacies and was determined to set the record straight in after years of labor he published his work entitled the services of colored americans in the wars of and in a revised and enlarged edition appeared nell reminded americans of the role that the fugitive slave crispus attucks played in the socalled boston massacre he told of peter salem and salem poor two brave negroes at bunker hill and he had much to say about the other negroes who fought in the american revolution it was about this time that martin r delany a graduate of the harvard medical school turned from his professional duties long enough to write a work that surveyed the history of the negro since his arrival in the new world and described the condition of negroes at the time of the writing negroes were taking to the writing of history and biography in increasing numbers after frederick douglass narrative of his life appeared in other runaway slaves wrote of their own experiences the world learned much of the history of american negro slavery from the pens of the black participants it was a strange thing wonder of wonders that even after the civil war the white historians memory was incredibly short when he discussed matters touching on the history of the negro thus one wrote the following in a book that was widely read in the years after world war the american negroes are the only people in the history of the world who ever became free without any effort of their own they had not started the civil war nor ended it they twanged banjos around railroad stations sang melodious spirituals and believed that some yankee would soon come along and give each of them forty acres and a mule the writer ignored of course the continuous and systematic resistance to slavery in which many slaves were involved even more important he ignored the categorical statement of president lincoln that the use of negro troops of themconstituted the heaviest blow yet dealt the rebellion small wonder that negroes began to give more attention to their history in the years after the civil war negroes saw their position being attacked not only by the ku klux klan and similar terrorists but also by those who were chronicling the events of civil war and reconstruction they knew that they had no chance of getting their story into the works of the widely read white historians of the period and that is one good reason why they began in earnest to write their own history william wells brown already a distinguished novelist and dramatist with a heroic past as a leading negro abolitionist turned to the writing of history his principal work in history was the rising son which appeared in he pointed out the difficulty of securing authentic materials but he asserted that he had throughout endeavored to give a faithful account of their people and their customs without concealing their faults brown was merely the first of a considerable number of negroes who in the reconstruction and postreconstruction years wrote about the history of their people there were william still who wrote the underground railroad an exciting account of an activity in which the author had participated and joseph t wilson a veteran of the civil war who told of the exploits of negro soldiers in a book with the colorful title the black phalanx the most outstanding member of the group and indeed the most important negro historian of the nineteenth century was george washington williams although a young man of thirty when he began writing his monumental history of the negro race in america williams had seen a great deal he had served in the united states army during the civil war had graduated from a theological seminary had studied law and passed the ohio bar and had become the first negro to be elected to the ohio legislature i became convinced williams said that a history of the colored people in america was required because such a history would give the world more correct ideas about the colored people and incite the latter to greater efforts in the struggle of citizenship and manhood when his twovolume work appeared in it was immediately recognized as the most ambitious work ever undertaken by an american negro williams took nearly a thousand pages to tell the story and the very size of the work astounded americans who had thought that the history of the negro could be told in a page or two within a few years williams was hard at work on his history of the negro troops in the rebellion which appeared in he did exhaustive research in all the records then available and he produced a work that left no doubt in the minds of any who were willing to read it that lincolns praise of the negro troops was fully justified williams was writing during those postreconstruction years when the status of the negro in the united states was steadily deteriorating in the year that his history of the negro people appeared the united states supreme court declared unconstitutional the civil_rights act of three years after his book on negro soldiers appeared the mississippi constitutional convention wrote into its organic law suffrage provisions that effectively disfranchised negroes soon south carolina louisiana north carolina and the other southern states followed in the supreme court gave its blessing to the doctrine of separate but equal meanwhile an incredible number of white americansintellectuals literary figures public servantswere engaged in a fullscale attempt to justify segregation and discrimination by arguing that the negro was totally unfit for citizenship as professor rayford logan has shown in his book the betrayal of the negro the most respectable and respected journals described negroes as superstitious stupid imitative ignorant happygolucky improvident lazy immoral and criminal in the face of such studied insults and such deliberate efforts to keep negroes in their place what were negroes to do during the s and s they despaired as much from the libels against them as they did from the laws that segregated them but they were not daunted they fought segregation and discrimination in the courts and in the legislatures they fought the libels with words as well as deeds negroes argued in a veritable flood of books that they were entitled to their rights because through the years they had earned them w h crogman of clark college deserted his classical studies to write a volume entitled the progress of a race he sought almost desperately to prove by an enormous array of facts that negroes had contributed mightily to american life a few years later john w cromwell would attempt to do the same in the negro in american history there were others the best known of whom is booker t washington whose twovolume work the story of the negro appeared in some of those pioneers wrought well others fell short of the mark few of them had either the intellectual equipment or the training of w e b du bois whose first historical work the suppression of the african slave trade was published in as the first volume of the harvard historical studies few of them had the imagination or zeal of carter g woodson who founded the association for the study of negro life and history in and negro history week a decade later each of them in his own way was seeking to fill a great void in the history of the united states e a johnson the school teacher in raleigh north carolina who later was a member of the new york legislature summed up most adequately what the pioneer negro historian was trying to do in the preface to his a school history of the negro race in america published in johnson said during my experience of eleven years as a teacher i have often felt that the children of the race ought to study some work that would give them a little information on the many brave deeds and noble characters of their own race i have often observed the sin of omission and commission on the part of white authors most of whom seem to have written exclusively for white children and studiously left out the many creditable deeds of the negro how must the little colored child feet when he has completed the assigned course of u s history and in it found not one word of credit not one word of favorable comment for even one among the millions of his foreparents who have lived through nearly three centuries of his countrys history the penningtons the johnsons and all the other pioneer negro historians clearly saw what their task was in performing their task they launched an entirely new field of study which has only recently come into its own one of the most cruel things that one could do today would be to forget or ignore pioneers such as these early negro historians one of the most praiseworthy things one could do would be to recognize the enormous importance of their keeping the light of truth flickering until it could be kindled by greater resources and many more hands by irvin h lee eneral nathaniel p banks commander department of the gulf said in referring to their combat behavior it gives me great pleasure to report that they answered every expectation their conduct was heroic no troops could be more determined or more daring banks a union officer who led his forces victoriously at shenandoah valley new orleans and mobile bay was referring to the gallantry and martyrdom of his negro troops of their bravery at millikens bend captain matthew m miller company i commander of the ninth louisiana infantry said so they fought and died defending the cause that we revere they met death coolly bravely nor rashly did they expose themselves but all were steady and obedient to orders such were some of the praises bestowed upon negro soldiers and sailors who fought in the civil war and they not only fought they fought gallantly sometimes displaying a sheer heroism which when looked upon by the nation in whose name the conflict was called forth naturally caused that nation to seek an unprecedented means of rewarding them that reward was the medal of honor presented to twenty black patriots who distinguished themselves by their courage in action and other soldierlike qualities during the war between the states someone has said he who possesses the medal of honor is the holder of the highest military award for bravery that can be given to any individual in the united states of america this symbol of bronze bestows upon the man who has received it a great privilegethat of sharing in the company of the few heroes who have been honored by the award of the same medal he wears there were negroes who served in the union army and on union ships during the civil war most were contrabands or slaves who escaped from their masters to the union lines general benjamin f butler made the first effort to deal with them at fort monroe in he and later general ulysses s grant used the blacks to build roads and fortifications this discriminate use of valuable manpower caused considerable controversy in the north for more than a year the union debated whether the contrabands should be armed and mustered into the army the confederates were already using negroes in their armies louisiana for example had organized the louisiana native guard later known as the first regiment infantry corps dafrique tennessee and south carolina also used negro regiments in the field this prompted certain leaders in the north mayors governors and the like to increase their demands for the employment of negroes as union soldiers in august black units were organized in rhode island kansas and massachusetts by the time president lincolns emancipation proclamation was issued on september nearly negroes were trained and ready for the smoke and din of skirmish and battle along the mississippi the louisiana native guard was the first negro regiment to serve in the union army the blacks were volunteers who fought with the confederates but were treated badly by their white officers to escape this humiliation the negro troops allowed themselves to be cut off by union forces and gladly surrendered general butler then pressed them into service with his forces many of the exslaves eventually found themselves fighting their former masters in a matter of months so many troops had been recruited that on may a bureau of colored troops headed by adjutant general lorenzo thomas was established in washington d c to handle affairs of the negro units negro soldiers trained and fought on a segregated basis and were not treated as the white infantrymen they experienced discrimination and disadvantages the negro for example received seven dollars a month but whites received thirteen because of this discrimination many of the negro combatants became restive sullen and even insubordinate yet the majority of blacks were less interested in the fact of being treated differently than having the right to fight as free men and prove their courage and devotion perhaps sergeant major christian a fleetwood a medal of honor winner best exemplified the negroes motivation when he said he enlisted to save the country from ruin fleetwood served with the fourth u s colored troops in action at yorktown petersburg new market heights and fort fisher sergeant william h carney of the th massachusetts colored infantry was the first negro of the civil war to earn the medal of honor it was at fort wagner south carolina a point vital to the capture of charleston south carolina that he and his fellow patriots bore one of their severest tests of valor it was july the weather was perfect union land batteries opened cannon fire from the southside and were joined simultaneously by six ironclads at the same time the negroes began their charge as they felt their way up the steep jagged face of the fort a barrage of hand grenades exploded about them the negroes advanced upward ignoring death a dozen fell simultaneously dead or wounded among them was the color sergeant carrying the national flag before the colors slipped from the relaxing fingers of the wounded bearer sergeant carney sprang forward and seized them in spite of wounds in his legs breast and right arm he led the way to the enemy fortification and raised the colors for half an hour carney lay on the forts outer slope for protection when the union troops were forced to retreat under heavy fire he retrieved the flag when general grant left the west to take command of the union army and direct the fighting on the crucial virginia front he insisted on bringing negro infantrymen at deep bottom virginia on july four black regiments the sixth u s colored troops among them fought heroically in one of the fiercest campaigns of the battle for virginia the negro volunteers bore the enemy assault gallantly especially sergeant major thomas hawkins he earned a medal of honor for rescuing the regimental flag during the engagement of the action in which about blacks died major general d b birney th corps commander said it was one of the most staring and gallant affairs i have ever known sergeant decatur dorsey also earned his medal for saving the colors at petersburg virginia on july faced by musketry fire in front and a cross fire of shells from the flanks the negro troops charged toward enemy lines some stopping briefly to fire their weapons others taking cover in pits as originally planned dorsey a member of the th u s colored troops surged forward and mounted his colors in confederate territory in advance of his regiment when the unit was driven back to union lines he carried the flags there then bravely rallied the men later the blacks moved over the rebel defenses and engaged the enemy in close combat taking two stands of colors and prisoners for the only union success of the day while the negro soldier was proving his courage the negro seaman was going ahead in his service to the country most of the union navys negro sailors were contrabands because there were not enough white men available in the north exslave robert blake was decorated with the navy medal of honor for valiant service as a powder boy aboard the u s steam gunboat marblehead on december during an engagement with the confederates that christmas day off legareville stono river on johns island seaman blake bravely defended his ship while manning the rifle gun his repeated counterattacks forced the enemy to abandon the island position leaving the caisson and one gun behind of his service blakes commanding officer said he excited my admiration by the cool and brave manner in which he served nearly six months later on june the uss kearsarge had a daring encounter with the confederate raider alabama off cherbourg france aboard the union gunboat were fifteen negro enlisted men of various ratings among them was seaman joachim pease loader of the no gun during the bitter engagement which resulted in the sinking of the alabama pease earned a navy medal of honor for his marked coolness good conduct and gallantry in the action acting ships master david h sumner in reporting on peases actions said he fully sustained his reputation as one of the best men on the ship later john lawson a landsman served aboard the flagship u s s hartford during a skirmish between rebel gunboats and the ram tennessee in mobile bay on august from the vessels mainstep rear admiral david d farragut directed the union attacks against fort morgan the onetime refugee slave camp lawson suffering from a severe leg wound was thrown violently against the side of the ship when an enemy shell exploded the shell burst in the midst of the sixman crew knocking them to the shell whip floor on the berth deck as soon as lawson regained his composure he returned to his battle station despite repeated pleas from captain percival drayton and others to go below for medical treatment he remained at his post until crewmen of the tennessee had run up the white flag in surrender landsman aaron anderson received the medal for service aboard the u s s wyandank during a boat expedition on march participating with a boat crew in the clearing of mattox creek anderson carried out his duties in spite of devastating enemy fire which destroyed half the oars pierced the launch in places and cut the barrel off a musket being fired at the enemy negroes earned eleven medals of honor for valiantly and effectively serving with the union army during campaigns at chapins farm virginia on september private william h barnes of the th u s colored troops although wounded was among the first of his unit to enter rebel territory and rally the union forces during one engagement his medal was awarded on april for that demonstration of bravery sergeant major fleetwood first sergeant alexander kelly sergeant alfred b hilton and private charles veal were decorated for rescuing the colors during separate encounters with the confederates at chaffins farm fleetwood a member of the fourth u s colored troops seized the colors after two bearers had been shot and carried them nobly during the fight fleetwoods unit lost about out of less than men during the battle relating his fellow infantrymens courage he later said the negro stood in the full glare of the greatest armies ever mustered upon this continent competing sidebyside with the bravest and best of lees army losing nothing by comparison when the regimental color bearer fell during another attack at chaffins farm sergeant hilton of the fourth seized the color together with the national standard he then led the charge on enemy lines until he was wounded by rebel fire in an advance near confederate barricades in another charge the colors had fallen first sergeant kelly seized the flag then rallied the men of the sixth u s colored troops amidst confusion and heavy enemy resistance when two other color bearers were shot in another skirmish close to enemy territory private veal seized the national flag then without concern for his own safety he led the fourth u s colored troops through the most dangerous areas of battle though most of the negro units were commanded by whites there were seventyfive negro officers including eight physicians serving in the civil war yet there was no possibility of advancement for enlisted men into the ranks of commissioned officers this fact however did not mean the blacks did not possess leadership qualities they did and it was pointed out at chaffins farm there were cases of enlisted men gallantly leading their men after commanding officers were killed five of these sergeants received medals of honor for such valor on september one was first sergeant powhatan beaty fifth u s colored troops he took command of company g and gallantly led the men when all the officers were killed or wounded first sergeant james h bronson did the same with the fifths company d as did sergeant major milton m holland with c company and first sergeant robert pinn of company i fifth u s colored troops first sergeant edward ratcliff th u s colored troops took command of company c after the commanding officer had been killed he then gallantly led his men and was the first to enter

was reached the rebels fled under heavy fire without waiting for the union soldiers bayonet charge sergeant james h harris who earned a medal of honor for bravery in the assault and the th swept over the fort and conquered new market road the enemys stronghold five hundred fortythree negroes lay lifeless in a space yards long after the advance back at chaffins farm the following day september corporal miles james exemplified the negroes courage as the battle for the farm continued james took his position within thirty yards of enemy territory rebel fire mutilated one of his arms yet he loaded and fired his weapon with one hand in spite of continuous pleas to have the shattered arm treated he urged the men of the th u s colored troops to press the assault near the end of the war colonel thomas wentworth higginson heroic commander of the rd noted no officer in the regiment now doubts that the key to the successful prosecution of this war lies in the unlimited employment of black troops instead of leaving their homes and families to fight they are fighting for their homes and families and they show that resolution and sagacity which a personal purpose gives it would have been madness to attempt with the bravest white troops what i have successfully accomplished with the black ones and so it was with the emancipated negro in war between the states twenty of them won the medal of honorthe nations most coveted military decoration of the medal of honor winners who in over years pushed their devotion to their country beyond the call of the possible the negro was among them they earned most of their medals while risking death to save a nation which had enslaved them the man who saved washington dc by c l lewis of tourists eager for firsthand iwl knowledge of america s patriotic history flock to washington dc each year they tour the endless monuments and marvel at the unique design of the nations capital yet few realize that without the contribution of benjamin banneker an th century negro native of baltimore county maryland the city might not exist its famous location simply a muddy undeveloped tract on the banks of the mighty potomac the winning of independence had brought a sense of heady jubilation to the new nation a collective symbol of the nations pride at gaining freedom was needed it was nationally agreed that the construction of a permanent capital was the answer selection of the site was another matter competition was keen among cities that wished to be the new home of government activity philadelphia boasted that it had been the seat of the continental congress the first shot for independence had been fired in boston freedom was actually won at yorktown annapolis wilmington trentoneach had a good reason why it should be chosen as the capital of the united states george washington favored a section along the potomac river not far from his mount vernon home on july congress passed the resident act giving the president authority to choose a mile square territory on the potomac virginia and maryland contributed land to the undertaking george washington appointed thomas johnson daniel carroll and david stuart landowners of importance in the region commissioners of the district it was agreed that the federal district should be designated the territory of columbia and the federal city the city of washington pierre charles lenfant who had fought side by side with george washington in the revolution been wounded at savannah taken prisoner at charleston and suffered the miseries of valley forge expressed a desire to participate in the project washington appointed him to draw the plans for the new capital lenfant was hot tempered and arrogant from the very beginning a struggle for authority developed it was a rainy spring the entire district was a mass of mud yet despite the adverse conditions land speculation reached a fever pitch everyone wanted to see the map that lenfant was working on but the frenchman refused to reveal even the slightest detail charges of selfish interests were thrown at him lenfant collected all papers concerning the proposed construction and with three surveyors among them benjamin banneker he continued to work alone finally in a fit of anger over failing to obtain extra funds for the project the architect left the country taking with him the only available set of plans it was a grieved thomas jefferson then secretary of state who summoned workers on the project to the temporary capital in philadelphia to seek a solution to the crisis he feared that a completely new beginning would have to be made not even he had seen the plans when asked for suggestions the group was shocked to see benjamin banneker stand and ask if lenfants plans had been satisfactory jefferson stated that he had never seen the plans then asked the reason for this odd question i have the plans in my head said banneker his photographic memory had retained the intricate details of the drawings redraw the plans as soon as performable jefferson ordered banneker returning to his home near ellicott mills maryland completed the nearimpossible task in three days major andrew ellicott was named to succeed lenfant as chief architectural planner banneker was chosen his chief assistant banneker was born a free landowner legend relates that his grandmother was an english dairy maid sent to america after being wrongfully convicted of theft his grandfather the first bannka son of a powerful african chief was sold into slavery by arab traders this remarkable man had little formal schooling yet rose to prominence in several fields including farming astronomy and editorship of a widelyacclaimed almanac at the age of with knowledge gained from taking apart a watch he perfected the first clock in maryland possibly in america in later years banneker spent long periods observing the joys of his life the stars and the farmlands he had known since childhood on october he died while sitting beneath a tree atop a hill overlooking the fields near his home the federal gazette and baltimore daily advertiser october reported on sunday the th instant departed this life near his residence in baltimore county mr benjamin banneker a black man immediate descendant of an african father he was well known in this neighborhood for his quiet and peaceful demeanor and among scientific men as an astronomer and mathematician newer negro history by benjamin quarles the title new er negro history a reader may ask himself isnt the past like it always was the answer as he already knows is that the past does not cannot changeas omar the tentmaker reminds us the moving finger writes and having writ moves on nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line nor all your tears wash out a word of it but what does change is our understanding of the past our interpretation of it men are always seeking a more meaningful recovery of the past a proper study of history has much to be said for it including its possible influence on the shape of things to come to make the future said carter g woodson the father of negro history it is necessary to remake the past fortunately in the years since woodson lit the torch many other writers have been throwing fresh light on the negro in our history like other aspects of our national life history is now being desegregated old outlooks giving way to new these revisionist viewpoints are numerous this is to be expected inasmuch as the negros roots sink deeply into the american past a brief description of a few of these better known reassessments might serve to suggest their scope and variety no other aspect of negro history is undergoing such a reappraisal as the african background particularly the west coast bulge that comprised the ancestral homelands of the american negro until the recent discovery of historical africa the notion prevailed that when the europeans ventured down the west coast beginning with the portuguese in the s they found the natives living in primitive barbarism and savagery until recent years most people have thought of tropical africa as having been outside the paleits peoples having fallen behind in the march of civilization its cultures as having been static it followed therefore that when the african was brought to the new world he was little more than a brute the belief that black africa has no history had a twofold origin with the coming of the european powers the west coast kingdoms passed into a state of colonialism their histories were not taught indeed it was assumed that no such history existed it being a cardinal premise of colonial rule that the history of the subject people dates from the arrival of the conquerors moreover once determined to exploit africas human resources the europeans men of religion and conscience had to convince themselves of the innate inferiority of the natives and the worthlessness of their traditions to slave traders and outsiders in general it was comforting to believe that africans were the most backward of all the peoples making up the human family today these outmoded viewpoints of the african past are on the run the work of routing them owes something to the pioneering efforts of w e b dubois who in the s praised africa as the negros greater fatherland from the beginning of a long career as a scholar at his desk and a crusader in the public arena dubois correctly sensed the existence of much scientific knowledge of africa which has never been brought together in while teaching at atlanta university he made his first attempt to launch an encyclopedia africana an effort he was to undertake for the third time in then upon the invitation of kwame nkrumah president of ghana dubois was not destined to complete his dream of an encyclopedia he died in at the age of but he had left his mark on african scholarship perhaps his most notable disciple was william leo hansberry whose life was changed after reading one of duboiss books the negro published in this slim volume was like a new planet swimming into hansberrys ken its two hundred and fortytwo pages he wrote were packed with innumerable facts not only about ancient kush and old aethiopia but about a whole series of kingdoms and empires which had flourished elsewhere in black africa in historical antiquity and in the middle ages but of which up to that time i had never read or heard a single word in duboiss pages hansberry read of kingdoms and cultures that as he noted were already hoary with age when hellas was still an infant and rome was yet unborn determined to read the books on africa mentioned by dubois young hansberry went to harvard university which dubois had attended during the cambridge years hansberry immersed himself in the study of the powerful and farranging kingdoms and empires of the west coast in subsequent years he reenforced his knowledge by study at the oriental institute of the university of chicago and by archeological field trips in nine african countries hansberry shared his findings with others both in the classroom as professor of early african history at howard university and through the printed page he is esteemed in the continent whose history he has helped to resurrect in his honor the university of nigeria has established the hansberry college of african studies in the government of ethiopia named hansberry as the initial recipient of the haile selassie i african research award he died in november not having quite completed his crowning work a comprehensive history of the lands he loved so well the pioneering work of dubois and hansberry in the rediscovery of the african past was reenforced by that of white scholars foremost among these was melville j herskovits whose myth of the negro past published in was a landmark in african studies herskovits set out to demolish the argument that the ancestor of the american had been culturally naked when he came to the new world on the contrary said herskovits the negroes of west africa had developed a complex civilization one that embraced advanced political systems operating under codes of law a well organized economic life which in many cases included the use of money and a deeply ingrained artistic urge which was manifest in a profusion so diverse as to include the use of a wide variety of musical instruments an ear for the subtlest rhythm the production of imaginative art in woodcarving bronze and ironwork an evident skill in clothweaving and basketry and a literary impulse that found outlet in tales proverbs and riddles following the lead of herskovits a number of other white researchers turned their attention to the african past in a group of such scholars organized the african studies association in another group one of predominantly english membership founded the journal of african history by the early s african history had emerged from obscurity into acceptance as a recognized field of historical study writes philip d curtin in his excellent booklet african history another authority robert i rotberg of harvard in his scholarly book a political history of tropical africa points out that the existence of african history has in recent years achieved widespread recognition many universities in america and europe now offer general and specialized courses in the subject at several levels news media are similarly aware of its respectability the recent wave of interest in the african way of life past and present has been furthered by the american society of african culture a negro organization founded in as stated by its president john a davis its purpose is twofold to inform america about the great contribution africans and people of african descent have made to the world of music dance sculpture and painting and to give to the american negro a pride in his originshis heritage across the atlantic and finally on this point african history is destined to become better known because of the work of africans themselves the new ly independent nations of tropical africa are now busy recreating their own pasts the scholars in their new colleges and univeristies will help lay the myth that the peoples of africa were backward and uncivilized before the penetration of the europeans the emergence of african history will do more it should be added than to restore some early missing pages to negro american history african history will prove an antidote to the longstanding neglect of nonwestern cultures it will make necessary a revision of the traditional sequence in studying history a sequence which begins with the fertile crescent and then proceeds successively to greece rome and europe winding up in the united states just as the african background is undergoing restudy so too is another phase of history that had until recently been put to use as a proof of negro inferioritythe reconstruction period this was the tenyear span right after the civil war a period in which negroes sat in congress and in the legislatures of the southern states according to older traditional viewpoints these negro legislators were extravagant corrupt illiterate and incompetent willing pawns in the hands of scheming white politicians this period of republicannegro rule in the south has indeed been difficult to assess accurately the reason lies in the fact that the sources on which the historian must depend are so often shot through with bitter partisanship most of the historians who lived in the america that emerged out of appomattox behaved as though the civil war was a continuing war many northern writers still viewing the former confederates as unreconstructed rebels and most southern writers defending their antebellum viewpoints and thinking of the war as a lost cause which deserved a better fate such onesided views have often been accepted by later generations of writers including historians of note the role of the negro in reconstruction has long needed a saner review until recently many of the standard works on the period have been written by men who believed that the negro was innately inferior a belief which militated against sound judgment being in essence a nineteenth century white south point of view fortunately more and more we are getting a more balanced picture of the negros role in reconstruction the period itself is now being viewed as a time of experimentation rather than as a dreadful decade reconstruction legislatures are now being credited with many important reforms such as establishing free public school systems and making it possible for people without property to vote and hold office the negros participation in politics is now no longer viewed as disastrous the majority of negroes who sat in the state legislatures were honest public servants men who have a genuine interest and a genuine earnestness in the business of the assembly as eyewitness james s pike wrote concerning the ninetyfour negroes who sat in the south carolina legislature similarly the socalled carpetbaggers the whites who were allied with negroes during reconstruction are now being viewed more favorably these carpetbaggers have generally carried a bad name originally given to them by those who disliked equality for the negro what better way to discredit negro voting than by attacking its supporters and so carpetbaggers were charged with being adventurers whose only interest was in making a fast dollar at the expense of the stricken south recent scholarship however has made it more and more apparent that many carpetbaggers school teachers ministers businessmen and public officialswere people of good will who were anxious to build a better south for white and black alike the old stereotype of the dishonest yankee carpetbagger has been challenged again in otto h olsens recent biography of albion w tourgee able judge of the north carolina superior court and author of a fools errand a novel of reconciliation the two decades following reconstruction were low points for the negro who had been shorn of the ballot and whose civil_rights had been whittled down by supreme court decisions but oddly enough it was not until the turn of the century that segregation laws took a sharp rise c vann woodward in his book strange career of jim crow points out that most of the segregation statutes of the south dated not from the s as might be expected but rather from the late s this was the case in many southern communities mary white ovington writing of her visit to atlanta in spoke of the refusal of dr william h crogman of clark to accept the new city statute that demanded segregation he would not enter an atlanta street car at first he had a horse and buggy but when the college could no longer afford this he walked and it was no short walk to the city woodward shows that the souths racial practices were shaped by segregation statutes he thus refutes anew the argument that the law is powerless to change attitudes and behavior in the field of race relations and that any desirable change must be brought about through the efforts of voluntary groups and agencies exercising patient understanding and using the techniques of friendly persuasion those who assert that legal measures are not the answer to problems of racial adjustment would be amazed to discover the extent to which such legal measures have been used to fix and delimit the status of the negro throughout our countrys history the newer negro history has many aspects but their central theme and their total impact may be summed up in the phrase the negro belongs in a historical sense of course the negro has never completely escaped the attention of the historical guild but generally he has been thought of as a source of labor or as a source of problems he has been viewed as among us yet not of us an enclave in the body politic but the overwhelming majority of negroes have never thought of themselves as aliens as a separatist group frederick douglass the most prominent negro of the nineteenth century asserted that it was better to be a part of the whole than to be the whole of a part we are americans he wrote and as americans we would speak to americans gunner myrdal has termed the negro an exaggerated american in the sense that his americanism does not stop at per cent indeed it has been because of this sentiment that negroes have been so critical of their country and so discontented with some of its practices because of their americanism negroes have taken the declaration of independence at its face value because of their americanism negroes have measured their living standards and their opportunities in terms of the american experience not by the yardstick of some other lands or some other peoples this identificationwithamerica sentiment is not hard to explain the negros roots are deep in our history here before the mayflower he is in truth an old american as such he has been a contributor to the making of america he came with the earliest discoverers and explorers negroes provided as much of the heritage of the american continent as any other group writes anthropologist paul bohannan the economy of the antebellum south its production of tobacco sugar rice and cotton rested on negro labor the negro fought in all of americas wars he took part in the westward movement a story only now becoming known negroes were on every mining frontier from california in to the end of the gold rush in the black hills of dakota writes w sherman savage the negro has consistently stood for democracy and equality the extension of civil liberties in our land owes much to him the cultural patterns he brought from his ancestral homelands have left their design on the broad american fabric the south has unconsciously absorbed the gift of his folktemperament his humor sentiment and imagination wrote a a schomburg the negro bibliophile similarly in the negro in american culture margaret just butcher points out and proceeds to prove that some of the most characteristic features of american culture are derivatives of the folk life and spirit of this darker tenth of the population as colored americans come to know something of the newer updated negro history they can better appreciate their long and close identification with the land of their birth but almost paradoxically in the process of learning this lesson they have also become aware of their own uniqueness today the informed negro no longer denies his past or his color for he is aware of the pluralistic manysided nature of his countrys culture america is woven of many strands writes ralph ellison in the invisible man our fate is to become one and yet many this is not prophecy but description remembering denmark vesey by sterling stuckey n a slave named denmark vesey won a lottery and purchased his freedom from his master twentytwo years later in charleston south carolina he was arrested interrogated and sent to the gallows for having led a conspiracy against slavery involving thousands of slaves inspired by the vesey example black abolitionists used it on a number of occasions to exhort the slaves to sunder their bonds henry highland garnett in an address in at buffalo new york called for a rebellion on the part of slaves reminding them that denmark vesey had shaken the whole empire of slavery later during the civil war frederick douglass urged the slaves to take up arms to remember denmark vesey of charleston moreover civil_rights partisans invoked the spirit of vesey on numerous occasions in the latter part of the th century to strengthen the will of their followers in face of fierce overwhelming odds since the death of vesey chroniclers of the slave era have referred to his conspiracy as one of the most extensive and ingeniously planned of all slave plots and its validity has been attested by contemporaries and historians alike indeed there was general agreement on the existence of a fullscale plot by vesey until richard c wade of the university of chicago raised serious questions regarding the entire incident and called for reconsideration professor wade has advanced the view that there is persuasive evidence that no conspiracy in fact existed that at the most it was a vague and unformulated plan in the minds or on the tongues of a few colored townsmen wade in a recently published book slavery in the cities again challenged the veracity of the usual historical accounts of the conspiracy asserting that the plot was probably never more than loose talk by aggrieved and embittered men some of the details concerning the events which threw the city of charleston into a state of great unrest during the summer of are likely to remain forever clothed in obscurity nevertheless a reconstruction of the broad outline of developments which caused the defenders of slavery to seek certain retribution against scores of slaves is possible by recounting those developments as viewed for more than a century by those who have studied the vesey incident we hope to provide a historical screen against which wades charges can be projected for purposes of more meaningful scrutiny on may devany the slave of john c prioleau was standing alongside the fitzsimmons fish wharf in charleston gazing out to sea he was accosted by william paul the slave of messrs j and d paul the pauls slave drew devany into conversation asking him if he knew that something serious was about to happen devany answering that he did not was told that the slaves were determined to do something about their condition to rise up against slavery in great numbers in order to right themselves devany frightened by this startling disclosure carried the intelligence to his master which precipitated the arrest of paul other slaves peter poyas and mingo harthwere later implicated by paul who had begun to fear for his life but poyas and harth displayed such coolness when questioned that they were released william paul however was placed in solitary confinement within a week he divulged more names stated that the plot was one of extensive proportions and that its object was the massacre of whites but at least one of the men ned bennett immediately came forth of his own volition and asked to be questioned if he was suspected a move which served to perplex the authorities more than ever especially since bennett was the governors slave vesey was not idle while these proceedings were taking place upon the arrest of peter poyas john lofton has written veseyfearing that the plan would be frustrated if its execution were delayed until july as originally scheduledhad advanced the date to june meanwhile a white resident of charleston major john wilson having heard about the plot enlisted the aid of one of his mothers slaves a blacksmith prominent in negro church affairs george wilson on friday june startling information was revealed to the blacksmith by a member of his church class he was told that not a moment should be lost informing the authorities since the outbreak was scheduled to begin at midnight on sunday june george wilson dutifully reported this information to the major notified of this new development the authorities moved with dispatch governor thomas bennett began to shore up the military resources of the city by ordering the quartermaster general of militia to place in the citys arsenal ball cartridges and to prepare muskets for delivery john hope franklin referring to the state of panic toward which charleston was moving at this time has observed all kinds of military groups were called into service a person unfamiliar with the problem doubtless would have thought that such extentive mobilization was for the purpose of meeting some foreign foe the neck rangers the charleston riflemen the light infantry and the corps of hussars were some of the established military groups called up a special city guard of one hundred and fifty troops was provided for charleston only the authorities and those involved in the plot knew that a rebellion was scheduled to take place within two days the whole was concealed said the governor until the time came but secret preparations were made saturday night and sunday morning passed without demonstrations doubts were excited and counter orders were issued for diminishing the guard due to the unusual activity among the militia it was borne in upon vesey and his coconspirators that the defenders of slavery had been forewarned that theyvesey and his followerscould no longer expect to avail themselves of the element of surprise though twenty or thirty of his country followers reached the city on sunday morning june vesey still clinging to the hope that he could lead them in an uprising ordered them to disperse and wait for further orders as if to reinforce his leaders hope bacchus the slave of benjamin hamet brought to veseys houseon sunday nighta sword as well as a pistol which he had stolen from his master rumors of the projected uprising had by this time already reached the citizenry as lofton stated in his book there was great excitement among the whites that evening the streets were filled until a late hour with persons who were uncertain whether it was safe to retire even children were allowed to remain up at the appointed hour of p m the extra military units took up their stations although their size had been ordered reduced somewhat as a result of the noticeable lack of activity among the slaves a night of sleepless anxiety in the white community followed the sixteenth of june passed on the eighteenth ten suspicious slaves were arrested a development which sounded the plots deathknell for the investigation soon revealed a free negro named denmark vesey as the leader of the enterpriseamong his chief coadjutors being that innocent peter and that unsuspecting mingo who had been examined and discharged nearly three weeks before as quoted from travelers and outlaws as tension mounted vesey who had managed to elude his pursuers for three days was arrested and brought to trial on june the day following his arrest less than two weeks later he and five other negroes were taken to the edge of the city the trap door was sprung and the bodies of the six were left suspended over the gallows wade writes the uprising now seemed quashed but as word of it spread in the city public shock turned into hysteria no master could be sure his bondsmen were not involved whites who owned no slaves had little more assurance every negro became a possible enemy indeed assassin every action by a black could be construed as a prelude to violence since slaves lived in the same yard with their masters it was not even possible to lock out the intruder considering the details of the original plot as disclosed by witnesses as the trials proceeded it is small wonder that passions were roused to the point of hysteria lofton basing his account of the conspirators original plans on the evidence as recorded and believed by the court has described the dark stratagems of vesey and his men some slaves drawn from the countryside as well as the city were simultaneously to march at midnightarmed with pikes daggers swords bayonets scythes and a few pistolsupon the u s arsenal the governors mansion the main guardhouse and a number of other points of the city they were then to fire the city and liquidate not only whites but those blacks who did not join no oneneither children nor women nor ministers of the gospelwould be spared from late june until the th of july over cases were heard by the court the number arrested h m henry has recorded was of whom were convicted the number executed was all slaves except vesey number deported among the leaders brought to trial only onemonday gelladmitted involvement in a conspiracy against slavery the other principals maintained that they were innocent throughout july slaves were being executed on one occasion twentytwo were executed at once left dangling above the long gallows in full view of the populace the relatives of those hanged were not even allowed to bury their dead as the authorities regarded the bodies of slaves even in death as property on request the bodies of the executed men were turned over to surgeons for purposes of dissection according to lofton in insurrection in south carolina the vengeance of the slavocracy with this singular act had all but spent itself though a few more hangings followed in its wake in late summer the cry went up for the banishment of all free negroes from the state the deed had been done it remained for posterity to interpret it the above account of the vesey plot is representative of the views of the great majority of scholars who have described the insurrection indeed until recently the scope and existence of the plot have gone unquestioned even ulrich b phillips who was quick to seize upon the alleged submissive nature of the slave and turn such an attribute against the negros claim to full manhood rights never questioned the existence of the plot asserting that the vesey plot was elaborate phillips further remarks in a chapter entitled slave crimes that the conspiracy is one of the most notable of such episodes on record herbert aptheker characterizes the incident as one of the most serious widespread and carefully planned conspiracies in addition he describes vesey as a master of several languages who couched his appeals to the rights of man in both theological and secular terms louis filler observes that the vesey insurrection horrified southerners by its scope the audacity of its leaders and the close relationship it revealed between slave and free negroes and kenneth stampp refers to veseys vast conspiracy which came to nothing after it was given away by a slave this brings us back to professor wades analysis of the conspiracy which led him to conclude that no such fullscale plot in fact took place that at the most it was a vague unformulated plan in the minds or on the tongues of a few colored townsmenitalics added wades reconsideration of the vesey plot must on any showing be taken seriously for it raises serious questions with regard to all preceding interpretations of the plot wade contends that essential facts about the vesey uprising that have been generally accepted by historians are open to question because historians have relied on an official version published by the city in which provided the only available facts facts which in his view do not square with the original account of the case moreover he argues that a close reading of the two versions will show that the original transcript was doctored and that historians generally have focused on the broader meaning of the conspiracy as it related to resistance of negroes to the institution of slavery wade in questioning the existence of the plot relies to a considerable extent on letters written by a respected judge who raised questions concerning the effects of popular excitement upon the trials and letters written by the daughter of the judge whose mood ranged from frenzy to skepticism from great certitude concerning the enormity of the plot to concern over the lengths to which the court had gone in punishing the accused the daughter ann hayes johnson remarked at one point as quoted by wade that south carolinians were possessed of impetuosity and ardency of feeling which unavoidably lays them open to deception and consequently leads them on to error in action but wade does not assert that either judge johnson or his daughter denied the existence of a plot rather he suggests that they were concerned over procedures followed and punishment exacted alluding to doubts expressed by governor thomas bennett wade challenges the published record of the trial at a number of important points though he admits that the governor probably believed in a plot of some kind wade quotes at length from the governors message given to the senate and house of representatives of the state of south carolina on november pointing out that the governor questioned the secrecy surrounding the trial the method of gathering testimony by the judges the reliability of testimony concerning the nature of the plot the disparity between the enormous scope of the plot and the meager resources of the rebels and the belief that the leaders of the plot were acting in concert in examining the points raised by the governor wade questions the involvement of an alleged conspirators basing his doubt on the fact that no roster of names ever turned up since the plot supposedly involved slaves within a radius of to miles of charleston he remarks that the lack of activity in the rural sections cast doubt on the extensiveness of the conspiracy wade draws attention to ambiguities in the official record with respect to the matter of weapons and makes much of the fact that no cache of arms was found he points out that the confessions of two of the accused were edited in the published version of the trials which served to change the tone of the narrative in the same vein he cites the fact that the published account of the trial includes mention of a rebellion not even referred to in the original transcript in wades opinion the discrepancies seem deliberate since the printed version alleges that no facts would be suppressed and that the very words of the witnesses would be used the burden of wades argument then is that the authenticity of the printed version of the trial is in doubt that it contains enough questionable material to support the view that the object of the trial was not to discover the extent of the plot but rather to awe the negroes by a show of force the very atmosphere itself so charged with tension born of rumors emanating from both sides of the color line was especially congenial to a racial explosion when devany and william paul had their chance encounter on the wharf that day in late may the catalytic agent was introduced thus wade remarks charleston stumbled into tragedy how does wade account for the tenacity of the myth of vesey conspiring to lead thousands of alarms in a assault against the slavocracy opponents and apologists of slavery have since used the vesey incident he informs us as part of the ammunition of their respective arsenals either the incident was used as eloquent proof that the will to freedom is so natural a part of the human personality that none would remain passively enchained or as justification for the stringent laws against negroes during slavery no closer examination of the events of that sultry summer in seemed warranted since scholars were in argreement that the revolt had taken place the vesey uprising had become a convenient illustration of a larger view of bondage richard wade considers it of great moment that the leaders of the insurrection had little or no plan of action and with one exception proclaimed their innocence to the very end one is forced to wonder whether conspirators if involved in an expansive plot can reasonably be expected to admit guilt particularly as long as all of the leaders have not been detected and arrested higginson takes notice of the fact that the transcripts contain an admission on the part of the judges that they were unable to detect more than a small minority of those concerned in the conspiracy could it be that the vesey insurrectionists to the extent that they were successful in mounting a large conspiracy owed their success to iron discipline and to a vow not to reveal important information to the authorities higginson who spent weeks poring over the official reports in charleston offers a different view from that of professor wade as regards both the plan and the refusal of the men who designed it to declare themselves a party to the plot the details of the plan higginson writes were not rashly committed to the mass of the confederates they were known only to a few and were finally to be announced only after the evening prayer meetings on the appointed sunday vesey showed great penetration says lofton and sound judgment in the selection of his leaders the small number convicted in comparison to the number of negroes reported to be involved seems to have been due to a determination on the part of the leaders to meet their fate without talking portions of the official reports not cited by wade perhaps go far toward explaining the refusal of most of the leaders to enter a plea of guilty rolla is described as a man who was remarkable for great presence and composure of mind one who exhibited no signs of fear ned was stern and immovable even when receiving the sentence of death in peters countenance were strongly marked disappointed ambition revenge indignation and an anxiety to know how far the discoveries had extended italics added to quote higginson he is said to have responded with a cryptic smile when asked whether he really wanted to see his kindly master murdered vesey addressed witnesses in an imperious manner and argued his case with great art and plausibility wades charge that the reports fail to mention the discovery of a large cache of arms however must be reckoned with by those historians who assume that the arms had either been fashioned or secured for use higginson takes a different view of governor bennetts attitude toward the court proceedings than that taken by wade who relies heavily on the governors charge of excessive punishment and contends that the governor probably did not take the description of the plot provided by the city very seriously higginson offers the view that the governors attitude was colored by a desire to smooth the thing over for the credit and safety of the city he contrasts the governors evasive tone with the frank and thorough statements of the judges if a few people like the governor doubted the enormity of the plot higginson avers the judges seem to admit that had the whole thing been brought to a head the slaves generally would have joined in lofton seems to support wades position that the governor was motivated by a sincere concern over the harsh punishment which was meted out to the insurrectionists he does point out that the governor was also concerned about securing the release of his own slaves a most curious feature of professor wades piece on the vesey plot is the scanty information provided concerning the dramatis personae italics added despite the fact that considerable information regarding each leader of the insurrection is available wade in the main fails to incorporate this material into his assessment he does not mention for example the fact that vesey though a fairly prosperous artisan had every reason to hate slavery especially since he had fathered many children by slave mothers considering the fact that the children and their mothers were doomed to a lifetime of slavery it is not difficult to conceive of vesey wanting to war against that institution his temper according to the court was impetuous and domineering in the extreme qualifying him for the despotic rule of which he was ambitious at another point the record reveals that many negroes feared him more than their owners and one of them declared even more than god no ordinary man vesey appears to have been a man possessing charismatic authority most historians who have written at length on the vesey insurrection have recounted much on the life of peter poyas who was said to be veseys chief lieutenant but all wade tells us is that poyas had an excellent reputation and the implicit confidence of his master in addition to being a firstrate artisan at no time does wade come to grips with the incident with which many writers have most often identified poyas his exhortation to the slaves to not open your lips die silent as you shall see me do as quoted in john lofton negro insurrectionist antioch review xviii summer higginson reports that poyas was said to have a magnetism in his eye of which his confederates stood in great awe if he once got his eye upon a man there was no resisting it it has also been remarked that poyas when on the gallows repeated his charge of secrecy do not open your lips die silent as you shall see me do on another occasion according to a witness poyas was chained to the floor of his cell with another conspirator when the men in authority came to exhort the names of the men conspiring with the two slaves poyas is said to have leaned upon his elbow looked at the man lying beside him urging quietly die like a man and then lay down again it has been observed that he was obeyed but there is no mention of these remarks in the wade piece other members of the upper echelons of leadership were scarcely less impressive the transcript the original and published versions pay tribute to the abilities and disciplined natures of the men selected by vesey to join in the uprising it should not go unremarked that according to the court vesey and his men had been planning the revolt for close to four years before they were betrayed for a small group of embittered and aggrieved men to have kept such a plan a secret for that length of time appears to be an eloquent testament to their extraordinary conspiratorial propensities such men it seems would not be likely to yield easily to pressure wades charge that not a single roster of names was uncovered stands as one not easily answered given the information provided by his article but when vital portions of the transcript not mentioned by wade are quoted and discussed by lofton higginson and others such as detailed information concerning the personalities and activities of leaders of the plotthen even wades charge regarding the roster of names appears to lose some of its force one might reason bearing in mind what is known about poyas vesey and other prominent figures of the incident that as soon as poyas and mingo harth were released from jail after their first arrest all rosters of names were probably destroyed for at that time all of the leaders were still at large still free to dispose of evidence that would most assuredly not only seal their doom but compromise every member of the plot from the city to the countryside since according to the court each leader kept to himself the names of his proselytes the destruction of rosters of names would indeed be a simple act to perform wade in questioning the extensiveness of the plot says that some of the accused when confronted with each other didnt even appear to know each other perhaps the decision among the leaders to prepare and keep their own rosters explains this in addition such a decision on the part of the leaders might indicate that the plot was a large rather than small one wades contention that the published version of the proceedings of the court varied significantly from the original account seems to be unassailable he and thomas hamilton are evidently the only historians to point out this discrepancy wade demonstrates that evidence in the original transcript was suppressed it should be recalled however that the suppression of information concerning slave revolts in the south was not confined to the vesey case alone according to margaret just butchers the negro in american culture accounts of innumerable slave revolts were suppressed as much as possible but wades position here seems to be well taken for the officials appeared to be suppressing portions of the transcript which might weaken the case for a fair trial having taken place additional information found in the published transcript does seem to clear up as he points out certain questionable features of the original there seems to be little question but that there were irregularities in the manner in which the proceedings of the court were conducted but courts in the south during antebellum days and even now were not noted for protecting the rights of negroes especially when the rights to be protected belonged to men allegedly involved in a conspiracy to overthrow slavery herbert aptheker makes it quite clear that south carolina laws were designed to protect the interests of the masters not the rights of their slaves or former slaves the fundamental principle of all relationships between the slave and society according to antislavery by dumond was that the slave was subject to control but was not entitled to protection italics added thus south carolina was not alone in fashioning laws to govern slaves that were at variance with those used to establish legal relations among whites by not pointing out these characteristic irregularities wade leaves the impression that charleston officials went to extraordinary lengths to frame vesey and those arrested with him which is quite a different thing from being indifferent with regard to the legal rights of the accused it would have been far more instructive had wade placed his discussion of the vesey plot in the broader context of slavery as an institution had he done so it is possibleeven probablethat his case would have been appreciably weakened for just as carolinians were not unique in their handling of slave legal cases neither were they different from others in inflicting upon slaves punishment quite disproportionate to the offense intended or committed the reactions of the proslavery elements in virginia during and following the gabriel and turner revolts certainly were at the very least equal to the harsh behavior of the authorities responsible for the brutal mass hangings of the vesey conspirators according to kenneth stampp it is worth noting as regards the gabriel conspiracy that though there was no question of the guilt of the slaves involved the leaders when arrested behaved in a manner strikingly similar to that of vesey poyas and the other principals of the vesey plot though gabriel and his followers took to the field to battle for their freedom they were willing to reveal little or nothing concerning their plans james monroe then governor of virginia said of gabriel from what he said to me he seemed to have made up his mind to die and to have resolved to say but little on the subject of the conspiracy as quoted by herbert aptheker in american negro slave revolts is it not possible that vesey poyas harth and others associated with vesey were simply using tactics similar to those used by gabriel and his colleagues the authorities as in the vesey case were never able to determine the number of men involved in gabriels conspiracy and there was that same secrecy prior to the revolt among gabriel and his tough band that the authorities have attributed to the men who allegedly conspired to wreck charleston indeed the gabriel plan for revolt was kept with incredible secrecy for quite some time in the view of one high official in virginia given the character of vesey and the men around him especially when considering what happened in virginia in it is not unlikely that they had conceived and long nourished a plan that went beyond the loose talk stage whether innocent or guilty ordinary men would one would think quake at the thought of facing the gallows considering the racial atmosphere of the antebellum south is it not extraordinary that most of the ring leaders in question behaved as they did displaying levity in some instances scorn in others and no fear throughout the proceedings professor wade closes his discussion of the vesey plot with the observation that the men accused of having led a conspiracy in charleston were not likely prospects for such a scheme this conclusion is based on his theory that slaves in cities being better off than imbruted field hands were not as likely to revolt he wrote this apparent freedom deflected the discontent leading negroes to try to exploit their modest advantages rather than to organize for desperate measures as regards wades above statement together with his contention that a concerted revolt against slavery was actually less likely in a city than in a countryside stanley elkins is in sharp disagreement in slavery a problem in american institutional and intellectual life he writes it is of great interest to note that although the danger of slave revolts like communist conspiracies in our own daywas much overrated by touchy southerners the revolts that actually did occur were in no instance planned by plantation laborers but rather by negroes whose qualities of leadership were developed well outside the full coercions of the plantation authoritysystem gabriel who led the revolt of was a blacksmith who lived a few miles outside richmond denmark vesey leading spirit of the plot at charleston was a freed negro artisan who had been born in africa and served several years aboard a slavetrading vessel and nat turner the virginia slave who fomented the massacre of was a literate preacher of recognized intelligence of the plots that have been convincingly substantiated whether they came to anything or not the majority originated in urban centers italics added it could well be as the experiences of gabriel and turner demonstrate that the greater the amount of freedom extended to sensitive negro victims of oppression the more not less they wanted to shatter all restrictions placed upon them was this true of vesey did he seek to right himself and other negroes by leading a vast conspiracy to these questions thanks to the probing work of wade future historians are not likely to offer the facile answers of historians who preceded them nor are they likely to remember the incident in quite the same way what appears to be no less certain is that the evidence when taken as a whole will probably suggest to them as it has to generations of scholars that denmark vesey did lead a conspiracy in charleston south carolina veseys example must be regarded as one of the most courageous ever to threaten the racist foundation of america in him the anguish of

glad to hear that manny had fallen off the roof i had put out the tale that i was down with yellow fever but nobody paid me no mind least of all dirty red who stomped right in to announce that manny had fallen off the roof and that i could come out of hiding now my mother dropped what she was doing which was the laundry and got the whole story out of red bad enough you gots to hang around with boys she said but fight with them too and you would pick the craziest one at that manny was supposed to be crazy that was his story to say you were bad put some people off but to say you were crazywell you were officially not to be messed with so that was his story on the other hand after i called him what i called him and said a few choice things about his mother his face did go through some piercing changes and i did kind of wonder if maybe he sure was nuts i didnt wait to find out i got in the wind and then he waited for me on my stoop all day and all night not hardly speaking to the people going in and out and he was there all day saturday with his sister bringing him peanut butter sandwiches and cream sodas he mustve gone to the bathroom right there cause everytime i looked out the kitchen window there he was and sunday too i got to thinking the boy was mad you got no sense of humor thats your trouble i told him he looked up but he didnt say nothing all at once i was real sorry about the whole thing i shouldve settled for hitting off the little girls in the school yard or waiting for frankie to come in so we could raise some kind of hell this way i had to play sick when my mother was around cause my father had already taken away my bb gun and hid it i dont know how they got manny on the roof finally maybe the wakefield kids the ones who keep the pigeons called him up manny was a sucker for sick animals and things like that or maybe frankie got some nasty girls to go up on the roof with him and got manny to join him i dont know anyway the cat walk had lost all its cement and the roof always did kind of slant downward so manny fell off the roof i got over my yellow fever right quick needless to say and ventured outside but by this time i had already told miss rose that crazy manny was after me and miss rose being who she was quite naturally went over to mannys house and said a few harsh words to his mother who being who she was chased miss rose out into the street and they commenced to get with it snatching bottles out of the garbage cans and breaking them on the johnny pumps and stuff like that dirty red didnt have to tell us about this everybody could see and hear all i never figured the garbage cans for an arsenal but miss rose came up with sticks and table legs and things and mannys mother had her share of scissor blades and bicycle chains they got to rolling in the streets and all you could see was pink drawers and fat legs it was something else miss rose is nutty but mannys mothers crazier than manny they were at it a couple of times during my sick spell everyone would congregate on the window sills or the fireescape commenting that it was still much too cold for this kind of nonsense but they watched anyway and then manny fell off the roof and that was that miss rose went back to her dream books and mannys mother went back to her tumbleddown kitchen of dirty clothes and bundles and bundles of rags and children my father got in on it too cause he happened to ask manny one night why he was sitting on the stoop like that every night manny told him right off that he was going to kill me first chance he got quite naturally this made my father a little warm me being his only daughter and planning to become a doctor and take care of him in his old age so he had a few words with manny first and then he got hold of the older brother bernard who was more his size bernard didnt see how any of it was his business or my fathers business so my father got mad and jammed bernards head into the mailbox then my father started getting messages from bernards uncle about where to meet him for a showdown and all my father didnt say a word to my mother all this time just sat around mumbling and picking up the phone and putting it down or grabbing my stickball bat and putting it back he carried on like this for days till i thought i would scream if the yellow fever didnt have me so weak and then manny fell off the roof and my father went back to his beer drinking buddies i was in the school yard pitching pennies with the little boys from the elementary school when my friend violet hits my brand new spaulding over the wall she came running back to tell me that manny was coming down the block i peeked beyond the fence and there he was alright he had his head all wound up like a mummy and his arm in a sling and his leg in a cast it looked phoney to me especially that walking cane i figured dirty red had told me a tale just to get me out there so manny could stomp me and manny was playing it up with costume and all till he could get me what happened to him violets sisters whispered but i was too busy trying to figure out how this act was supposed to work then manny passed real close to the fence and gave me a look you had enough hammer head i yelled just bring your crummy self in this yard and ill pick up where i left off violet was knocked out and the other kids went into a huddle i didnt have to say anything else and when they all pressed me later i just saidyou know that hammer he always carries in his fatigues and theyd all nod waiting for the rest of a long story well i took it away from him and i walked off nonchalantly manny stayed indoors for a long time i almost forgot about him new kids moved into the block and i got all caught up with that and then miss rose finally hit the numbers and started ordering a whole lot of stuff through the mail and we would sit on the curb and watch these weird looking packages being carried in trying to figure out what simpleminded thing she had thrown her money away on when she might just as well wait for the warm weather and throw a block party for all her godchildren after a while a center opened up and my mother said shed increase my allowance if i went and joined because id have to get out of my pants and stay in skirts on account of thats the way things were at the center so i joined and got to thinking about everything else but old hammer head it was a rough place to get along in the center but my mother said that i needed to be bed with and she needed to not be with me so i went and that time i sneaked into the office thats when i really got turned on i looked into one of those notquitewhite folders and saw that i was from a deviant family in a deviant neighborhood i showed my mother the word in the dictionary but she didnt pay me no mind it was my favorite word after that i ran it in the ground till one day my father got the strap just to show how deviant he could get so i gave up trying to improve my vocabulary and i almost gave up my dungarees then one night im walking pass the douglas street park cause i got thrown out of the center for playing pool when i shouldve been sewing even though i had already decided that this was going to be my last fling with boy things and starting tomorrow i was going to fix my hair right and wear skirts all the time just so my mother would stop talking about her gray hairs and miss rose would stop calling me by my brothers name by mistake so im walking pass the park and theres ole manny on the basketball court perfecting his layups and talking with himself being me i quite naturally walk right up and ask what the hell hes doing playing in the dark and he looks up and all around like the dark had crept up on him when he wasnt looking so i knew right away that hed been out there for a long time with his eyes just going along with the program there was two seconds to go and we were one point behind he said shaking his head and staring at his sneakers like they was somebody and i was in the clear id left the men in the back court and there i was smiling you dig cause it was in the bag they passed the ball and i slid the ball up nice and easy cause there was nothing to worry about and he shook his head i muffed the goddam shot ball bounced off the rim and he stared at his hands the game of the season last game and then he ignored me altogether though he wasnt talking to me in the first place he went back to the layups always from the same spot with his arms crooked in the same way over and over i mustve gotten hypnotized cause i probably stood there for at least an hour watching like a fool till i couldnt even see the damn ball much less the basket but l stood there anyway for no reason i know of he never missed but he cursed himself anyway it was torture and then a squad car pulled up and a short cop with hair like one of the marx brothers came out hitching up his pants he looked real hard at me and then at manny what are you two doing hes doing a layup im watching i said with my smart self then the cop just stood there and finally turned to the other one who was just getting out of the car who unlocked the gate the big one said its always unlocked i said then we three just stood there like a bunch of penguins watching manny go at it this on the level the big guy asked tilting his hat back with the thumb the way big guys do in hot weather hey you he said walking over to manny im talking to you he finally grabbed the ball to get mannys attention but that didnt work manny just stood there with his arms out waiting for the pass so he could save the game he wasnt paying no mind to the cop so quite naturally when the cop slapped him up side his head it was a surprise and when the cop started counting three to go manny had already recovered from the slap and was just ticking off the seconds before the buzzer sounded and all was lost gimme the ball man mannys face was all tightened up and ready to pop did you hear what i said black boy now when somebody says that word i gets warm and crazy or no crazy manny was my brother at that moment and the cop was the enemy you better give him back his ball i said manny dont take no mess from no cops he aint bothering nobody hes gonna be mister basketball when he grows up just trying to get a little practice in before the softball season starts look here sister well run you in too harpo said i damn sure cant be your sister seeing how im a black girl boy i sure will be glad when you run me in so i can tell everybody about that you must think youre in the south mister the big guy screwed his mouth up and let out one of them hardday sighs the parks closed little girl so why dont you and your boyfriend go on home that really got me the little girl was bad enough but that boyfriend was too much but i kept cool mostly because manny looked so pitiful waiting there with his hands in a timeout and there being no one to stop the clock but i kept my cool mostly cause of that hammer in mannys pocket and no telling how frantic things can get what with a bigmouth like me a couple of wise cops and a crazy boy too the gates are open i said real quiet like and this heres a free country so why dont you give him back his ball the big cop did another one of those sighs his specialty i guess and then he bounced the ball to manny who went right into this gliding thing clear up to the backboard damn near like he was some kind of very beautiful bird and then he swooshed that ball in even if there was no net and you couldnt really hear the swoosh something happened to the bones in my chest it was something crazy kids anyhow the one with the wig said and turned to go but the big guy watched manny for a while and i guess something mustve snapped in his head cause all of sudden he was hot for taking manny to jail or court or somewhere and started yelling at him and everything which is a bad thing to do to manny i can tell you and im standing there thinking none of my teachers from kindergarten right on up none of them knew what they were talking about ill be damned if i ever knew one of them rosycheeked cops that smiled and helped you get to school without neither you or your little raggedy dog getting hit by a truck that had a smile on its face too not that i ever believed it i knew dick and jane was full of crap from the get go especially them cops like this dude for example pulling on mannys clothes like that when obviously he had just done about the most beautiful thing a man can do and not be a fag no cop could swoosh without a net look out man was all manny said but it was the way he pushed the cop that started the real yelling and threats and i thought to myself oh god here i am trying to change my ways and not talk back in school and do like my mother wants but just have this last fling and now thisgetting shot in the stomach and bleeding to death in douglas street park and poor manny getting pistolwhipped by those bastards and what not i could see it all practically crying too and it just wasnt no kind of thing to happen to a small child like me with my confirmation picture in the paper next to my weeping parents and school mates i could feel the blood sticking to my shirt and my eyeballs slipping away and then that confirmation picture again and my mother and her gray hair and miss rose heading for the precinct with a shotgun and my father getting old and feeble with no one to doctor him up and all and i wished manny had fallen off the damn roof and died right then and there and saved me all this aggravation of being killed with him by these cops who surely didnt come out of no fifth grade reader but it didnt happen they just took the ball and manny followed them real quiet like right out of the park into the dark then into the squad car with his head drooping and his arms in a crook and i went on home cause what the hell am i going to do on a basketball court and it getting to be nearly midnight i didnt see manny no more after he got into that squad car but they didnt kill him after all cause miss rose heard he was in some kind of big house for people what lose their marbles and then it was spring finally and me and violet was in this very boss fashion show at the center and miss rose bought me my first corsageyellow roses to match my shoes the ssign by sam gf ieenlee t never got bad until we got in the cab and then it would get pro gressively worse iworse learned to just keep my mouth shut at first i would try to make things less tense by cracking jokes but it did no good we always took a cab into town the first two or three saturdays after payday i learned early that i could only stare at the rolling georgia countryside the red clay the pines tall and green in clusters and alone the bright sunshine even when the wind was biting and bitter outside i would stare and count the pines or the clouds or contrast the color combinations or do a number of other things to make the ride seem shorter and none of them worked we had both washed out of ocs for more or less the same reason we couldnt or wouldnt demonstrate that we were impressed enough by the prospect of being an officer in the u s army we were in different ocs companies and had gotten assigned to the same skeleton company of misfits like ourselves and had more or less migrated together it was a mutually gratifying relationship handy because misfits are unwelcome things in the army and they let you know it we found that we had much in common we liked modern literature hemingway for myself and he was a faulkner man hed read sartre and gide and camus in the original we would argue for hours picasso braque the german expressionists the impressionists i taught him how to hook and jab to slip a punch he taught me chess moves i showed him the insides of jazz the blues and where they came from bessie smith and lady day bird and diz he passed along what he knew about the classics we bought a portable phonograph with the first winnings in the payday game sent home for our records and spent hours after duty in the barracks listening pushing the barracks sounds into the background it was like this with the poker game i like poker but i could never take it seriously enough to be as good as i could be at least that was toms analysis tom was a real prohe lost now and then anyone who doesnt cheat loses but he wins a lot more often than he loses we decided to pool a given amount each payday and he would play that and no more as an investment if we lost we always had enough between us to make it into town for at least one fair weekend and to make it through the month on a modified austerity program if we won as was usual we could live it up saturdays were always the best and when we went into town they were also the worst during the week we might play basketball after chow or chess or go to a movie or wander over to the library to see what they had that was new or just chew the fat saturdays we had inspection and the rest of the day was ours we would sit around listening to the music that was almost drowned out by the gis getting ready for a big night sprawled on the bunks while they went through the frenetic frantic ritual of getting ready for the trip to town we would wait taking it easy and untouched by the chaos until the barracks was cleared and then shower and shave with the latrine all to ourselves wed stroll down to the nco club and have a steak with red wine after a couple of martinis coffee and cognac maybe a cigar and think about later that night tom divided his time between a schoolteacher and a secretary he might have had more he is a very good looking guy tall and blonde with an easy laugh and line i had a doctors receptionist with an apartment of her own then we would get up and go outside and get into a cab and then it would start tom would get quiet and tense the silence would seem to get heavier as we moved through the red clay countryside tom staring at nothing his lips thin and tight and me looking out the window and seeing very little he seemed to get smaller and more wound up the closer we got to town chain smoking in the comer as we hit first the row of pawn shops and easyloan offices on the edge of town and then the good looking suburban homes and moved into the city itself id sit in the other corner trying to look relaxed and at ease sure i wasnt doing a very good job and knowing it didnt matter much because tom wasnt seeing much just sitting and smoking and staring we would pull up to the movie and id pay the cabbie and buy the tickets and we would walk into the lobby and id give the tickets to the man at the door and we would walk into the inner lobby and tom would go through the doors ahead and i would turn at the sign over the stairs and walk up to the balcony the sign a very pretty thing in red and gold said colored why i eulogized malcolm_x by ossie davis are not the only person curious to know why i y j would eulogize a man like malcolm_x many who w know and respect me have written letters of these letters i am proudest of those from a sixthgrade class of young white boys and girls who asked me to explain i appreciate your giving me this chance to do so you may anticipate my defense somewhat by considering the following fact no negro has yet asked me that question my pastor in grace baptist church where i teach sunday school preached a sermon about malcolm in which he called him a giant in a sick world every one of the many letters i got from my own people lauded malcolm as a man and commended me for having spoken at his funeral at the same timeand this is importantmost all of them took special pains to disagree with much or all of what malcolm said and what he stood for that is with one singing exception they all every last black gloryhugging one of them knew that malcolmwhatever else he was or was not malcolm was a man white folks do not need anybody to remind them that they are men we do this was his one incontrovertible benefit to his protocol and common sense require that negroes stand back and let the white man speak up for us defend us and lead us from behind the scene in our fight this is the essence of negro politics but malcolm said to hell with that get up off your knees and fight your own battles thats the way to win back your selfrespect thats the way to make the white man respect you and if he wont let you live like a man he certainly cant keep you from dying like one malcolm as you can see was refreshing excitement he scared hell out of the rest of us bred as we are to caution to hypocrisy in the presence of white folks to the smile that never fades malcolm knew that every white man in america profits directly or indirectly from his position visavis negroes profits from racism even though he does not practice it or believe it he also knew that every negro who did not challenge on the spot every instance of racism overt or covert committed against him and his people who chose instead to swallow his spit and go on smiling was an uncle tom and a traitor without balls or guts or any other commonly accepted aspects of manhood now we knew all these things as well as malcolm did but we also knew what happened to people who stick their necks out and say them and if all the lies we tell ourselves by way of extenuation were put into print it would constitute one of the great chapters in the history of mans justifiable cowardice in the face of other men but malcolm kept snatching our lies away he kept shouting the painful truth we whites and blacks did not want to hear from all the housetops and he wouldnt stop for love nor money you can imagine what a howling shocking nuisance this man was to both negroes and whites once malcolm fastened on you you could not escape he was one of the most fascinating and charming men i have ever met and never hesitated to take his attractiveness and beat you to death with it yet his irritation though painful to us was most salutary he would make you angry as hell but he would also make you proud it was impossible to remain defensive and apologetic about being a negro in his presence he wouldnt let you and you always left his presence with the sneaky suspicion that maybe after all you were a man but in explaining malcolm let me take care not to explain him away he had been a criminal an addict a pimp and a prisoner a racist and a hater he had really believed the white man was a devil but all this had changed two days before his death in commenting to gordon parks about his past life he said that was a mad scene the sickness and madness of those days im glad to be free of them malcolm_x continued and malcolm was free no one who knew him before and after his trip to mecca could doubt that he had completely abandoned racism separatism and hatred but he had not abandoned his shockeffect statements his bristling agitation for immediate freedom in this country not only for blacks but for everybody and most of all in the area of race relations he still delighted in twisting the white mans tail and in making uncle toms compromisers and accommodationistsi deliberately include myself thoroughly ashamed of the urbane and smiling hypocrisy we practice merely to exist in a world whose values we both envy and despise but even had malcolm not changed he would still have been a relevant figure on the american scene standing in relation as he does to the responsible civil_rights leaders just about where john brown stood in relation to the responsible abolitionist in the fight against slavery almost all disagreed with browns mad and fanatical tactics which led him foolishly to attack a federal arsenal at harpers ferry to lose two sons there and later to be hanged for treason i yet today the world and especially the negro people proclaim i brown not a traitor but a hero and a martyr in a noble cause so i in future i will not be surprised if men come to see that malcolm_x was within his own limitations and in his own inimitable style also a martyr in that cause but there is much controversy still about this most controversial american and i am content to wait for history to make the final decision but in personal judgment there is no appeal from instinct i knew the man personally and however much i disagreed with him i never doubted that malcolm_x even when he was wrong was always that rarest thing in the world among us negroes a true man and if to protect my relations with the many good white folks who make it possible for me to earn a fairly good living in the entertainment industry i was too chicken too cautious to admit that fact when he was alive i thought at least that now when all the white folks are safe from him at last i could be honest with myself enough to lift my hat for one final salute to that brave black ironic gallantry which was his style and hallmark that shocking zing of fireandbedamnedtoyou so absolutely absent in every other negro man i know which brought him too soon to his death the breaking the bond by lerone bennett jr is about to begin v black men and white men are going to meet for the first a c a if m time in the womb of an american setting v look far off on the horizon is a tiny speck the speck grows larger turns lists and bobbles on the atlantic waves there is a cry a ship a ship on shore and men dash to the waterfront and peer through the late summer haze to the bored and homesick settlers of jamestown virginia the approaching ship is a godsend jamestown the first english settlement in america is a miserable little hole with a handful of huts and almost no diversion the ship heaving into view promises excitement and adventure but there is no way for the men on shore to know how much excitement the ship really contains for in the hold of this ship figuratively speaking is the whole vibrant panorama of negro america the blues and the spirituals booker t washington and martin_luther_king jr the twist and the charleston the bloody anger of gettysburg and the nagging promise of the fourteenth amendment the ship as befitting a messenger of fate is nameless there is an air of intrigue of danger even about the captain one mr jope who comes ashore with an elegant lie on his lips he has just robbed a spanish vessel of a cargo of africans bound for the west indies but he does not mention that he ptends john rolfe notes with suspicion that he is in great need of food and he offers to exchange his cargo for victualled the deal is arranged antonio isabella pedro and seventeen other africans with spanish names debark and an argument begins it is august years before emancipation years before the long hot summer of the question in august of as in august of was what shall we do with for to and about the black people it was a question that would be asked over and over again in the years to come and it would be answered over and over again as it was answered in the beginningwith a compromise it was decided in the summer of to hand the black people over to the colony instead of to individuals the twenty black seeds of jamestown were farmed out to various officials of the colonyand they were farmed out as servants and not slaves in court and church records the first black americans were listed as servants this is a point of immense significance in the history of america the first black immigrants were not slaves nor were the first white immigrants free most of the english colonists in the beginning were indentured servants that is they were sold or they sold themselves to the colony or to individual planters for a stipulated number of years five or seven or more to pay the price for their passage in virginia and other colonies the first black immigrants fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic pattern that carried no implications of racial inferiority during this transitional period of years or more a period of primary importance in the history of america the first negro immigrants mingled with whites on a basis of substantial equality history masks the faces and emotions of the black men and women who lived in this racial wonderland the record burns with their presence but the record is strangely silent on their reactions and the reactions of their white colleagues the black founding fathers enter history thus faceless men uprooted from the warm womb of mother africa and flung willynilly into the wilderness of an outpost of western civilization nothing on the record indicates that the shock was very great for negroes or whites the men and women of the black yeast soon dropped their entrancing spanish names antonio and isabella who were drawn to each other on the trip over married and became parents of the first negro child born in english america in the black boy was christened william tucker in a jamestown church thus in the span of a few years the negro soul moved from africa to spain to americafrom x to antonio to william within the next few years scores of africans made the leap by there were three hundred black folk in a population of about fifteen thousand some came directly from england where negroes had lived since others came from spain portugal and the west indies a large number of these pioneer migrants were christians baptized either in spain or england john phillip for example testified in a jamestown court in and his testimony against a white man was admitted because he had been christened in england twelve years since some perhaps all of the first group of africanamericans worked out their terms of servitude and were freed within a few years the more energetic were accumulating property pounds and indentured servants anthony johnson americas first black capitalist earned the dubious honor of being the first person in the colony to hold a negro as a servant for life still another negro richard johnson imported a white man and held him in servitude this apparently was integration with a vengeance but let us take care not to exaggerate it is as certain as death that there were racists then but the record indicates that some negroes were accorded social privileges about equal to those accorded to freed white servants more importantly negro freedmen seem to have had the same industrial and economic opportunities as white servants within the confines of this system which can only be called equality of repression negroes fared about as well as whites they held real property and transferred it sued in court and were sued some negroes voted and a few held the minor offices of beadle and surety in a limited sense then the jamestown experience was an open experience negroes were free to express themselves according to their personalities and their different lights they could live with white people if they wanted to or they could live without them and some negroes interestingly enough wanted to live without them on the banks of the pungoteague river in northampton county a handful of negroes established americas first harlem in anthony johnson imported five servants and received headrights a grant of so many acres per servant imported of two hundred acres along the pungoteague other johnsons and other negroes moved to the burgeoning development the settlement throve but not without a certain dissension the johnsons were a proud contentious folk and they were soon in court suing each other over infringements of contract or property the johnson settlement at its height included no more than a dozen or so negroes with very large holdings other negroes were scattered throughout the colony in integrated communities in benjamin doyle received a patent for three hundred acres in surrey county john harris in bought fifty acres in new kent county and phillip morgan with great optimism leased two hundred acres in york county for ninetynine years morgans optimism was not entirely groundless the bulk of the population at that time consisted of indentured servants who were remarkably free from racial prejudice whites and negroes worked in the same fields lived in the same huts and fraternized during offduty hours and predictably they mated and married there was widespread intermingling between negroes and whites throughout the colonial period colonial virginia peter fontaine said swarmed with mulatto children in this period little or no distinction was made between indentured servants and negro slaves and servants what little prejudice there was stemmed mostly from english class prejudice white servants and negro servants were assigned the same tasks and many masters held them in equal contempt it was not unusual in those days for a master to force a white woman servant to marry a negro nor was it unusual for negro servants to serve as overseers over negro and white work forces of particular interest in this context of developing community is the fact that white and negroes of the working class made common cause against the master class they often ran away together and in several communities they staged interracial revolts working together in the same fields sharing the same huts the same situation and the same hope the first negro and white americans aristocrats excepted developed strong bonds of sympathy and mutuality there was no barrier psychological or otherwise between them and circles of community and solidarity began to widen skin color had a meaning then but not the meaning it has now the basic division was between servants and free people and there were whites and negroes on both sides of the line one has to make an effort to grasp the contours of this world it seems somehow unamerican as undoubtedly it was since it has existed in america for only one brief spell and then by default a negro in this world could almost feel at home there was not the fatal split between being an american whatever that is and being a negro whatever that is if there was prejudice then and there was it was not organized and sustained by the intractable will of an entire community there was not in fact an agreedupon name for the phenomena to be excludedand names are indispensable for good exclusion the first negroes were called blackmoors moors negers and negars the word negro a derivative of spanish and portuguese forms did not come into general use until later by that time the reality it was supposed to denote had assumed cancerous proportions in mens minds but to repeat one must be careful not to idealize one suspects that even then negroes asked themselves in the closeness of their hearts who am i god and what one suspects that the first generation of black americans remembered the old gods and the old ways and moaned the plaintive cry of the exiled jew by the river of jordan they sat us down and said sing us a song but how can i sing the lords song in a strange land how indeed and which lord from the beginning there was a tenuous subtle pressure more menacing perhaps because it was shapeless and nameless the tension points then and now were sex and status then as now the thrust came from fear fear of self fear of the unknown fear of the differentfear and a monstrous fascination in a white man was denounced for lying with a negro woman which was said by the governing class to be an abuse to the dishonor of god and the shame of christians he was ordered soundly whipped before an assemblage of negroes it is a measure of the progress in civilization that ten years later the white man in a similar episode was ordered to do penance in church and the negro woman was soundly whipped sex continued to be a problem in the early colonies not to the servants who got on famously but to the aristocrats who were scandalized by the broad tolerance of the first englishwomen a system of intimidation was organized which increased in severity forty years after the jamestown landing white women were being whipped and sold into slavery or extended servitude for showing open preference for negro men the problem of sex was largely a problem of the negro male which is to say that it was a problem of power in the s and s which marked a slight shift in the relations between negroes and whites tentative restrictions were placed on the negro males in for example all colonists except negroes were required to arm themselves this restriction and others of similar weight and meaning were reflections of a mounting fear in the world of men to grasp the significance of this development one must first understand the world context in which it occurred the planting of black folk on american soil and their subsequent degradation were episodes in a worldwide drama the african slave trade the detailed story of the slave trade does not concern us here what does concern us is the extraordinary nature of the initial contacts between europeans and africans africa and europe in the fifteenth century were on the same level of toynbees vaulted precipice of glory in fact in some areas africans were a ledge or two ahead the sudanese empire with its worldfamous showplace of timbuctu had passed its peak but it could still show europe a thing or twothe university of sankore for example and intellectuals like es sadi who owned a private library of sixteen hundred volumes at a time when the whole of america was a howling wilderness nor was that all there were huge empires and populous citiessome as large as all but the largest european citiesalong the coast europeans noting these things greeted africans as allies and partners in trade the recorded reminiscences of traders show that down to the eighteenth century they had no conception of their victims as racial pariahs on the contrary many traders expressed a belief that africans were their equal and the superiors of many back home if europeans forgot their place there were africans in this period to remind them the first africans were rather contemptuous of european claims they did not in any wise consider themselves inferior if anything they considered themselves superior to the oddlooking men with pale skins the king of dahomey seldom shook hands with white men and when he did it was a very uncommon mark of royal condescension a french trader complained in that the fanti were so proud and haughty that a european trader there must stand bare to them standing up to each other as men and as equals both africans and europeans profited plenipotentiaries were exchanged and bright young men of the ruling classes went to lisbon and rome to study and observe black and white kings exchanged letters filled with terms of royal endearment my fellow brother and my fellow queen they also exchanged gifts and mistresses of various hues and dispositions shakespeares laudatory phrase i speak of africa and golden joys was not conjured up out of the air the phrase was solidly grounded in the realities of life in the first phase of the africaneuropean dialogue a dialogue consisting of trade in men and goods and ideas as in jamestown africans speedily absorbed the fundamentals of the european way of life on may one hundred years before the jamestown landing henry of the congo led a mission to the vatican formally addressed the pope in latin and was appointed bishop of the congo in rome lisbon and other european control centers africans rose to high positions in church and state and negro gametes were scattered throughout the populations of europe by the southern portion of portugal was predominantly negro and as far north as lisbon negroes outnumbered whites descendants of these christianized africans were among the first settlers of the new world as slaves servants and scouts they accompanied spanish french and portuguese explorers in the pioneer penetrations of north and south africa thirty negroes were with balboa when he discovered the pacific ocean three hundred went with cortez into mexico and some of them planted and harvested the first wheat crop in the new world the shape of this period is summed up in an old saying the first white man to meet an indian in america was a negro this was true in many areas of north and south america a bold negro explorer estevanico opened up the southwest for the spaniards negroes helped to found st augustine in and made up a large portion of its population during the colonial period negroes were in florida alabama new mexico and california as early as and respectively perhaps the first permanent settlers in america were the africans who accompanied lucas vasquez de ayllon the spanish explorer in de ayllon settled in the area of presentday south carolina with five hundred white men one hundred africans and eightynine horses a few months later the africans revolted slew several whites and fled to the indians in the fervor of worldwide exploration and the commingling of peoples from different lands and cultures new vistas opened up for both africans and europeans it seemed for a spell that christianity would have the same fertilizing influence in africa in the sixteenth century as islam had had in the eleventh and twelfth centuries but it was not to be while the bright young black men were feasting in the courts of lisbon while the eager black priests were genuflecting in the courts of the vatican the dream was dissolving in granules of greed ships were already plying the seas men were already experimenting with sugar caneit was not to be the opening of the new world and the introduction of sugar planting in the west indies created a demand for men that casual kidnapping could not supply mens visions shifted now from the poor whites of europe to the poor blacks of africa and the africaneuropean dialogue became a monologue focused almost exclusively on a trade in men in vain did some of the more farsighted african monarchs plead for an extension of the old trade in goods and ideas in manicongo the ruler of the congo states made a desperate attempt to end the slave trade in a strong letter to john iii of portugal manicongo said we need it from your kingdoms no other than priests and people to teach in schools and no other goods but wine and flour for the holy sacrament that is why we beg of your highness to help and assist us in this matter commanding the factors that they should send here neither merchants nor wares because it is our will that in these kingdoms of the congo there should not be any trade in slaves or markets for slaves we would be living in a different world today if manicongos plea for point iv aid and peace corps personnel had been heeded in the sixteenth century but europe was impervious to such pleas she was only interested in the gold of black bodies and she forced that obsession on africato the undoing of both europe and africa as a result of the slave trade white europe became a single group opposed to the rest of the world and a new and terrifying idea was invented the idea of subordination and superordination based on skin color slavery contrary to the general impression did not spring from racism racism sprang from slavery the concept of race was a direct outgrowth of the slave trade and it was deliberately invented by an exploiting group which needed a theology to maintain and defend privileges founded on naked force the first act of the slave trade the exchange of men and goods and ideas unfolded against the permissive backdrop of the medieval world which sanctioned negro and white slavery but the slave trade soon took a more ominous turn within a few years fifty thousand or more black men and women were crossing the atlantic each year and the soil of africa and america was drenched with their blood in the wake of this development a need arose for justification of that which could not be justified by any theory in western thought by this time of course the slave trade was the bulwark of the whole european economy a fact which made the search for a theology more desperate blessed are men who can steal without the need of theology for when the need for justification arises the thief and his cause are more than halflost as long as manstealing and manselling occasioned no public outcry the slave trader could fight down his doubts but when voices cried out in rebuke and remonstrance men cast about for a reassuring straw it was evil of course to ravage continents and exterminate hundreds of thousands of black and red men but what if what if negroes and indians were not men in the same sense that europeans were on this questionwhat ifwas raised a terrifying theology of guilt and fear europe emerged now as the great white subject in counterpoise to the nonwhite other the europe of plato and socrates was invaded by a new spirit a spirit born of the renaissance and the commercial revolution there was something amoral about this spirit something demonic faustian and recklessly individualistic stimulated by the invention of paper gunpowder and printing the three often went together and the opening of a whole new world beyond europe threw itself with a bloody spasm across the face of the earth ravaging plundering tearing down and yes building up this thunderous outer event when fed into the stream of internal colonial politics produced explosive changes negroes and whites in the american colonies began to experience each other in different ways they began to withdraw into themselves and to prepare in their different lights for the confrontation to come i rx si in the crucial period between and the furies began to gather in america for a portentous decision some negroes in this period were servants and some were free but an increasingly large number of colonists were falling into the habit of regarding incoming africans as servants for life this development a reflection of eddies and currents in the outer world was menacing but not conclusive the negros status until the latter part of the seventeenth century was so amorphous that ultimately it could have been defined in any one of a number of ways slavery or modified slavery was a distinct possibility for all disadvantaged peopleindians as well as black and white immigrants so was an open society socioeconomic forcesa worldwide demand for tobacco and the development of capitalist planting techniques based on the use of gang labortilted the structure in the direction of negro slavery in the fateful sixties of the seventeenth century men of power in the colonies egged on by men of power in london made a catastrophic decision that would lead step by step to the fateful sixties of the nineteenth century and the fateful sixties of the twentieth it was decided in the s to ground the american economic system on human slavery organized around the random distribution of melanin in mens skins beginning around the planter class drafted and passed laws that made negroes servants for life intermarriage was interdicted and children born of negro women were ruled bond or free according to the status of the mother this was the fatal and perhaps irreparable break in the sense of community between negro and white americans it was the starting point the first turn on the road to the summer of and the dangers beyond having made one step the white power structure had to take another more ominous step nature does not prepare men for the roles of master and slave it requires rigid training long persisted in to make a slave or a slaveholder men must be carefully taught and the lessons taught one generation must be learned anew by the next the negro and white working class of the s the bulk of the population had not been prepared for the roles outlined in the new script of statutes it was necessary therefore to teach negroes and whites that they should not and could not deal with each other on the basis of reciprocity of emotion and relation and this remarkably enough proved exceedingly difficult the forced breaking of the bond can be traced with precision in the emotionallytoned areas of love and sextwo constitutive factors in communitas which is by definition a state of organic wholeness between equals residing in a common territory equals who extend to each other complete reciprocity or the possibility of complete reciprocity in positive affects love sexual union marriage friendship social communion and communal conventions property law trade the complete severing of the fragile bonds of community in the areas of positive affects became the dominant note in planter strategy fearing a deterioration of slavery if the boundaries between white and black people were dissolved in the caldron of sexual intimacy the planter class mobilized every unit of power for an assault on intermingling legislatures began to grind out laws of every imaginable description virginia legislated against intermingling in there were similar legislative paroxysms in other states maryland passed antiamalgamation laws in the sentiment of the aristocratic lawmakers leaped out from the dry statutes in words like spurious issue disgrace of the nation defiline private vigilante associations and racial purists whipped the doubtful into line behind the purists and the good grey lawmakers stood god himself in the person of parsons who blessed the rupture in community with words from the holy bible but astoundingly nothing worked against the law as revealed by the parson and the legislator intermarriage and intermingling continued in america for more than one hundred years men would say later that there was a natural antipathy between negroes and whites that no law could mitigate but the record belies them negroes and whites were taught hate and fear they were driven apart by symbols sermons and signed papers every instrument of persuasionlaw religion prison banishmentwas used to destroy the developing bonds of community between negro and white americans who was responsible for this policy the planters the aristocrats the parsons the lawyers the founding fathersthe good people they sowed the seeds of the bitter harvest james hugo johnston who made a detailed study of this problem placed the responsiblity squarely on the shoulders of the governing class johnston wrote the system of life built up in the agricultural colonies resulted in planter control both social and governmental institutions were devices wrought by the planters the system of slavery may have been thrust upon them by england but the problems arising from it were first of all the planters problems and on the governing class is the responsibility for the system worked out in the colonies planters were motivated primarily by economic considerations but johnston added it is also to be believed that the planters wished to develop an attitude of race superiority through a fear that at some future time the poor white might lead the mulatto and the negro in revolt against the established order my emphasis how was this policy justified at first the rationalization was religion negroes were condemned not because they were negroes but because they were nonchristians the limitations of this policy were glaringly apparent it was not permanent men could become christians as an increasingly large number of negroes became christians planters cast about for a more enduring disability something that could not be changed but before this step could be made it was necessary to clear up certain theological difficulties a celebrated divine wrote a long book of two hundred or more pages to prove that it was not a sin to baptize slaves with great seriousness puritans and planters debated this issue and decided that christianity and slavery were not incompatible it was decided moreover that it was a duty a christian duty to bring barbarians into the folds of christian civilization so their souls could be cleansed for the heavens beyond thus in the end god and profits were reconciled virginia in clothed the ideological sleightofhand in legal language the conferring of baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom after that it was easy the negro population which had grown slowly during the twilight interim of freedom lunged forward by the number had increased to fifty thousand when the declaration of independence was signed there were five hundred thousand negroes in america not all negroes were reduced to slavery remnants of a free negro class survived and grew by natural additions manumissions and escapes the status of free negroes during the early part of the eighteenth century was relatively high but as slavery fastened itself on the minds of men free negroes were pushed down to a status that was almost indistinguishable from bondage what happened now dwarfed everything that had happened before the jamestown experience the early african experience antonio isabella manicongo all were forgotten there emerged an image of the negro as a person who was powerless not because he lacked power but because of some inherent defect in his character a defect related in some mysterious way to the packets of melanin in his skin the negro became in lewis c copelands phrase a contrast conception he was black to the white mans white he was the devil to the white mans god he was dark to the white mans light it was not necessary within this conceptual framework for men to do anything one was born white and in this aspect one inherited the earth propelled by this psychic dynamism the white ego expanded puffed up exploded and rolled across the face of the earth absorbing the consciousness and the souls of men born black red and brown the effect of all this whatever the intention and the intention was not far removed from the effect was to deprive the negro of legal force and standing in the community of men it was to make him a person outside the protection of law an exile a stranger and an outcast this as thomas jefferson pointed out in a rejected draft of the declaration of independence was war against human nature or at least against that part of human nature enshrined in black skins for more than four hundred years this war continued before it was over one hundred million black people had perished and twenty million more had been scattered over the western hemisphere when the war started there was no mask between black men and white menthere was no screen between insult and retaliation stimulus and response blow and retort black men and white men therefore stood toe to toe hacking burning and slashing murder piled on murder and a red ribbon of violence enclosed black people and white people in a circle of fate direct violent resistance this was the black mans first response to white power resistance began with sitdowns and hunger strikes on slave ships although every precaution was taken although the males were shackled together and guards walked the decks with drawn cutlasses day and night there were repeated uprisings on the slave ships at least fiftyfive documented mutinies between and not to mention fragmentary references to two hundred more the struggle continued on land there was a slave revolt in hispaniola as early as the governor immediately asked for a temporary suspension of the slave trade because the negroes encouraged the indians to rebellion twentyfour years later the struggle moved to the american mainland with the revolt of the one hundred africans who accompanied lucas de ayllon direct violent resistance continued and reached a peak in the nineteenth century herbert aptheker the authority on american negro slave revolts has documented at least insurrections and conspiracies in continental america although some of his sources have been questioned there can be little doubt that revenge and revolt were dominant motifs in the reactionpatterns of the first africanamericans the negroes who came to america in the eighteenth century were strikingly different from those conditioned by one hundred years of bondage the first africanamericans saw themselves through the prism of the old gods they did not feel inferior to the white men and what is more to the point white men were not so sure that they were superior to them there were accordingly repeated revolts in slaves in new york city revolted and killed at least nine whites and a virginia plot of prompted the lieutenant governor to order white men to take their pistols to church with them the first negro leader to emerge with any clarity from the anonymity of the masses cato of stono was an advocate of direct violent resistance in cato led a slave revolt near stono south carolina the black rebels under catos leadership killed several whites fired a number of buildings and set out for florida which was held then by spain they called out liberty a contemporary account marched on with colours displayed and two drums beating some twentyfive whites were killed before cato and his group were subdued before anything else could be done before the fields could be tilled before monticello and mount vernon could be built the first generation of africanamericans men made in the image of cato had to be mastered the breaking of the slave the destruction of the african as an individualthis was the first task before the pioneer white americans in order for slavery to succeed it was necessary to annihilate the thinking processes of slaves naked power was not enough the white mans power had to be internalized the slave in other words had to be robbed of his selfconception and selfrespect he had to become someone else or pretend he was someone else much has been said and rightly about the physical violence of slavery equally harsh and far crueller was the mental violence the wrenching of minds out of cerebral sockets and the crushing of bones of belief and habit in order to control people as we learned from europeans in german concentration camps and americans in chinese concentration camps it is necessary to subject them to constant fatigue constant insecurity and overwhelming power in a closed system long before hitler long before mao tsetung southern planters had mastered these elementary techniques anticipating the devious tactics of the modem police state masters laid hands on the minds of their chattel by the old method of the carrot and the stick by terror and by smiles by whips chains words symbols prayers and curses the negro was taught to stand in fear of white power in some such manner africans were given a new conception of themselves a conception that carried as coreelements guilt anxeity and inferiority the laying of hands on the mind of a whole people the pulling out by the roots of old customs and habits continued for hundred of years hundreds of thousands died in the process and hundreds of thousands went insane but millions survived maimed to be sure shrunken shriven diminue but withal alive and breathing with enough fragmentary memories of the past to give them a mooring in the present and hope for the future the terms of that survival were harsh and selfenforcing in order to survive the slave had to give up or pretend to give up that which makes man humanhope ambition responsibility and will no slave could stand up to life as a human being to live for a slave especially a male slave was to renounce to renounce anger and love and indignation to renounce hate and human hurt to renounce the claims and the rewards of love the responsibilities of parenthood and the pride of ownershipto renounce these things voluntarily in the service of a higher ideal but at the command of another human will arbitrarily imposed by society millions learned to wear masks of renunciation in the inferno of slavery but few adjusted to their situation james redpath and others who called slavery a state of perpetual war between master and slave cut to the bone of the problem that which was human in the slave was always at war with that in the master which breached the bounds of the human far from being a humane institution american slavery was diabolically cured in that it robbed the negro of that sense of human dignity which underlies all social intercourse slavery destroyed the negros family emptied his mind and impoverished his soul more than that it made him doubt himself nor did the master escape unlimited power over menand especially womenis debasingone pays a price for it in the attempted absorption and destruction of negro consciousness the white man remoulded himself and involved himself catastrophically with an image that was both loved and hated white man entered into negro as w j cash said but negro also entered into white man subtly influencing every thought every gesture every desire and the two groups thus impaled thrashed about repicrocally making and destroying each other in an embrace until death or salvation between the master and the slave between the white man who approached the negro in the aspect of a master and the negro who responded in the aspect of a slave there was absolute silence it was impossible for the two to communicate because the ground of communicationequality responsibility and mutual trusthad been destroyed beyond that was the obvious fascination of black skin for white men and women the master opened his eyes on a soft black mother surrogate who ever afterwards held him in the lap of a monstrous and forbidden dream the black mammy who extended the breast he sucked as a child the black mammy who mashed with her own hands the food he ate who sang to him strange lullabies and led him smiling into sleep this image colored his dreaming and his desiring and later of course it was this womans daughter or in many cases what turned out to be the same thing his father s daughter who initiated him into the mysteries of love incest plied on incest behind the cotton curtain of slavery and the whole faulknerian drama turned in on itself in an orgy of oblique fears men asked themselves other men asked them what have you become what in the name of god have you made yourself and of course there could be no answer short of the grave for master or slave white man and negro were estranged perhaps beyond reconciliation but so were the negro and the white state slavery was aggression against the negro personality by individual masters but it was also aggression by the state which gave to a surrogate power to hold restrain work whip convey and sell human beings with the backing or at least the silence of every structure of power in america negroes were stripped of those rights of personality that are usually considered sacred between men vice immortality and brutality were institutionalized and given names the sanctity of the family was violated children were sold from mothers and fatherhood was abolished it is not generally recognized that american slavery was significantly different and vastly more oppressive than slavery in other areas in south america and the caribbean there was a margin of personality that the master could not violate in america the slave belong to the master absolutely it was true literally true that the slave had no rights that white men were bound to respect the old south was a totalitarian system dominated by one party the party of planters the party line was cotton and human slavery no deviation from this point of view was permitted either in the church school or legislature nor was silence enough men were required to say often and loud that slavery was good and that freedom was bad things reached such a pass that the declaration of independence was repudiated and thomas jefferson was denounced as an unstable reformer infected by unamerican ideas in the end southern newspapers and southern intellectuals demanded that the north endorse a crusade for the permanent enslavement of free negroes and poor white immigrants in the south planter strategy was based on the old maxim divide et impera divide and rule planters learned early to hide behind the images of the overseers who were usually poor whites and the drivers who were members of the oppressed class thus there grew up the myth of the good white folk who were supposed to be above the crudities of the poor white class on large plantations most slaves never came into contact with the real power only a crisis would reveal the true nature of the system most slaves therefore did not focus their resentment against their real enemy the planter but against the poor whites who furnished most of the overseers and who were the poor whites they were white people who happened to be poor they lived on the poor land planters did not want like slaves they hated not planters who were the real authors of their ills but negroes whom they saw as threats to their social economic and psychological wellbeing all this was pure windfall to the planter class which consciously and unconsciously fanned the flames of hate between poor whites and negroes fanned the flames and thereby controlled both classes utterly not only poor whites but astoundingly free negroes in the south accepted the planters definition of the situation this is not to say that there were no brilliant and dedicated free negroes but the great majority of free negroes in the south accepted the planterinspired myth that the basic division in america was not between negroes and whites but between free people negroes and whites and slaves having accepted this definition free negroes in the south were leisurely pushed down to a position that was not radically different from slavery having divided free negroes and slaves and whites and negroes planters turned now to a destruction of the community of victims in a desperate attempt to prevent the growth of solidarity and racial pride the only qualities on which a mass movement could base itself planters exerted constant pressure from without and fostered internal divisions within throughout the slave period as abraham lincoln pointed out there were packets of explosive material on every plantation what was lacking was the indispensable connecting train agitators organizers leaders to prevent the necessary connection between agitation and explosive packets planters concentrated on three key elementsfreedom of assembly freedom of movement and privacy of the home where arms could be hidden the slave codes the crystallization of planter strategy forbade slaves to assemble in groups of more than five or seven away from their home plantation slaves were forbidden to leave plantations without passes and they could not blow horns beat drums or read books slave patrols or paderollers as the slaves called them were authorized to make periodic searches of slave cabins the whole complex apparatus of control was designed to isolate the slave and to cut him away from social moorings but external control was not enough slavery could not succeed without the complicity of the enslaved to oppress negroes more effectively masters made use of selected slaves as agents spies and bellwethers this ancient technique was facilitated because of the differing relations of slaves to the center of power the basic division a division with implications and ramifications that color contemporary negro life was between house slaves and field slaves in the context of current realities it is definitely a hostile act to call a man a house negro or a descendant of house slaves the house slave syndrome a certain servility before white power and a fawning imitation of white models is used repeatedly today as a weapon of attack in the struggles for power within the negro community who were house slaves how did they come by their low repute house slaves were defined spatially and psychologically by their physical and mental proximity to the master class and their relative isolation from the great mass of negroes who were field slaves house slaves worked in and around the house maids butlers gardeners or performed special services as artisans and technicians as a group house slaves were exceptionally useful to masters who told them they were different who urged them and in some cases commanded them to keep their distance from the masses at the apex of the slave elite was the driver who maintained order in the quarters and bossed the slaves in the fields the driver was the archetype of the negro leader and his image would exert an enormous influence on the expectations and attitudes of both negroes and whites after slavery like practically all negro leaders until modern times the driver was an agentof the master class it was his duty to restrain negroes to pacify them and to see that they worked hard his relationship to negroes was anomalous to say the least having no power of his own existing at the sufferance of the planter and receiving minor perquisites so long as he supported the planters interest the driver operated in a twilight world between the oppressed and the oppressor that some negroes cooperated with masters and helped to make the slave system work should occasion no surprise it has been so among all people at all times the iron law of power is that most men of whatever color of whatever tongue will accommodate themselves to their situation and that a small minority on the left will protest while another minority on the right will seek to capitalize on the situation by ingratiating themselves with the powers that be it was so with the negro in slavery it was so with americans in chinese concentration camps it will be so as long as power is power and men are men what surprises above all in the slave experience is the amount of slave cohesiveness despite strong centrifugal forces there was a bond of sympathy between slave groups one discerns in the literature a systematic attempt to overemphasize the degree of intragroup conflict one student said there was little cohesion among slaves because there was not enough counterpressure to prevent collaboration this is an oversimplification of a complex problem there is never enough counterpressure to prevent collaboration in a totalitarian system france and other countries had a fair amount of social cohesion in world war ii but there was a bumper crop of collaborators in the slave quarters as in france collaboration evoked the ire of the community of victims in tennessee for example a slave named jim killed a slave named isaac for helping to catch him after his escape at the trial the judge observed that isaac seems to have lost caste he had combined with the white folks no slight offense in their eyes that one of their own color subject to a like servitude should abandon the interests of his caste and betray black folks to the white people rendered him an object of general aversion subject to a like servitude sharing the same interests excluded from the general community and proscribed by law slaves of all ranks developed their own society which differed in many ways from the society of masters the locus of this community was the slave quarters the embryo of the harlems of today all slaveshouse and fieldwere members of the community of victims there were as we have noted chasms between slave groups but there were also bridges the basic fact in plantation life was race and slaves no matter how high they rose or how light their skin were blackand they knew it the basic psychological fact is that the slave elite needed the field slaves if only to have someone to look down on in the quarters slaves of all ranks could drop their masks in the circle of suffering they could stretch out their legs and their souls paradoxically the slaves who lived in closest proximity to white influence were the slaves most maimed those furthest removed from white influence on the other hand were the freest in the harlems of the plantations field hands had a small but nonetheless important area of freedom for a small part of the day they were not under the thumbs and feet of white people thus a man or woman could build a fragile windbreak against white power it is not at all surprising that the deep and brooding spirituals and the embryonic blues came not from the house but from the field between the society of masters and the society of victims there was little interaction conflict did not grow out of their situation it was inherent in that situation the attempt to deny negroes even a minimum of social life involved negro slaves and masters in a web of espionage a web of waiting and watching of measuring and spying and maneuvering in this web it was every slave against every white man and every triumph over the master no matter how petty was recognized as a triumph for the cause jeanpaul sartres description of resistance in occupied france illuminates the nature of the struggle between master and slave in the old south everywhere he wrote on billboards in the newspapers on the screen we encountered the revolting and insipid picture of ourselves that our oppressors wanted us to accept because the nazi venom seeped even into our thoughts every accurate thought was a conquest because an allpowerful police tried to force us to hold our tongues every word took on the value of a declaration of principles because we were hunted down every one of our gestures had the weight of a solemn commitment there were no billboards in slavery but there were tyrantsand there were men who stood up to tyrants every slave protest direct or subtle was a step in the development of new forms of life organization every slave protest was a choice made in the face of death for life a slave underground crystallized around the stealing of goods the trading of information on the intentions and state of mind of the enemy and the hiding and passing on of fugitive slaves all slaves did not participate in the underground somea definite minorityhad been so crushed by slavery that they were timid and afraid othersmainly house servantshad been so conditioned by the castoff clothes and castoff ideas of their masters that they kissed their chains still others a definite majoritymaintained a sense of expectancy and hope that is one of the most memorable tributes to the indomitable tenacity of the human spirit the dominant response of the vast majority of slaves were discontent unrest and protest there were repeated insurrections and there is solid evidence that the south lived in constant fear of the docile slaves the most dramatic form of resistance was terrorism arson murder sabotage carried out for the most part by the socalled bad negro a germinal figure in negro folklore slaves also used a variety of techniques in undramatic daytoday resistance to slavery on occasions they staged sitdowns and slowdowns in the cotton fields on impulse sometimes and sometimes on plan they sat down and refused to move until work loads were lightened some groups fled to the forests at the height of the cottonpicking season and sent emissaries to negotiate with old master quieter still and equally effective was the daytoday sabotage the gate left open for cattle to escape the expensive tool or implement accidentally dropped or broken at one time or another almost all slaves dropped their masksa little the dissatisfied look the slow unwilling movement the labored stroke of the hoe the drawling tone the slow hearing the feigned stupidity the sham pains and sickness the short memory and always the mocking smile and the accusing laugh these were the tactics of the undramatic slave despite or perhaps because of all attempts to crush it the rebellious will of the slave endured there was something tragic about this stubborn will but there was also something heroic about it by escaping or helping others to escape by reading and teaching others to read by stealing and helping others to steal by homicide suicide and infanticide the slave opposed his will to his masters the unpleasant fact is that slaves did not feel that they had unqualified moral obligations to white peopleand white people knew it it was considered right and proper to steal from white people and to lie to them in an odd reversal of the taney dictum slaves acted as though white people had no rights they were bound to respectif they were clever enough and quick enough frederick douglass the great exslave put his pen on the heart of the matterthe break in community he was he said a slave of society which has in fact in form and substance bound itself to assist the white man in robbing me of my rightful liberty and the just rewards of my labor as a result douglass said whatever rights i have against the master i have equally against those confederated with him in robbing me of my liberty since society has marked me out as privileged plunder on the principle of selfpreservation i am justified in plundering in turn this attitude of defiance and protest flows out of the bottomless well of the negro folk tradition few slaves wrote books but almost all of them sang songs and told stories it is to these stories and songs we must go for the slaves comment on his condition the spirituals the bestknown of negro folk products speak of exile and homelessness of wandering in some lonesome valley or down some unknown road a long way from home without father or mother or sister or brother the spirituals speak of sorrow and despair but there is something else a cosmic discontent a discontent so deep and pervasive that only the blind or hard of hearing can miss it in these songs the slave commented on a world composed of masters and slavescommented and analyzed and judged he also used song as a means of communication the whoops hollers and field calls contained secret messages about meeting places intentions and dangers as a matter of fact double meanings permeate the whole fabric of negro sacred and secular music consider for example the symbols of release de walls come tumblin down of battle joshua fit de battle of jericho the judgment pharoahs army got drowned consider also the obvious fact that the slaves identified with the hebrew children and projected their hostility and hate onto pharoah the slave symbol for the white master the biblical symbols did not appeal to all slaves scholarly interest in the spirituals has obscured the fact that the great majority of slaves were non if not antichristian the secular songs of this group were irreverent and impudent some which later metamorphosed into the blues were existentially absurd the negro slave also protested obliquely in story and folklore a deep and bitter strain of hostility runs through the cycle of animal stories particularly the brer rabbit series which a southern newspaperman collected from exslaves and put into the mouth of a stereotype uncle remus uncle remus was joel chandler harris creation but the hostility and the malevolent rabbit in bernard wolfes phrase came from the negros heart the central theme of the stories is the defeat of a powerful and wicked animal the white man by a weak and clever animal the negro in the animal cycle the weak prevails over the strong and evil meets an avenger for the slave the stories of rabbits outwitting and eventually leading foxes to death were a psychological release and a creative selfprojection this image of revolt and revenge became flesh in the leaders of the three great slave revolts and conspiracies gabriel prosser richmond virginia denmark vesey charleston south carolina nat turner southampton county virginia though separated by time and space prosser vesey and turner were of a piece prosser and turner were field slaves turner was a preacher and prosser was a biblical student who found food for insurrection in the blood and doom passages of the old testment vesey on the other hand was a free man a welltodo carpenter he was by his own admission satisfied with his condition yet he risked his life and paid the supreme price in a bold effort to free his brothers vesey was relatively old about fiftyfour turner and prosser were young thirtyone and twentyfour respectively the three men were obsessed by one dominant idea the destruction of all white people in their view the enemy was society the only solution they believed was a war of immediate and total extermination nat turner was moved by a mystical obsession that god had called him to rise up and slay my enemies with their own weapons like joan of arc he had provocative visions of the impending doom of his adversaries gabriel and vesey on the other hand were motivated by the revolutionary concepts of the american haitian and french revolutions gabriel and his men in fact had purchased a white silk flag on which were inscribed the words liberte on mort of the three men nat turner came closest to succeeding for fortyeight hours he held southampton county in a black embrace of death with a long bloody sprawl he threw himself on his masters and slew sixty men women and children before he was defeated nat was hanged finally but his spirit lived on his career it has been said made an impact upon the south as great as the careers of john c calhoun or thomas jefferson after nat it was no longer possible for men to pretend there were men in the slave quarters one could not always depend on their masks at any moment the mask could turn into a horrid face of blood and vengeance gabriel prosser and denmark vesey did not succeed they were thwarted at the last moment by the treachery of house slaves but the record shows that they were leaders of largescale liberation movements both men laid their plans with great care storing weapons and disguises and creating huge organizations under the eyes and noses of the masters gabriel worked underground for four or five months holding meetings at fish fries and barbecues stealing into richmond once a week to study the terrain he had enlisted according to contemporary estimates from two thousand to fifty thousand slaves vesey who was by far the most astute of the slave rebels demonstrated a talent bordering on genius he worked undercover in charleston and environs for more than five years signing up whole plantations perfecting a celllike organization that was never cracked it has been estimated that more than nine thousand slaves were involved in his attempt to destroy slavery the three great slave revolts were in essence attempts to recreate community in rebellion turner prosser and vesey illuminated the chasm between man and man and man and state throwing their bodies across the great divide these three created a boundary situation a limiting moment of lucidity in which the master confronted traumatically the boundaries of freedom between man and man the implications of all this were clear enough and bad enough fearing a total conflagration men grew anxious and a language or rather a nonlanguage was invented to hold the terror that lived in mens hearts as the civil war approached slavery became to appropriate melvilles arresting metaphor a great white whale which threatened to devour both negroes and whites the long arm of slavery reached out and compromised the constitution which contained three proslavery clauses it blunted the force of jefferson and washington and twisted lincolns words in his mouth the slave experience is basic to an understanding of current racial realities it is the substructure of both segregation de facto and de jure and movements against segregation as a result of slavery whites were overwhelmed by a guilt so monstrous and pervading that it poisoned thought at its very roots another legacy of this period is a deep fear of the negro not a physical fear but something deeper and more menacing a fear of losing grip on life a fear of losing control and to this must be added the immense counterweight of negro embitterment the habit of regarding the state as an expression of the white personality the perfervid fascination with negro sex life the polarization of the north and south the noblesse oblige approach to negroes as suppliants seeking handouts rather than citizens with inalienable rights no man can bestow or withhold and above all the rupture in community between black man and white man and black man and the state all these are legacies of the slave substructure slavery in sum was a seed experience the significant dimensions of the race problem the special dynamism that gave the summers of and their special harshness are reflections of eddies that lie deep in the mind and deep in the past the negro is what he is today because he was once held in slavery by white people and white people are what they are today because they cannot forget because negroes will not let them forget what they did yesterday the most dramatic link with this substructure of remembered wrong is the image of the young student sittingin at a lunch counter reading hegel or aristotle and singing the same song that sustained his greatgrandmother in the slave cabins oh freedom oh freedom oh lord freedom over me and before vd be a slave id be buried in my grave an go home to my lord and be free the song and the students use of it tell us how much things have changed and how much they have remained the same even more significant is the fact that the song invokes something that transcends time and slaves and masters something that was honored in rome and athens and will be honored as long as man breathessomething in man that does not love walls and chains who needs negro digest with so many other magazines on the marketfrom the big slick picture magazines to the thin intellectual journalssuch a magazine as negro digest might appear almost irrelevant but who nowadays calls the negros aspirations writings thoughts and actions irrelevant this is what negro digest is all about negro digest is the only such magazine that frankly reveals what the people of color are doing saying and thinking as reflected in its articles essays general features short stories forums informational notes poetry and priceless humor negro digest provides an outlet for wellknownas well as the new and young articulate writers and thinkers and provides a source for those seeking negro historical facts guidance and information important to ones wellbeing perhaps this is why negro digest has been called the most stimulating magazine on the market by teachers housewives professionals and others who are aware in the true sense of the word who needs negro digest i not every person but then not every person dares to think honestly and creatively about shaping his own destiny improving the life of others or changing even a small corner of the world in which he lives such thoughts are too uncomfortable they have been known to start revolutions
the dying beast of racism by louis e lomax racistsunless the victim is a major negro spokesman merit one paragraph on page of a nonsouthern daily a few pockets of resistance are left but the back of visible segregation has been broken and the reverend dr martin_luther_king jr has walked off with the top international peace accolade for having led the negrononviolently at thatto the waters edge of the american mainstream now that the season of pomp and circumstance has passed there is left the imperative and awesome if unspectacular miracle of reclaiming million negroes from the bonedeep effects of years of first slavery and then segregation just as awesome and unspectacular is the equally mandatory miracle of reclaiming the american white manhis heart soul and mindfrom the deep effects of having been first the slave owner and then the privileged majority in this historical tragedy if this republic uses its brain instead of its brawn its sense of history rather than its raw emotions then this will be the season of reclamation not recrimination true the race problem is far from solved just recently negroes and whites peered at each other over gun barrels in bogalusa la cores national director james farmer was leading his battalions including women and children to the firing lines martin_luther_king jr drew a bead on both los angeles and chicagochicago because of defacto school segregation and los angeles because that towns politicians had committed a monumental boondoggle that lost the community million in poverty fundsas his nonsouthern summer projects naacpers fanned out from their convention in denver to a half dozen southern states to conduct voter registration drives and the congress of the united states lurched inexorably forward to passage of the most sweeping voter rights bill in human history these isolated events many of them tinged with tragedy are but passing entries in the diary of the negro revolt they are skirmishes which future historians will study as final evidence of the racial madness that had it been left unchecked for another quarter of a century was about to destroy this nation but time call it god if that makes you more comfortable was on our side collectively we mortally wounded the monster as he grew from slumbering childhood into wildly destructive adolescence the violence in the streets then from bogalusa to harlem from los angeles to jackson miss is the last wild death romp and scream of the stricken beast of racism there will be blood and more blood pain and more pain nothing approaching normalcy is due this nation for yet another decade but the beast will die and when he does the same forces that combined to deliver the lethal blow must recommit and reassign themselves to the task of reclaiming the union from the effects of the beasts presence in this land since its inception the reclamation of the negro has already begun no less than a dozen government agencies are now totally involved with seeing to it that any negro with the guts and brains becomes and does whatever his talents say he can become and do i know of at least a half dozen private agencies that are totally committed to the same project todays negro does not lack for opportunity alas the precise opposite is the fact everywhere one goes one encounters white bankers industrialists and ordinary businessmen looking for instant negroes who can qualify for jobs as vice presidents electronics engineers and grayflannel junior executives negroesof all shapes sizes colors demeanors and varying mental abilitiesweve got of supernegroes however we have none that is to say the american negro on the whole is an underdeveloped people if the middleclass white home and business communities are to be used as norms then the negro community is a total disaster area you cant get bankers from a community of people who never saw a banker with whom they could identify you cant get electronic engineers out of broken homes in which whatever parent symbol is left neither reads nor writes and when the negro children gather among the broken glass in the alleys of rochester n y to discuss what they are going to be when they grow up it is very unlikely that one of them would name a profession he never hears of and which societyin its total impact upon him and at the age of has told him he cannot achieve because of his color even if he has heard of it and wishes to achieve it one of the major tasks then in the reclamation of the negro is to inform and motivate those youngsters who are still in grade school upon whom the evil days have not yet fully come nigh ordinary classroom teaching will not do it if he is in fifth grade the chances are he is already reading two levels below his white classmates and is beginning to dream of the day when he will grow a little bigger and can drop out nor can ordinary classroom teachers negro or white do the job they are too involved with curriculum standards flow charts and bellshaped curves that children from harlem and chicagos south side skew just by walking in the classroom no regular classrooms and career teachers cannot accomplish the needed miracle rather the negro communityevery church every empty store front that can be refurbished and every day school after the regular classes are donemust be converted into a beehive of basic education these youngsters need to be taught more than to read write and speak well they need blunt thorough courses in precisely who they are and why and they should be forced to realize just what opportunities await them if they will apply themselves that is the place the time and the methodthe only place time and method i submitto breed the negroes who in the process of realizing their individual potentials will reclaim the negro for america the schools i like to call them studyins should be manned by the devoted kind of educated civil_rights workers who deserted the halls of yale harvard bryn mawr and swarthmore to march on selma and to enter the peace corps there is a more pertinent role in the negro revolt for these dedicated youngsters than having their heads beaten and bloodied in the dying south their finest hours will be in the ghettoes ot the northand the south for that matternot on picket lines and in demonstrations but in special classrooms where negro youngsters are being readied to avail themselves of the opportunities that have been won at such great price not all negro youth will respond more accurately most of them will not but as quiet as it is kept most white kids dont respond to the professional challenge either most white people are simple ordinary folks and that is what most negroes will turn out to be this then is the second major move toward the reclamation of the negro the american negro has never enjoyed the right to be ordinary if a negro steals it is a commentary upon his race if a white man steals he is just a bad fellow by the same token and as a result of the same racist logic the negro has never been able to get the ordinary jobs that keep the majority of the nations white citizens cloaked in security and dignity the wealthy and the professionals are not the economic backbone of the republic it is the ordinary workerthe clerk the welder the fireman the policeman the bartender the realestate salesman the plumber the automobile mechanicwho form that american phenomenon in the lower middle class and keep the national economy moving the lower middle class are ordinary people in ordinary jobs and the negro encounters more difficulty crashing that circle than he does the enclaves of the professionals and the rich this is why the median annual income of the average negro family is some less than that of the white family and the gap is getting wider my own view is that entrance of the negro into the american lower middle class is the key issue the strategist for the negro revolution must deal with sitins have created negro opportunity but nothing short of studyins can make these opportunities become breadandbutter realities i realize i have spoken of the reclamation almost solely in economic terms but that is the american jargon that is the way of life in the country to which the negro is committed both by history and temperament i am the first to admit that change stirs in the american way of life perhaps as the new left suggests a new kind of economic thinking is in the making but the task before the negro revolutionaries is to prepare the negro to participate in what is the better he may participate in what will be conscience of a black conservative by preston dewitt wiley sr wisest amo vf if race understand j the mere agitation of rather than us be honest questions of social equality is the ex extremest folly and that progress in the enjoyment of all privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle artificial forcing let no race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized american negroes must be free the nation agrees to that but the vigorous dr martin_luther_king jr and other negro leaders should stop merely urging their followers to protest march and demonstrate in the streets and start an enlightened campaign supporting not just social but economic viability among the black people an efficient organization and a determined application of negro intelligence towards his own deliverance and security are needed to make democracy workable in this country needed to make the negro influential in the american mainstream while the aim of civil_rights demonstrations was and is a necessary aim it is a fact of human nature that goals can be lost sight of and tactics glorified more than objective it seems reasonable to suggest that while a broad spectrum of public opinion one which embraces a majority of the congress and the white house supports specific legislation aimed against social injustice continued street demonstrations have an air of shoddy anachronism about them it is not easy to see why the importance of incentives and escalated productivity are so murky to overall negro leadership what i mean here is that the negro zeitgeist is blown up by its own bomb to base its policy primarily on protest equality cannot be legislated it must be gained by character and achievement a negro leadership which attempts to fulfill the constitution by keeping the negro from losing faith in freedom as the way of civilization is sagacious rather than combative however this leadership usually supplies no workable programs to help solve the negroes complaints the bible says somewhere that where there is no vision the people perish i am not preaching black nationalism when i point out that the economic status of the negro is not wholly contingent upon the will of the controlling white majority and that negroes are in danger of becoming a people of professional beggers but no one can complain forever let us deserve to be great if a measure of the money and energy that has been spent in trying to effect legislation to assure equality for the black people i love so much had been spent on economiceducational programs to help prepare them for civic responsibilities perhaps the situation we face in alabama new york and mississippi would be on the road to solution the latent talents of millions of young negro americans must be recognized encouraged and developed so as to provide them with a firm base in the nations economy and social order without such a base it is unrealistic to pretend that negroes can sustain the political and social rights which belong to them with the precision that made the march on wallaces state capital so successful let negro leaders now turn their attention to employment housing and education the three great areas where fundamental improvement is crucial to the negros progress to my way of thinking the health of our economy requires escalated negro productivity and a growing sense of negro responsibility one of the negros biggest handicaps has been his failure to understand and use economic and political leverage but the advantage of a positive policy by negro leadership is that it has the advantage of equipping negroes to compete the negro community should bear in mind that the greater society they aspire to will be dominated by economics again let us be honestabsolute equality is a goal that will probably never be attained that is an ideal not of this world however the administrations great society advocates are correct in the assumption that a social order can be created in which each section of the national community can justly feel that it is in no way exploited by the otherfor every great society must ultimately be genuinely constructive all of its members must have a stake in its existence the health of our economy also requires a growing number of negro businesses and a growing number of negro home owners hence the crisis in negro selfreliant enterprisewith only per cent of all american negroes selfemployed or in a managerial capacity compared with per cent for white workers the need for cohesion in the negro community is seen as essential to organized negro initiative and enterprise while i am not unmindful that historically the ambitious negro has been held down by a lack of education less access to the money market limited experience community segregation and invisible barriers thrown up by trade and fraternity organizations the fact remains paradoxically that there is a great deal more the negro could do to help himself the cry of uncle tom is positive proof of this two roads are open to negroes one for those who recoil from hard effort cavil at challenge who reject competition and would like to leave the shape of their future to programs subsidized by the federal government in their timidity and lack of vision such negroes declare the problems confronting them virtually insoluble to private effort brushing aside for the moment questions of free enterprise and expediency would such a program alone equip negroes to openly compete it is doubtful the other road is harder to tread at first it demands clear sight concern with means as well as ends and without going into technical details hereproduction planning perspective and cohesion in the negro community above all else we negroes are free to choose and we shall be responsible for our choice before history selfishnesssuccess self sacrificesuicide by dr leo louis martello ince time immemorial s man black and white f has been blackmailed into believing that self ishness is a vice that selfsacrifice is a virtue in the case of the negro in america deprived of his civil and more important human rights it would be more proper to call it white blackmail the little white lies consist of the following triumvirate faith force and fraud faith of the whitetaught negro converts meant his being blackmailed by the bible the christcross was used as a club to clobber his consciousness and selfrespect the ideal of all true believers a passive sissified christ nothing could be further from the truth christ was a man of courage of conviction who defied the conventions of his time he wasnt a martyr he was murdered quite a difference he defied his family his friends the high priests and the ruling romans turn the other cheek he was killed because he didnt the only time you should turn the other cheek is to get yourself into a better position to give your antagonist a good punch in the nose dont be bullied by a false interpretation of the bible the meek shall inherit the earth has bamboozled minority groups for centuries into submission the worst part of this is that it is an incorrect translation the language of christ was aramaic in which the words meek and wise are written the same the only way one can tell what meaning is meant is by the voice inflection or sentence structure scholars unfamiliar with this fact mistranslated the wise shall inherit the earth into the meek all tyrants extol the virtues of faith since they cant possibly back it up by any facts when faith didnt work they used force murder torture violence lynchings terror what is seldom said though is that the victim is more morally to blame than the victimizer he has accepted without challenge the dogma of selfsacrifice he has permitted his enemy to rob him of the only weapon he has for survival his mind his intellect has been anaesthetised into believing that any claim to his rights any positive selfassertion any display of a healthy ego is wrong he is in conflict with himself a man divided is easily conquered the negros greatest battle today is not in the realm of civil_rights it is within the realm of himself those who are most militant in their demand for equal rights no matter how just must make sure that this stems from a sense of justice and not from a desire for revenge every man black or white needs a sense of egoidentity if as a child he is made to believe that he is inferior he will grow up believing this he will either passively accept it and fail as a human being or aggressively and defensively fight his secret feelings about himself and become like those who made him that way what he needs to do most is challenge his own secret feelings not facts about himself no one is born with feelings of inferiority or superiority these are acquired during the formative years from unthinking adults not having the capacity to reason the child passively accepts other peoples estimates of himself he will live up to the image expected of him he will seek out those who are compatible with his own low selfesteem he forms unions of mutual contempt unable to respect himself he cant respect anyone else filled with selfloathing he perpetuates by word and deed the image of himself fostered on him by morally and intellectually bankrupt guardians or superiors this is the crime this is the tragedy even after and if he was granted all his civil_rights furnishing an outer target for attack giving him some selfrespect as a man he may be left with a vast emptiness why because he has failed to claim his right to himself he must recognize that all the evil committed against him as a negro or any other minority group is not a reflection on him as a man but on the unmanliness of the perpetrators as a child he didnt know any better didnt possess the intellectual equipment to block such impressions but as a man he does the terrible thing here is that so many try to claim their rights as men motivated by their feelings as children their passive acceptance their unconscious secret feelings of inferiority give moral sanction to their destroyers the public spectacle of fighting for their rights has less value collectively and individually than the private one of regaining the positive selfimage which is every mans birthright positive selfishness doesnt mean the popular conception of the parasite the plunderer the thinking only of himself at anothers expense it does mean independence dignity that no man has the right to ask you to sacrifice yourself for his interests or his to yours it means your right to refuse an unjustified request without guilt it means claiming your rights when you know that you are right and not letting yourself be imposed upon by the demands of others those who use deception in putting one over on the man are neither smart nor selfish they are selfless they are playing into the hands of their enemy living up to his image of them as unreliable youve got to watch them every minute if they had any sense of self they wouldnt furnish this kind of ammunition to a bigot true selfishness that is morally right means never sacrificing your selfrespect never compromising yourself for an immediate gain never doing anything either for a favor or as a favor but only because its in your best interest theres one thing that no man can give you no man can take away from you your selfrespect any time you accept less than what you know is your due any time you play along or permit someone to take unfair advantage any time you lay down your weapons you have no right to cry unfair its the same as the victim giving his executioner the gun that will kill him your greatest weapon is your mind your positive selfishness your dignified conduct as a human being this is the only way you can fight the bigoted enemy with his own ammunition like it or not he is forced to deal with you man to man the only criterion in your dealings being value for value an epitaph for nonviolence by dr nathan hare artly because of the j tfti l way wich nonvio vr f lence has been misused by negro leaders in the united states there are signs that that doctrine at least as we have known it up to nowis slowly but surely on its way out of the negros struggle these signs include the los angeles riots in which a violent form of civil disobedience or active resistance erupted in excess of the harlem case the year before then there are the deacons for defense and justice now emerging in the deep south the tolerance and treatment given the deacons by the press is in contrast to the persecution of robert williams and his lieutenants who sought to use violence in self defense in monroe north carolina some years ago however there are indications that the deacons are not as consistently radical as they may seem for example in a laudatory magazine article recently a picture showed them helping louisiana cops corral and control negroes but it is still a step in the direction of violence has given a measure of respectability to the use of retaliatory violence by negroes and helped to establish a new standard of militancy as a matter of fact only recently although after this article had been conceived a sncc leader revealed unsolicited by me that his group is dropping nonviolence for the most part because negroes in southern localities where they are being killed by whites no longer want to listen to a nonviolent ideology that is one of the main reasons he explained that martin_luther_king is moving his campaign to the north even there king may encounter difficulty dick gregory was shot in the leg when he tried to control los angeles watts negroes and being in los angeles at the time i even heard a middle class negro remark that they should have shot martin_luther_king in a certain portion of his anatomy this not only indicates a rejection of unilateral nonviolence it also reflects a budding inclination for negroes to choose their own leaders instead of merely accepting those approved and promoted by the white power structure and its press let us then consider the reasons behind the emerging disenchantment with nonviolence as we have known it so far one is that nonviolence has largely failed to bring a significant amount of measurable equality while there have been some conspicuous gains the negro has not progressedin spite of propaganda to the contraryin the manner that he must if he is to obtain equality in the next one thousand years my analysis of census data shows that while negroes gained occupationally during the forties when they were needed in war industries to replace job vacancies left by white soldiers they did not gain during the fifties in spite of the supreme court decree and the passive resistance movement negroes obtained some middle class tokenism the order of the day in every sphere including symbolic jobs such as air line stewardess symphony orchestra base fiddler and so forth but statistically as a group they did not gain on whites during the fifties the negro did move up some from his past position owing to changes in the economy but whites moved up faster maintaining the previous gap a census economist has found that the negros income is only about per cent of that of whites much similar to the ratio a half century ago in the area of school desegregation in the south more than nine out of ten negro students still attend segregated schools now more than ten years after the supreme court decreed desegregation with all deliberate speed border states have moved ahead with desegregation only to slip back into resegregation with previously allwhite schools swiftly becoming allnegro even in the north such cities as new york which at least three years ago had only one negro school principal philadelphia and chicago have about as much or more de facto segregation in the schools as they did in the year of the supreme court decision ironically aimed at the south studies at the population research center the university of chicago have revealed that there was no significant decrease in the amount of spatial or residential segregation in us cities during the fifties in fact chicago had the highest index of spatial segregation of any city in the world including southern cities south africa and the castes of india eleven oclock sunday morning is still the most segregated hour of the week nine out of ten negroes belong to allnegro denominations and most of the rest attend allnegro church houses prayins have failed to penetrate those earthly gates to heaven although more lipservice and in a few cases active participation was obtained from white preachers who left their allwhite churches now and then as in the selma march to join the negros civil_rights struggle as a matter of fact i for one was never more appalled than when five years after the montgomery bus boycott a greyhound bus carrying freedom riders through montgomery was attacked and burned in the first place i had been riding the front of the bus local as well as interstate practically all my life in oklahoma texas and missouri admittedly as some friends have pointed out that was not alabama but i do not believe that the difference would have occurred to me then my negro friends did not believe me even then except when they happened to see me in which case whites would look at me like i was crazy and negroes would look at me like i was crazy then head straight for the back sometimes mumbling such things as just want to start some trouble or just acting a fool i remember when i was ten years old holding up a bus which ran from bristow to beggs oklahoma for thirty minutes while the driver sought to persuade me to move to the back in a larger place the police would probably have moved me by force but in that small locality everybody knew that my mother would have come for them with her shotgun had they laid a finger on me anyway my policy ever after was never to move rear of center even if i had to stand while seats were vacant in the rear but drivers would roll their eyes at me and i would roll mine back at them and nobody bothered me except once that day i sat down beside a white farmer who had on dirty overalls i returning from a testing center where i had taken the graduate record examination was dressed in coat and tie the white farmer said to me why dont you go to the back where you belong i told him why dont you put me back there i had just won a golden gloves championship in oklahoma and was anxious to try out a recently perfected left hook but i could not aggravate him into saying anything else but enough of my personal experiences the important difference was that i was acting as an individual and any rebellion to be successfulwhether nonviolent or violentmust be a collective enterprise and is no better than its degree of organization however i used to wonder what would have been the impact if a majority of negroes had been refusing to conform even as individuals to the souths policies of segregation why then is nonviolence failing in the united states aside from the fact that it is unnatural to mans makeup most negroes have never taken part in a nonviolent demonstration and say that they could not remain nonviolent under fire nonviolence has been carried out in a hypocritical and dogmatic fashion many negroes instinctively realize that it is utterly american to fight back when attacked and they know that it is lawful even to kill a man in self defense negroes have been socialized into that cultural norm and are coming to see the curious contrast between nonviolence for them and the customarily unpunished killing of negroes including army majors in uniform by white southerners it is easy in this context to discern the inconsistency if not the hypocrisy of martin_luther_kings statement in his stride toward freedom that it is immoral for negroes to fight back when attacked by southern whites but that us efforts to violently deter an ideology such as communism is another thing incidentally king himself as told in the same book went down to apply for a pistol permit when his life was threatened during the montgomery boycott mind you the growing number of persons who question nonviolence have nothing against it as a tactic or strategem they merely believe that it should stay on that plane be put to use when that seems proper but abandoned when obviously ineffective and unjust the dogmatic approach to nonviolence heretofore is a result some say of the prevalence of negro preachers in the movement and the fact that negroes have tended to demonstrate a capacity or inclination to make everything a religion or pseudoreligion the new negro militants point to the fact that the oppressors justify the use of violence and even demand that negroes take part in wars of violence against persons who have never harmed them personally even a mississippi freedom democratic party bulletin has pointed to this paradox many negroes recall public school textbook accounts of the boston tea party where colonists with grievances boarded a ship and chopped up a supply of tea this brought up to date would be tantamount to a negro chopping up a lunch counter the new negro militant admires in the way that most americans are taught to do the speech of patrick henry when he stood and said give me liberty or give me death if a negro should stand and say that they would probably give him death the new negro militant familiar with history recalls the holy hell of the holy crusades when primitive christians took up the sword and used violence to persuade others to adopt a policy of nonviolenceto turn the other cheek then later while the negro was turning the other cheek they were kicking him on his other two and yet those persons now beginning to flirt with a philosophy of violence still reveal that they prefer a nonviolent approach accordingly as revealed in an esquire article the red chinese american negroes by william worthy a year or two ago they aim to squeeze the last drop of hope out of nonviolence and the similar though contrary to popular fallacy not equivalent tactic civil disobedience i should point out that many of the negroes that worthy one of the most militant negro journalists described as red chinese american negroes felt that he had sold them out linking their cause with the hated red chinese who lack respectability and approval in america and suggesting by implication as whites are inclined to do that negroes do not have native sense enough to structure their own rebellion but must always be moved by some other group anyway these negroes are beginning to advocate that we must forsake the kind of token civil disobedience we have known before and prepare for a policy of total civil disobedience the concept of total civil disobedience is synonymous with the general strike proposed by the classical social theorist georges sorel in reflections on violence james meredith while at the university of mississippi ole miss apparently came across sorels work he proposed a general strike but being misseducated pun intended thought that it meant negroes should designate a day and take off fifteen minutes from work however this is not even the equivalent of a coffee break what sorel meant by his general strike and what the slowly growing number of new negro militants have in mind is more extreme to use a favorite adjective of the white press the new negro militants propose that negroes passively resist participation in wars to preserve democracy so long as their government does not guarantee them democracy in their own land as a mississippi freedom democratic partys bulletin recently did refuse in the manner of the american colonists to pay the tax they owe so long as they do not have equal representation possibly refuse to work in the manner of south african negroes in the strike boycott the downtown area altogether stallin cars turn on water faucets and let them run put sand in the sewers and in general refuse to cooperate they long to bring this society to a halt to jeopardize its economy against negro rights and to let the world know that negroes will no longer obey or cooperate with a hypocritical and morally decadent society this attitude has occasionally infiltrated even civil_rights workers the march on washington for example had to be taken over by the white power structure who put moderate leaders such as martin_luther_king and roy wilkins according to an item in the washington post at its helm originally planned as a true march on washington to liein congress and tieup the capitols functions it became instead a jolly parade in washington with orderliness as its goal the white power structure told negroes how to march and when to leave a sncc leaders speech was censored so that a white catholic archbishop would agree to take part the proposed stallins before the worlds fair in new york came to an even more abortive fate as national leaders pushed by white contributions and control condemned the tactic as going too far the negro revolution is then unique in terms of world history in that white oppressors are allowed to tell negroes how and when to rebel new negro militants complain however the switch away from nonviolence is only dimly in sight in the first place talk always precedes revolution as it is necessary first that an oppressed group come to realize that a true revolution is essential this is occurringand will become more extreme in the futureas negroes increasingly reveal the other prerequisite for revolution a loss of faith in the feasibility of routine conventional means for righting the wrongs they suffer if it continues to seem necessary that negroes turn from token civil disobedience to total civil disobedience new negro militants are inclined to approach it with a hope for nonviolence but when and if they are met with violence let the chips fall where they may a white american faces his dilemma by ken jon booth three months of ira g the year that im away i from my classroom in denver i spend be hind the whed of a jolly jerry ice cream truck as i daily dispense bubble gum and ice cream bars i drive through neighborhoods with which im not familiar several days ago as i pulled up to the curb at the hail of a three year old my mind was busy with the guessing game that always follows is this little one a customer or does he merely want to pass the time of day for the ice cream man is every childs friend i was in luck for the young fellow finally managed to communicate the idea that he wanted the one with peanuts deciphering such a message is something of a feat i can understand my own all right but other peoples three year olds often are a mystery just as id wrapped the little fellows fingers around his change and admonished him to scoot home to mama before he lost it i looked up into a face that looked inquiringly at me didnt you go to north the young handsome man asked me i answered that i had and then recognized mike we shook hands warmly and exchanged last names which wed both forgotten mike was visiting denver from his new home in california after hed gotten the ice cream hed come for i invited him to visit me at my home while he was in town in fact i quite nearly insisted mike agreed to call the next time he was in town we said goodbye and probably will never meet again with one exception there is nothing strange about our meeting it can hardly be called a reunion for we hardly know one another the exception is this why should i have invited a school acquaintance i hadnt seen in ten years to my home and be so adamant about his acceptance why should i have been so much more delighted at seeing mike again than i would normally be about seeing an old acquaintance considering it i can find only two reasons and one of them makes me a little more than ashamed if mike has done any thinking about the matter then i should do well to be humiliated the lesser of the two reasons is that when we were in high school together i did like mike in our infrequent encounters the second reason has to do with such mixed and complex factors that they are far too easily summed up in saying it is because mike and i live in two different worlds and i feel guilty about it reflecting upon our meeting it seems to me that my effusive good will must have been a disappointment to mike for until then he possibly thought our differing colors meant nothing to me that of course is the impression i always seek to give for i have been told over and over again from childhood that the negro is very sensitive to any notice being taken of his color im sure my mother meant well in fostering that idea but it in no way changes the fact that such a thing is the rankest hypocrisy who but a blind man can fail to notice that someone is male or female black or white even so it is a part of my upbringing that cannot be erased from my subconscious at this late date therefore to me the negro will always be sensitive about color in connection with this i was taught that to inflict discomfort in any wayor to hurt anyones feelings was the vilest act of callous cruelty that could be done to anyone therefore my subconscious being an obedient thing to its teachings i must bend two fold backwards to avoid taking any note of mikes or anyone elses color isnt that foolish it is more than that it is pitiful yes pathetic if you will for it means that throughout my life i am completely helpless in establishing any sort of valid relationship with any member of a race other than my own i will be so afraid of offending or hurting someone that i will remain a sycophant always seeking to say and do the right thing ive kept these ideas out of my mind until recently for it is not a pleasant thing to admit to oneself that he is one of the very devils he has been trying to slay thinking back however i can trace the pattern easily my first contact with a negro was in an elevator in new york and in all innocence i told the gentleman your face is dirty and your mother will be angry with you i dont remember if the man smiled or answered for the shocked and horrible silence in the car filled with white people instantly informed me that i had committed a crime of some sort but i hadnt my own mother god rest her had she had never acknowledged the fact that there are peoples of different colors on earth to me any skin that wasnt white was in need of cloth and soap nothing was ever said about the incident but i have never forgotten it also the black man has fascinated me ever since just before world war ii we lived in pennsylvania and i began school in pittsburgh one of my playmates was a boy named sammy sammy was not a white boy but i had learned by that time that his face wasnt dirty mother had even gone further before i was enrolled at the school she had told me very patiently now kenneth there will be negro children in your school some people dont like them and are mean and hateful to them i dont ever want you to be unkind treat them just like you would anyone else now stop and reread that quotation which i can still hear twenty some years later the ears of a child are sharp and the senses of adults tend to dim but reading and hearing it again now i see an implication in those words so deadly that it is difficult to be charitable even to mothers good intentions for that bit of preschool advice carries with it so clearly the thought that you little white boy must be kind to these lesser beings now what ever gave that dear lady the idea that a child left to himself would treat one child differently from another what is the phrase unless ye become as little children i was a dutiful child when i struck up a boyish friendship with sammy i brought him home from school with me we had cookies and milk in the kitchen with mothers blessing that is until she walked into the kitchen poor mother what a look on her face she must have been thinking will this child of mine never stop taking everything i say literally its to mothers credit that she didnt mention the incident but then she didnt have to although i continued to play with sammy we did so on the playground and at his house for his mother never made me feel unwanted now that was in except for mike who i knew as a nodding friend in the halls at school and as a fellow entertainer i knew no one else of another race until i entered the university of missouri at kansas city in in kansas city i came to face the facts that denver is not representative of the relationship between white and black in denver there was a time when negroes sat in the back of the streetcar sat only in the theater balcony and did not visit the amusement parks or swimming pools gradually over the years the situation changed there is no longer any obvious segregation in denver what segregation there is is a subtle thing about which i know too little to speak the situation in kansas city then was something of a shock to me the university custodian constantly embarrassed me by calling me mr and sir he was i believe what is known as an uncle tom no amount of entreaty could change his subservience to me never would he call me by my first name as i asked him and he was forever doing demeaning tasks which were unpleasant for him and which i could and should have done for myself i must have tried to outwit that old man a hundred times but no matter where i hid my dirty ash trays he found and washed them no matter where i tucked away my lunch leftovers anticipating an opportunity later to dispose of them the old fox extricated them and bore them away with a smile i constantly expected him to break into a chorus of ov man river and beneath it all i knew he would see me in hell with no regret if ever the day came so it was i discovered bervin bervin was one of the crack debaters on the umkc championship team and we were in the same area of study taking my courage in my hands i arranged an accidental meeting between us one afternoon in my office it is the only time in my life that i dared to discuss the problem openly although the amount of time it took me to get warmed up and to the point must have been a trial for him the next few weeks were spent listening to bervin and asking questions but the most pressing question he couldnt answer and i havent been able to answer it satisfactorily myself what shall i do what is my part in this bervin did not know i think i do know but it is little comfort to me for the part i am able to play is so minutely small that its effect cannot be measured for years and it may by then be too late i can do about all that i am able to only by being honest with those negroes with whom i come in contact and by allowing my children to grow up without acquiring my prejudices i dont try to turn my daughter and sons against parsnips just because i dont think they are fit for human consumption have i any more right to influence my children in their reactions to other people so obvious a rhetorical question needs no answer very well then my job is to be the best father i can and to be honest one sunday while sitting with core at the kc liberty memorial i thought about this part that i can play it is not enough being a good father is a basic responsibility and duty sitting with core does not end hatred what is there for me to do ive asked this of many people but mostly of myself bervins answer was this theres nothing for you to do this is not your fight it is ours you can help by keeping out of the way youre a teacher arent you well then thats your job thats where you can help you cant change things by standing in front of your class and preaching against the outrageous things that have happened and are happening the only thing you can do is just what youve told me you try to do with your students to make them think and to make them seek truth in all things and bervin is perhaps right if i can make a few begin their searches for truth and to think well eventually come out all right prejudice and hatred exist where they are born in ignorance and fear but how many generations of my children must be bom and live and die before the stain has been erased from their minds how many more little children must die in church basements how many more must be cursed spat on and killed before all of our consciences can bear no more the negro is not the only one who suffers in this time of struggle and terror the bitter white suffers of fear and horror just as real the white who neither hates nor knows suffers indirectly from being deprived of what the two races together could achieve and as for me and those like me we suffer guilt and impotent rage because our own futile petty attempts to redress wrongs are far greater than our powers to cure them jc but from my ice cream truck i see hope true it is not a very great hope and its road ahead is a very long one but it has begun the hands that reach for my ice cream are black and white and tan and countless other hues they dont care who stands next to them nor who is first in line as long as turns are taken their purchases completed they return to playing in their yards with one another we have slowly come this far but i smile to myself as i drive through the streets for even with the for sale signs in groups and strips of tens and twelves the inevitable has happened billy has hit johnny with a fast right hook and their mothers talk it out over the back fence it isnt too impressive perhaps but what mother in the world would deny johnnys friend bill a place at the birthday table am i naive to think then that the way is before us am i but grasping at straws in my own desperation to spare my children from living with unfounded hatreds by believing that billy and johnny will always be friends when they have been neighbors as children i think not no i think not for all of our follies our blunders our stupidities and pettiness we yet remain that wonderful creature as ugly as he is beautiful as loving as he is brutal man and as long as we are part of man we must progress to better times and worlds i know i am mouthing the ideas of the people who maintain that we must let things alone and they will turn out all right i also know the young negro and white today do not want to leave things alone things should be made right and it must be done now youth has always thought so if it didnt we would still be a colony of england and even then there were those who said let us live side by side with the british and we will be friends but it did not happen a war was inevitable and only after it was foughtafter the blood was shed and many died and many tears fell into our souls and soildid we find the things which had bound us together all along the fact that we all were men if it must come to that let the time come soon so that we may at last get down to useful purposes and build together in the meantime be charitable and give us a moment in your thought we who are intruders in a world we have not seen and do not know and are drawn by that mutual bond of humanity and yet must ever remain bound to our pasts as a turtle to his shell how heavy those shells become at times and how we long to free ourselves from them how to open corporate jobs to qualified negroes by dr andrew f brimmer many corporaw tions are making an effort to recruit nesr es for management positions the success so far has been only marginal this result has come about partly because of the general lack of technical preparation on the part of most minority group members for the specific job opportunities which exist at the managerial level and partly because corporate managers are usually recruited at the junior level and advance on the basis of internally acquired experience clearly if the objective is to quicken the rate at which managerial opportunities for minority group members are opened this is a selfdefeating system thus some method must be found to increase the momentum while i along with everybody else have no panacea to recommend the following approach appears to be promising although few negroes currently possess the technical skills most in demand by corporations a relatively large number of negro college graduates have acquired educational and employment experience in fields not wholly removed from general administration among such fields are public and educational administration law mathematics insurance real estate and the social sciences for example in there were about nonwhites who had four or more years of college work of this about were classified as professional technical and kindred workers and approximately were managers officials and proprietors today these numbers are undoubtedly larger while the vast majority of these nonwhite college graduates are probably uninterestedor unpreparedto pursue a career in corporate management a substantial number may well find this attractive the big question ishow to convert such welleducated professionals into potential corporate managers as noted above initial entry in virtually every case is at the beginning levels which carry salaries too low to appeal to most non white college graduates with professional experience on the other hand the salaries earned by the great majority of nonwhite college graduates are by no means double the typical beginning salary paid to management trainees by corporations this fact seems to point to a promising vehicle to attract more nonwhites into corporate enterprise for example if an arrangement could be devised which would permit professionals with basically sound training in the social sci ences public administration and related areas to devote one year to a specialized graduate course in business administration a fairly large number might be able to make the transition into the corporation and assume responsibilities at the intermediate level in a number of areas a few fields seem especially promising eg personnel administration public relations marketing research and advertising with more investigation other areas may also be identified if such a plan were considered its feasibility would turn heavily on the solution of at least two basic issues in the first place the average negro professional already established in a relatively secure although perhaps lowpaying position may be reluctant to abandon his present spot to return to graduate school and then risk the problem of finding a job in an entirely new field thus it may well be necessary for a fairly large number of corporations to identify in advance a group of minority group college graduates with managerial potential these corporations might then have to commit themselves to providing a job opportunityat least on a trial basisfor the successful candidates to start after the oneyear training period secondly financial resources would have to be found on a fairly large scale to support the oneyear retraining experience while corporations themselves may well find it desirable to provide a portion of these funds it seems more likely that one of the leading foundations may consider this a worth while project while no firm estimate of the cost of such a project even on a modest scale can be provided several bench mark figures seem reasonable as a minimum one might want to avoid imposing a severe burden on the candidates family during the year of graduate study in the median income for nonwhite professionals in the social sciences was about thus a stipend between and per candidate for one year may well be sufficient to attract a fairly large number of highly qualified applicants if it is assumed that tuition and other overhead would add about to the sum required per candidate may well be between and thus to launch the program with candidates would require an expenditure of to in terms of the magnitude of many foundationsupported programs this sum is by no means out of the ordinary while such a program would clearly be a modest beginning it would be a beginning on a systematic basis its benefits would extend well beyond those derived by the individual candidates who would improve their immediate employment positions and by the corporations who would obtain competent employees the program would also demonstrate to minority group young people that expanding job opportunities in the corporate sector are a reality they could see in a relatively short period of time a growing number of members of minority groups actually acquiring managerial positions in corporations this visibility would have a feedback effect and would help to raise and reorient the aspirations of minority group youth it would also stimulate the revision and improvement of curricula at predominantly negro schools which increasingly would begin to prepare graduates to enter upon managerial careers along the ordinary routes established by corporations an examination of mission work in africa by wilton sankawulo image of the mism sionary in africa like indeed that westerner is to define thing the coming of the missionary into africa was contemporary with the coming of european political power which was drastic revolting and of course rewarding in many ways the missionary has unfortunately been classed with the politicians as imperialists by some africans their influence as a whole is suspect and the africans have been trying to remove what they believe to be unjust about it trying to be free from it wherever the question of injustice arises objectivity towards any particular problem is likely to be lost for the struggle for right like that of any cause is hard to be restrained from sacrificing even what is good in order to attain its goal the image of the missionary in particular presents a special problem for mission work is based on a theory of sacrificial selfgiving and the theological concept of human brotherhood reasonably enough anyone who cares about being realistic will admit readily that mission work more than any other foreign institution has made the most significant contribution to the development of africa im speaking in terms of the qualitativeand not primarily the quantitativeextent of it the mission work involves the whole man body mind and spirit this is principally the only reason for any success it may have but the fact that lutheran mission work for example could operate in liberia for a period of one century statistically producing about christians suggests that its success is not commensurate with the time the money and the effort invested into it the reason for this may be apparent in many ways or practically hidden to everyone it means that it is time for some reconsideration some analysis examining what mission work is like today and perhaps what it ought to be but it is a difficult if not exceedingly risky thing to do most missionaries at least from my experience and those supporting mission work would consider it reckless and ungrateful if an african man should do it but as plato said an unexamined life is not worth living and so it is only by running ultimate risks that one can look at things objectively discovering faults where they lie hoping to bring about improvement what missionaries are accused of today which is supposed to be a deterrent factor in mission work one that they themselves are first in admitting is the iconoclastic attitude they have somehow used and are using against african culture the question of imposing their culture has become a profound subject of protest to the africans this arises chiefly from a nationalistic spirit tinged with the africans quest to be free and to be himself selfacceptance is one basis for improvement where the self is denied something of a caricature emerges to represent it and because a caricature is not true to the self it misrepresents it destroys it ive met some africans who paradoxically deny their tribal origins even refuse to speak or write tribal dialects for them improvement means adopting a western identity but then the true self is selfwilled and will never easily yield to a foreign identity and so they have to surrender all the claims their origins have upon them and live with an identity not very clear to them this is painful ive seen many such africans deny their parents because they lived in the tribal tradition and the tragedy of this is that western society will not accept them on equal termsperhaps because they have very little in common misplaced and rootless they live by an illusion which they know as an illusion but they work restlessly in making themselves believe that the illusion is truth the amount of damage this can do to the self and the social problems it creates are unlimited it was the danger of this inescapable fact that persuaded missionaries and africans alike to believe that something peculiar of africa must be retained in her contacts with the rest of the world culturally religiously and politically most african writers and politicians would call this the african personality what this personality is what it should be is not known to everyone most africans i know take it to be the traditional way of living excluding everything that has to do with the west or the east but of course these africans would not stop using electricity spoons plates clothes cars etc made in usa to them who go so far with the west and still raise the question of their own uniqueness i would say you are raising this question in order to create conflicts of ideas and feelings for youre no different from a westerner in your mode of living african writers who are the intellectual supporters of this personality would write about the rain pelting on the jungle leaves the beauty of the gods the ancestral spirits and the mystery surrounding everything in africa not simply as things that exist but as the ideal things that exist for the africans this is perhaps why westerners today say lets leave them and their ways we shouldnt impose our ways upon them for they are too technical and advanced for them all they see now the best that can be done out of a bad job is to preserve africa as an area where they could go to study primitive tribes when they want to write new books in anthropology this is exactly what esther warner meant when she said that all missionaries ought to be anthropologists but if the missionary is in africa merely to accept things as they are without effecting any change then what is he doing there the african personality defined in this manner is completely reckless it remains a glorious mythas ezekiel mphahlele puts it it is a way of closing your eyes to what the rest of the world is doing change is the basis of all advancements even the west passed through the age in which evil was checked by exercising witches other ways more realisticthough not necessarily more successful as human nature is still the same had to be devised to handle the problem of evil to burn a man at the stake for instance because he differs with the popular belief is no more a common practice in the west when i advocate change here i dont mean blind adoption of western culture the chinese culture is very different from the western one but one cannot say as a rule that the western dish is better than the chinese dish if there should be a personality peculiar of africa in any way it must be one that will grow one that will relate itself with the rest of the world because africa is a part of the world it is exceedingly unrealistic to explain things in terms of african reality alone the time has passed for one social class to consider only those of similar attributes and persuasion as friends branding all others as foe merely because they are different as the animals in george orwells animal farm tried to do consequently i want the african personality that will in the first place accept its own heritage and fearlessly eliminate elements in it that are archaic and useless in coping with modern reality our music for instance could be organized analyzed and developed in its own right to the point where it would make its own impact on the world we need our bachs our beethovens we cant be satisfied with mere mediocrity our writers should stop praising the jungle its wild life and superstitions as though they constitute the apex of our civilization we cannot convince ourselves that this kind of life is all we need because the high rate of death the fear and insecurity superstitions bring together with the erosive havoc of ignorance disease and poverty all bear witness to how much we have to do on the other hand enthusiastic converts should never condemn the african traditions as a whole we have to accept our past with the idea of making improvement on it not for building a false monument to it or destroying it i want the african personality that will not be afraid to borrow from any quarters whether east or west in order to strengthen itself to enrich itself we must never imagine that there is a pure culture in the world just as we should never imagine a pure race western culture is not purely western it borrowed from every other culture western philosophy for example has some elements of the thoughts of confucius as well as maotsetung and some historians and anthropologists are united in saying that western civilization began on the shores of africa i would not hold it against missionaries for that matter when they attempt to put a stop to most of the superstitions and the primitive ways of living they encounter in africa all of this is not primarily done from selfish motives and it is our responsibility to correct where the intention has gone astray if we can face this as a fact if missionaries accept themselves as human and therefore fallible it is only then can mission work succeed in producing positive effects in africa james baldwin has said any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it the loss of all that gave one an identity the end of safety it is only when a man is able without bitterness or selfpity to surrender a dream he has long possessed that he is set freehe has set himself freefor higher dreams for greater privileges the only thing that would justify the agony of change and make it bearable is an adequate reason for bearing it at all what most missionaries have not cared about doing is giving adequate reasonsthe reasons they give are often tenuous for changing some aspects of african culture in order for it to cope with christian morality this finds a clear expression in the late albert schweitzers attitude towards the natives his work with them was based on the premise that they do not think profoundly and thus must be told what to do what to think without knowing the reason why in fact he went so far as to say that where the question of christian love is concerned he and the natives were brothers with the restrained observation that he was their big brother but the africans as far as i know are looking for friends and not particularly big brothers in breaking the bound of foreign rule they have become rather sensitive of domination of any kind even if branded with the name of christian philanthropy ive heard some of these natives say that anything done for them should be done out of love and not pity or pride it goes without saying that the question of honor if neglected in dealing with people soon makes itself felt in a crisis and ultimately negates every good intention and service a man would normally prefer to be poor rather than sacrifice honor and freedom for riches i remember a missionary who said to the africans in denouncing polygamy this is unchristian you see we missionaries practice monogamy because it is the christian way of marriage he left unsaid many other things which could have made his denunciation produce some positive effect rather than protest the africans were quick in recognizing that monogamy is practiced in the west by law and economic necessityfor there are many nonchristians in the west who marry one wife furthermore the bible does not incidentally condemn polygamy as evil he could have said for example that jesus christ advocated love as primary above all other considerations as one man cannot divide his love in the same way he cannot satisfactorily serve two masters it would be a travesty of the word to marry many wives pretending that he could possibly love them equally and well this is only a suggestion but the fact remains that he was preaching pure western civilization and not christian ethics the distance between western civilization and christianity today is not clearly defined i think this accounts for most of the difficulties in getting it across to nonwestern people another reason why the missionary finds it difficult to get his message across is that he goes into africa to occupy a managerial position train people and walk out of the job here my own view on mission work has been sharply opposed especially by africans most africans feel that missionaries should not go into africa to stay but to train them to be entirely independent and leave because the missionary has to be strict and firm in dealing with people if he is to accomplish anything he is regarded more or less like his political counterpart who must be obeyed who must rule and discipline people in order to get things done this places him in a predicament for he must use some measure of power as any leader must to fulfill his mission and those who are ruled do not usually take kindly to leaders who are strict the result is people who would rather leave the church and the mission if they disagree with the policy of a particular missionary leader like those who would leave their country when they dont like the president people who would say we need you only for your money and service but when we can take care of ourselves you should be gone in my own seventeen years of experience with the missionaries i have known them principally as leaders and because i have never lived as they expect me to i had to sustain punishments and disciplines of many kinds most of those i know who have gone through such years could not forgive them more than of those trained in the lutheran missions in liberia for instance have left the mission and the church to work for the government or some other institution of course we have to admit because they are human some missionaries have not used their powev with discretion in fact many of them never intended for the africans to be leadersa lot of improvement is now made in this direction with the rise of nationalism in africa and so we still look to the missionaries as masters some of these masters have long lived with the illusion that the africans must have a limited education in order to keep them subservient these missionaries do not want africans to think for themselves or meet them face to face as equals they build palaces among huts and forbid natives from entering into them new arrivals who begin to show an unrestrained delight in the natives are advised to be cautious in their dealings with them ive seen some missionaries who admit that they really dont like negroes their reason for being in africa wouldnt be anything other than to express the desire which is becoming a major problem for all of us nowadays to be somewhere else to go away from something and not for something when one talks about equality they think you want their money or houses or cars i would even be right to want these things because such would declare to the world that all the money put into mission work is mainly to help the poor helpless africans without saying that over half of it is for the missionaries convenience they of course would say this is necessary to keep them in africa but it is still true that they are using most of the money for themselves money collected in the name of the africans when i came to america nearly every american lutheran i met thought that he was paying for the very air i breathed the missionary in liberia would say that he cant feed us with spoons forever that is true but then why cant he be true to himself by saying that most of the money from his home is really for him and not us however i dont want their cars or housesfor i believe whatever one gets freely no matter how he got it is a stolen good until he pays the full price with his own effort or money so long as the moneyor some of itstill comes from their home the masters believe that they are in africa to be in control of everything and if they make an african a leader he is only their puppet even some of the few leaders they trained have no more than a grade school education and so must depend on them for any decision thousands of africans are therefore saying that this is pure imperialism imperialism however is too powerful a word because the missionaries unlike their political counterpart have not been working simply for profit this to me is the real reason for the lack of progress in mission work although missionaries are quick to attribute it to the fact that africans are animists for success in mission work those engaged in it must reckon with this fact missionaries should not go merely to direct manipulate and rule people but to live and work with them in love and equality here the peace corp program impresses me most the peace corps worker does not go out merely as a leader but as one who is willing to work with people as equals work where he is needed most if one does not work on this basis if one does not work in love and equality he is laboring for his own gloryin theological terms laboring under a curse i look for the missionary who would go out to work and live with people as equals in spite of the many differences in education social standards and economy this i believe will promote universal christian brotherhood or at least begin to promote it for this reason christian mission work should never end the christian missionaries in africa would represent christians in america and bear witness to the fact that christians all over the world are working together as brothers this would even promote international understanding and peace on earth this is what most africans dont want because they have always known missionaries as masters and the quicker the masters leave the better but it would be using them as a means to an end which is very unfairfor people are ends in themselves another important factor we must consider is that missionaries if they want to succeed in their mission must be themselves they are not going into africa to be africans or make people americans they can be united with africans in christ and not in culture it is becoming fashionable these days in the lutheran mission in liberia for example i mention lutherans often because i know them best other denominations could be mentioned in this category to take an african name wear african clothes and live like africans in some ways they have the right to do this out of curiosity but they have to make it clear that they cannot be africans and this does not mean that they despise africans the africans themselves must understand this when missionaries begin to show curiosity in their cultures the africans begin acting towards them as africans when the africans go to a point of no more advance they feel betrayed the missionary is going for a special mission like teaching or preaching or medicating and if he can fulfill this as best possible expressing love and respect for the people hes dealing with he has redeemed his pledge you dont have to be an american before you learn to love americans and vice versa missionaries must also report about the progress africans are making and not merely talk about their problems in order to raise funds africans are right when they become sensitive to the fact that their poverty ignorance and disease are reported more frequently than the tremendous progress they are making it would be unfair to tell the story of america in terms of what is happening today in alabama because it is always unfair to tell about the problems of people mentioning little or nothing at all about their progress the fact that we all have problems should make us more sympathetic make us love and appreciate one another more i realize that much of what ive said might not coincide with the popular imagination this essay is not a testimony of hate or bitterness i am deeply concerned about mission work and it pains me to see those receiving or giving these services taking unnecessary risks that are responsible for holding back its progress i have not raised all the questions or given all the answers my intent is that everyone concerned will begin thinking seriously in order that some of the dangers might be removed as much as that is possible the human element remains no matter what we do although certain failures have reduced goodness in man quite remarkably i still have confidence in mans capacity for clear thinking and righteous action love is the only hope for the removal of the dangers it was st paul who said that no matter what you do without love there is no gain in love we have to perform the greatest sacrifices for one another it is then and only then that we can hope and indeed expect to make progress in mission work and other undertakings designed to promote universal peace and brotherhood passage to an underground by ralph j gleason music has been v it the secret passage of jj many caucasian americans part way into the hidden underground world of the american negro if one possesses any amount of love for and is really involved in jazz music one inevitably confronts color true there are ways somewhat to avoid it one can be stareyed with show business or trapped by what lou gottlieb has called the music of obsequience but take even that past a certain point much less the involvement with the more outspoken contemporary jazzmen and the stark realities of american negro life not all but some hit you in the face go in far enough and its rougher the law is that the intensity varies in direct ratio to the depth of penetration in far enough and the soul truth is expressed generally as pure race and mother can cease to be familial term since the long hot summer exploded last august it has been impossible not to think of these things to have seen both the mime troupes ministrel show and leroi jones dutchman and the toilet on the same weekend was almost too much on one level the function of art whether it be jazz or poetry music drama or literature is always to help us to see and i can think of no better example of this truth than the blindness of the reaction to jones to the baldwin essays and to the minstrel show the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose baldwin wrote in the prophetic the fire next time leroi jones collection of angry animalistic teenagers in the toilet brings this to life the shocking thing is not the brutality but that a play which is so much a slice of reality should shock that set the boys room of a high school sordidly realistic wrecked by minority hatreds angry outbreak is the toilet of some high school we have all driven by its as simple as that to avoid looking at this lesson and learning from it because of false modesty about language is hypocrisy laid upon hypocrisy what word is used in that play that one has not heard before and survived curiously the realism is flawed the graffiti which exists on the walls of every unattended mens room in the country is strangely absent from the toilet though the actors use the words on stage no this play is real its mission high school in a sense just as dutchman is the jazz workshop andor north beach nothing in these plays is new but there are plenty of viewers to whom it is new itself no slight commentary the tragedy is in the attitude of the critics and censors who like chief parker in los angeles end up supporting the system which produced this frightening reality parkers remark were on top theyre on the bottom during the rioting will haunt him the rest of his life the minstrel show is another thing altogether it is neither shocking nor particularly instructive except that its another in the opportunities for black and white to laugh at each other together which is good it set out to be revolutionary theater and ended up great entertainment a lot of fun and more proof ronnie davis is a brilliant director it has however no point of view and really says nothing which marks it from all the other mime troupe productions baldwin and jones are telling us the building is going to blow up it is foolish if not tragic to allow shock at the form of that announcement to blind us to the reality of the danger all caucasians should see leroi jones plays they tell it like it is just as the jazzmen have for decades we need to listen and to understand their message nothing is more imperative reprinted from the san francisco chronicle needed a negro film movement by walter moore he cinema first of all rip g is an art it is a great art capable of utilizing mrs rvr its unrivaled technical superiority to convey ideas it is a unique art capable of illuminating the imagination of the spectator as well as making a profound imprint upon the concepts of the human conscious the great works of literature are transformed from lifeless white paper and black ink to be projected upon the motion screen as a living visual expression theatrical dramas are liberated from the narrow confines of the stage and indeed the world becomes a stage thus it can be said without a doubt that the cinema is of profound significance and is the greatest medium of expression in our modern technological society knowing these vast and vital benefits of the cinema it is disturbing to say the least that the negrohas made absolutely no creative contribution to this art it is a fact that while the peoples of asia and latin america have for years now been creating films there has not been one film made by negroes whether in africa the united states or the caribbean that is a film conceived written produced directed photographed and edited by negroes nigerian writer j koyinde vaughn adds further food for thought when he writes what attempts are being made to develop african cinema productions that will counteract decades of distortion future screen presentations of african life with the infinite possibilities of dramatizing both the past and african aspirations can only be successfully achieved by africans conscious of the great contribution we must make to the art of the cinema recently a short article published in negro digest asked why arent negroes in the business of making movies about themselves why no negro movies why sammy davis jr answers this question simply and eloquently when he says that there are twenty negro groups who could put a whole studio togetherbut they want to build a chicken shack instead of building a recreation center they build a church and gin mill but what would the reaction of audiences be to a negro cinema would it suffer the same fate as so many other negro endeavors this would depend upon the quality content and the techniques of these films but a reasonable and logical conjecture would be that these films if wisely constructed would probably be highly successful both artistically and commercially for the whole world has learned to appreciate the genius of the negro as an artist of rhythmic and plastic expressions the whole world has learned to appreciate the genius of jazz and since the cinema is a combination of plastic and rhythmic images and because of the worlds acceptance and recognition of the negros genius in these respective fields of cultural expressions it is easy to believe that negro films could quickly capture world popularity and could even conceivably dwarf declining hollywood and the rest of the world film centers the negro film however can only be this successful if it is artistically and technically prepared to compete with other films a negro film movement would closely parallel the independent film movement in america and the world today for the era of the big hollywood studios is over in this unique sense hollywood is dead this is the new era of the independent film maker unshackled from the dominance of the large complexes the independent producers are turning out the great pictures today the best example of these independent film makers are the mirisch brothers a few months ago the mirisch company celebrated its fifth anniversary in that time according to press releases the company produced eighteen pictures ie the magnificent seven irma la douce grossed one hundred million dollars and won sixteen academy awards behind every success story lies a reasona need discovered and fulfilled there can be no doubt that there is a great need for films about negroes if for nothing more than that we exist in significant quantity in the mainstream of world society this is a need discovered there are within the context of american society over twenty million negroes who would like to see films portraying us as significant human beings projecting our personality to the world we need a negro cinema which is capable of illustrating profoundly what we were what we are and what we are capable of becoming a negro cinema which would produce films which the white man would not and could not create honestly all we need do now is fulfill this need thus far i have stated the great need for a negro film movement but i havent offered any suggestions of how best to create one for besides being an art the cinema requires certain unique and specialized skills peculiar to the cinema again unlike an authors pen and paper or an artists oils and canvas the cost of producing a film is not negligible large sums of money must be invested even before the cameras began to turn this matter of economics accounts largely for the lack of a negro cinema the negro digest january main reason however is a lack of interest and our chronic dependence upon the white man to overcome this glaring obstacle interest in such a project must be motivated there should be formed a group of people with a deep interest in the cinema and a strong desire in spite of the many obstacles to see their dreams one day realized this group could seek out interesting ideas and topics to film discover talented negro thespians writers directors cinematographers and technicians it should then seek to secure financial backing in an attempt to turn out reputable films once the group establishes itself as being truly cinematic it could thus expand itself gradually to the point where it could turn out several feature length films annually if the group is recognized as turning out good quality films it will find itself in an easy position to secure financial backing to produce even more and better films thus this group could begin modestly and gradually rise to the position of turning out full length features of high merits and refined taste the rate of growth of this company would depend upon one thingthe quality of the films this is determined by the abilities of the artists and technicians skills and talent will attract the necessary financial backing it must also be understood that to produce a feature length film it is not absolutely necessary to have the multitude of technicians that are used on a hollywood sound stage this is only being eccentricit is a luxury rather than a necessity ingmar bergman uses only or technicians in creating his outstanding films therefore the first step is to lay a foundation by discovering negroes who have an aptitude for the cinema and a burning desire to create films and a great new art movement would then be borne the negro people who have so much to say to the world who have a great wealth of folklore and history will have at last realized and put to use the greatest medium of expression to tell a great storythe story of the negro we should act now a negro cinema is desperately needed for the millions of black peoples in america africa and latin america who would like to see realistic portrayals of themselves upon the motion picture screens of the world portraits ofa poevuu raconteur y pudlewrandall have not had many opportunities to talk to r great men and most of those occasions came to nothing either i would meet them as i was in a line of wellwishers and would be elbowed out of the way by the next person in line or after they had dropped a few perfunctory commonplaces upon me they would be swept to tea or cocktails by important people with m b tolson however it was different one night poetsculptor oliver lagrone telephoned me that tolson was in town and invited me to come and meet him i found him to be as langston hughes has described him a man who can talk to students cottonpickers and cowpunchers a great talkera very warm and human person with his bald head fringed by gray tufts over his ears and his seamed smiling face he looked like an oldfashioned preacher when he settled back in his chair took a cigar in his right hand and a glass in his left and remarked that tonight he would forget about jim crow and concentrate on old crow we knew that we were in for a night of good talk inasmuch as many critics have hailed him as a great poet but none has mentioned his supremacy as a talker i amgoing to enlarge on this aspect of his talent his style is expansive this may come from his many years at wiley and langston as a college professor with a captive audience or it may spring from his natural tendency to expatiate both his prizewinning dark symphony and his libretto for the republic of liberia are long poems and his page harlem gallery is only part one of a projected poem in four parts he is not a poet given to short swallow flights of song he never cuts through the bam when it is possible to stroll around it but during his walk around the barn he dispenses treasures of observation learning and humor culled from vast experience and reading an example of his indirect method as well as his socratic method of teaching by questioning is his anecdote about a white northern club woman who was distressed because a southern member of her club asserted that negroes steal chickens instead of abruptly denying this tolson asked did you ever see movies of a southern mansion with a huge dining hall and chandeliers and a linencovered table where old colonel sat to dinner with his family yes she answered and did you see a black butler in a white coat bringing in a platter of fried chicken balanced high in the air with one hand yes well black sam served the chicken and who cooked the chicken his wife i guess yes black mandy sweated over the stove to cook the chicken and who fed and watered and took care of the chicken his daughter i suppose yes little cindy raised that chicken and who grew the com and crops that fattened the chicken so the colonel could eat it the butlers son yes black junior toiling in the fields raised the corn to fatten that chicken but who ate the chicken by this time the clubwoman had begun to see the point and was smiling the colonel of course yes the colonel ate that chicken but somewhere on that plantation was a black patrick henry who said give me liberty or give me chicken now did the colonel give him his liberty no the woman answered with a smile then as tolson described with mockfreudian symbols how the slave captured the hen by tickling its rump with a long pole the woman shook with laughter and he says she was never again disturbed by the southern womans allegations that negroes stole chickens tolson could have answered her simply by saying that this was compensation for economic and social exploitation but instead of using the abstract jargon of the sociologist he dramatized the situation with the invention and humor of the poet another characteristic of his talk is his ability to adjust it to his audience i heard him on two occasions once when he was with a group of young poets and again when he was in a group of nonwriters on the first occasion he acted as a catalyst advising the poets to study and revise demonstrating for those who thought knowledge of technique would destroy their spontaneity that it would make their work stronger showing those who thought that they could not improve their first inspirations that they could make them better telling those pressed for time to write that he worked after midnight in the company of cats and owls admonishing them that poetry was performance and not propaganda he told many literary anecdotes he said the critic v f calverton praised him as having the potential of becoming the greatest negro poet tolson was nonplused and said you flatter me calverton replied why in hell should i flatter you tolson said that at breadloaf writers conference saul bellow called him subversive because the young poets would bring beer and hamburgers to his cottage at night and would sit on the floor listening to his anecdotes until the small hours and would oversleep and miss their sessions the next day tolson related that after com pleting libretto for the republic of liberia he asked allen tate to write a preface for it and tate replied that he wasnt interested in the propaganda of negro poets tolson spent a year studying modern poetic techniques and rewriting the poem so that it said the same things in a different way and then sent it to tate tate wrote a preface in which he said for the first time it seems to me a negro poet has assimilated the full poetic language of his time if the first version of the poem still exists it would be interesting to see it in a variorum edition with the rewritten version and to compare them one of the poets who was present that night wrote ill never forget mr tolsons marvelous mind and simple humility and absolute integrity tolson is modest about his achievements he admits that he began as a mediocre poet but developed his art by learning and experimenting he says that dark symphony is a good poem but not a great one at a lecture he read his poem my soul and i and after the applause had died down startled the audience by saying that was a bad poem you shouldnt have applauded he proceeded to analyze the poem phrase by phrase and line by line explaining where and how it was bad and how he had improved it by revision with the second nonwriting group tolsons talk was entirely different he did not refer to poetry at all except to remark that perhaps the reason he was unknown among his own people was that when white people want to hide something from negroes they put it in a book or a magazine since his host was a graduate of wiley college where tolson had taught and had coached the debating team he reminisced upon his experiences there he told of taking the team to the university of southern california and scouting the speech department which was as large as all of wiley college when he got back the team asked about their opponents and wanted to visit the campus he told them theyre not so much well visit them after we win the debate just to show them were good sports little wiley college won the debate tolson has great gusto as a talker the night met him lagrone and i left early as he was convalescing from a major operation but we found out later that he had learned that james farmer one of his students was in detroit and telephoning until he located him he had gone out and spent the night in talk and had not returned to his sisters home until five oclock the next morning at his home in langston oklahoma he formed a zulu club like the zulu club wits in harlem gallery where men meet to discuss and exchange ideas chapters have been formed in various cities across the country they are composed of men of all occupations from professional men to laborersanyone who is interested in reading thinking and exchanging ideas in his conversation he hints of some day writing his autobiography the life and times of m b tolson retired now from his position at langston university he occupies a newly created chair in humanities at tuskegee institute with only one class to teach it will be profitable if he can use his newfound leisure not only to complete harlem gallery but also to write his memoirs as they should be invaluable for the humor the recollections of literary figures and the record of the poetic development of this gifted poet and raconteur karens spring by eloise greenfield maren splashed the suds listlessly over the m dishes humming h cheerfully for the ss benefit of larry who was reading in the living room she wondered that she had been able to fool him these past weeks he always recognized the symptoms of her doldrums and it was part of their closeness that he waited until she was ready to tell him the reasons and she always did but this time she couldnt she couldnt say to him i dont want our baby our baby that weve talked about and planned for these last eight monthsand even before she looked out at the perky april greens and pinks and yellows but felt only weariness she used her arm to push a black curl back from her forehead just last month she had felt at one with spring had felt the joyousness they shared of life within preparing to bloom karen and phyllis her friend who lived in the apartment across the hall had spent the winter happily comparing prenatal progress and exchanging books on baby care and looking forward to this special spring i counted twelve blades of grass and seven leaves on the way to the store phyllis had come by to tell her one day in early march spring karen had sighed and they had grinned proudly as if personally responsible for the birth of the new season but now she hated spring and she hated blond blueeyed phyllis whose baby would be born into a world of open doors and welcoming arms while restrictions and insinuations conflict and frustration would be waiting for her brown one karen loved the negro colors the golds the blacks the subtle shadings of tan the photograph or painting of a face evoked in her a strong sense of identification an almost physical leaning toward the likeness of her people she loved the full expressive lips which reflected in the men and women the depth of their feelings and in the children the sweet petulance found in all children but how could she bring something she loved into a world of so little love each morning for the past three weeks karen had awakened with a guilty feeling and the thought today ill visit phyllis but each hour came and went with the excuse that it was too early or too late she was too busy or tired or outofsorts the prospect of listening once more to the confident plans phyllis had made for the babys future was more than she could bear and now with phyllis almost a week overdue she still hadnt seen her it was hard for her to face this new hostility in herself she didnt want to hurt phyllis and she did want to hurt phyllis she felt that she could stand by and watch with grim glee as phyllis plans fell through one by one and it was with horror that she realized the strength of this emotion shed been angry before of course but it had always been directed at them the conglomerate them who greeted her coldly in the department stores who on television questioned her right to live fully who used her for political power was it the deeply protective feeling she had for the child inside her she wondered that had intensified and personalized this anger so that now when she most needed to be warm and loving she had become almost inhuman she thought back to her own mother love is all thats needed karen she had said love and forgiveness karen picked up the terry cloth towel and began to dry the dishes i hope its a girl she thought its the men who have it the hardest karen larry called from the living room the firmness of his voice sent a nervous ripple through her stomach and the baby kicked once as if in protest ill be through in a minute she answered she dried the last plate and slowly closed the door of the paneled cabinet okay now larry said taking her hand as she sat down beside him what is it what is what karen asked brightly youve been upset for weeks i havent bothered you before because i knew youd tell me but you havent larry theres nothing wrong with me she insisted and saw the hurt start around his mouth rise to his eyes and change suddenly to anger you dont eat he said in a hard voice you constantly hum those same three notes you havent been to see phyllis all right karen interrupted ill visit phyllis if itll make you happy she slammed out of the apartment to escape his hurt and the questions across the hall she paused at phyllis door before knocking wondering how she should explain her prolonged absence hi karen come on in phyllis said dully and karen could see that she had been crying karen looked toward the bedroom as she took the chair by the window is bob home she asked not yet phyllis answered hes working late tonight she lowered herself carefully onto the sofa howve you been karen asked she realized with a shock that during the time she had been avoiding phyllis phyllis hadnt visited her either just fine except ive been in an awful mood i didnt want to inflict on you she gasped suddenly and gripped the arm of the sofa youre in labor karen said rushing to her no no im not phyllis said bursting into tears but you are phyllis whats the matter with you have you phoned bob no i cant i dont want the baby phyllis said hysterically releasing her grip on the sofa karen stared at her you dont dont you see karen its cruel to bring a baby into a world like this to grow up in a world of wars and murders and hate and maybe itll be better for our children karen said realizing the inadequacy of her words but desperate to convince phyllis before the baby arrived that she really did want him it was suddenly very important to her that his birth be an experience of joy and wonder and not of resignation how can it be phyllis asked calmer now but with hopelessness whos going to make it better we will karen said as much to herself as to phyllis well make it a better world well write letters see our congressmen well join other people who are doing things she got phyllis bag from the bedroom and set it down near the door you and i have wasted nine whole months dreaming and drooling karen continued preparing a room a layette a crib but not a wrorld in which our children can live love is not enough we have to work too now call bob and tell him to meet you at the hospital ill get larry to take you karen phyllis called as karen started back to her own apartment thanks thank you karen said silently thank you phyllis judahs a twoway street running out by jack burris lay looked up from the newspaper when the figure passed recognized it as a woman from his neighborhood and started to smile but then he saw the ice in her eyes remembered he was a cityboy now and reraised the newspaper thats the trouble with them niggers he thought addressing to himself the words he had so often heard spoken about himself and others they dont stick together aint got no gumption less you wave a relief check at em who me boss he answered his own charges amused by the game now that he no longer had to play it heck boss not me all wants to do is sit here in the back of the bus and ride out to judah street so i can get me a job thats all want honest boss then ill go home and eat my watermelon and dance in the mud and sing my happy songs for you and then maybe tonight ill poke a pickaninny up the old lady if she aint too tired from scrubbin yore floors an stealin yore food honest boss thats all i want except that wasnt all he wanted and they would spot the lie quickly enough and bring him to account or maybe not maybe this time they wouldnt or maybe they wouldnt even care that card was due to come up too claire mae had promised the least he could do for her was sit there in the back of the bus and ride it out even to the last stop if he had to go that far only he wasnt really on the back of the bus of course he was sitting in the front seat of a streetcar where he always sat or at least as often as he reasonably could claire mae had teased him about it had asked him if he thought he was proving something to somebody and he had answered that the only thing it proved was they were living in san francisco now and he supposed any blackass fool could tell that quickly enough just by looking out the window he still sat at the front of buses though knowing that there would be time enough later for indifference looking through the hairoil smeared window he carefully checked the address given in the newspaper against those painted on the windows of the stores they were passing two more blocks he decided and lifted his arm preparing to pull the cord that would signal his desire to stop he hesitated though not knowing exactly where the streetcars next stop was and not wanting in his eagerness to be forced to walk those last two blocks just because hed signalled too early while he waited undecided he felt the cord sliding through his slippery fingers and heard the bell tinkle in front of him surprised and even mildly disappointed he stood up immediately and walked toward the doors at the back even though he had to fight against several people who were forcing their way to the front theres time enough for me to do that later too he thought pausing to let an old woman step before him today im going to obey all them dumb ofays rules stepping down he quickly spotted the building in the next block that was his destination claire mae had described it well that morning just as she had carefully described the whole neighborhood for him she had done so partially to avoid his getting lost again as he had done when he first went downtown to look for work but he knew her detailed description had also come from her nervousness her unspoken desperation hed spotted that quickly right at the start when shed looked up from ironing his shirt and said in all seriousness youll recognize judah easily enough its a twoway street running out to the ocean hed wanted to stop her then to ask her mockingly how many ways the street ran when it came back from the ocean but she was too painfully intent to interrupt still too aware of the fact that it had been at her suggestion that they had moved to san francisco back to the city of her childhood anyway it was because san francisco was her city that he had been willing to listen too grateful for any information she might offer however humorously expressed to risk losing it and the security it might later give him one thing you can say about me i never tease the hand thats feeding me no sir not me boss thinking about hands he took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his own hands while he was walking look ma look how good you taught me he thought remembering now without any real resentment how his mother had told him to always wipe his hand on the inside of his pocket before shaking hands with a white man she hadnt said it in words but she made him understand that even a simple thing like sweat which on another white man would be ignored on him would be magnified once after shed died and before claire mae had found him hed worn pocketless pants carefully cutting the right front pocket out of each new pair that he bought willingly sacrificing the convenience for the sake of the joke but that was before claire mae she wouldnt see anything funny in it at least not as long as she was working in a white mans house every day to pay for those pants so now he left the pockets in and carefully wiped his hands on a handkerchief lo how the mighty has fallen the door was locked when he tried it he gave it a second try to make sure then checked his watch the ad had said ten oclock so he had almost twenty minutes to wait he considered going to search for a coffee shop but then balanced that against the impression he might give if he were standing there when the owner arrived yes suh boss ahs always early yes suh and no cavities either he decided instead to have a cigarette even though there were only five left in the pack and they had to last the day he was still standing there in the doorway enjoying the smoke and the warmth of the early sun when he saw the other man approaching he recognized the man as a neighbor of sorts in that he lived somewhere in the same overfilled apartment building clay had seen him sometimes when he was climbing the stairs or emptying the garbage and the man usually dressed up as though for saturday night would pass silently by their eyes always failing to make contact it wasnt that the man was unfriendly he knew but simply that in that house the only privacy to be had was in refusing to recognize people maybe you had to listen to your neighbors television and kids and fights and screwings but you didnt have to recognize those neighbors when you saw them not even in broad daylight on the stairs the man had stopped looked first at the address on the door then at clay and finally nodded hi man hi clay answered smiling and offered his hand im clay carter live on the third floor back apartment the man nodded again and gave him a smile in return clay noticed the mishapen goldcapped teeth thought i recognized you im william potter only call me billy like in goat im staying with my sister and her old man up on the top floor he smiled again this time without the show of teeth only i wont be tomorrow less something turns up clay nodded this time then watched as the man lit a cigarette hed already noticed the mans frayed shirt dirty at the neck and the lack of a crease in the trousers of his black suit been looking long four months billy said before that i had unemployment so i took it easy man i didnt know when i was well off i had this job deliverin diapers see only i didnt think it was good enough not for a college man so i quit hell i had to learn now man id pick up them dirty diapers with my teeth theyd let me this is only my second month clay said but i know what you mean i got a wife working so i guess it aint as bad but were just gettin started out here so far it aint been much of a start man dont you worry none aint you heard about the presedents new bill he gets that passed man were gonna have rights up the ass wont even have to work just go pick us some money off that moneytree marked niggers only sure only watch out for the man hes behind that tree somewhere and hes got him a shaft marked niggers only too dont you believe that man why i heard govnor wallace just last night said them dirty coonsll be pickin the money and the white folksll have to pick the cotton aint that a shame man i cried all night clay laughed enjoying his new friends gestures as much as the words wonder who theyll burn their crosses for then why them dirty commies of course theyre the ones startin all this fuss anyway them cottonpickin niggers wasnt causin no trouble until them yankee commies started in i thought the niggers and the commies were one and the same no billy said theyre different them commies are sort of bleachedout niggers see didnt you hear about dr dejone hes the head of the science department down there at good old georgia u or someplace like that and he wrote this book provin that all commies are just washedout niggers something about the curse of god and ham and small heads i didnt read all of it but it was something like that clay flicked the butt of his cigarette out over a parked car and into the street he checked his watch saw that they still had almost five minutes to wait and leaned back against the wall of the building billy was trying to look through the window cupping his hands around his eyes to shut out the outside light i think theres somebody in there must of come in the back door clay said you think we have much of a chance yeah man the best aint we niggers man and aint this old niggerlovin san francisco hell soon as that old white boss looks at us hes gonna say coons youre both hired clay laughed trying to hide his nervousness i guess we can always threaten to picket them picket hell im gonna tell them if i dont get this job ill have old buddy marty come in and pray for them hey watch out man here comes that little old white chick to let us in um um wouldnt my brother like a piece of that the secretary who had let them into the office also explained to them that mr robertson would be a little late and then helped them fill out the application forms then when these were completed she showed them two chairs where they could wait at first clay had found her attractive but the more she talked in her phony dead voice the more he lost interest he was grateful to her for her kindness but he wondered how soon he would hate her if he had to work in the same office dont worry about that man you aint got the job yet although she had given them some magazines to look at while they waited clay couldnt get interested in them instead he watched the men moving back and forth in the back part of the office he noticed that there were no negroes but he couldnt decide if that were a blessing or a curse maybe they would hire him just to prove their tolerance but on the other hand maybe they were planning to wait until they absolutely had to before they gave in three other men all of them white had come in since he had been sitting and the secretary was helping them through the problems of the application forms clay watched them closely trying to balance his own qualifications against theirs they were obviously in less dire needotherwise they couldnt have afforded such clothingbut he refused to think about that for long having given up the idea of poeticjustice along with his diapers he overheard them listing some of their qualifications but not enough to influence him one way or the other he finally gave up the game concluding only that two of them might give him some serious competition the third man who was still a pimplescarred youth he threw into the reject file in his mind where he had much earlier placed billy potter mr carter clay tried to locate the source of the voice turning his head slightly he saw a large middleaged man in a grey doublebreasted business suit he was holding an application form and clay recognized it as his own yes sir clay answered quickly standing up and moving toward the man im mr robertson the man said offering his hand oh sorry mama but this cat aint goin to give me no time for wipin okay ofay have some sweet sweat how do you do sir would you come this way please clay followed him the office door had the name mr abraham robertson printed on it in gold lettering abraham huh like from the bible well abraham i aint your isaac so dont go gettin no ideas i done played that game abe all my life honest abe l just want a job honest abe clay sat down on the edge of the politelyoffered chair refused the cigarette that he needed so badly his mouth watered at its sight and smiled thanking god that there werent any gold caps on his teeth mr robertson pretended a fascination with the application form letting him cool his heels clay supposed hey you dumb ass im over here not on that piece of paper the message must have been received for mr robertson looked up startled i see you have an ma yes sir you realize of course that the job which is open doesnt require that kind of ability its only an accounting position yes sir i know that but i thought that perhaps it would be a good place for me to start the ofay smiled youre not too humble to start at the bottom dont give me that jazz man you want me to clean your toilets for openers show me the brush no sir to be quite frank i need a job ive only recently moved to san francisco from the south and im finding it a little difficult to get started is that begging mama okay so now im a beggar next week start peddlin the dope yes i see that on your application form i dont recognize your college mr carter its a negro college in alabama sir oh clay felt the irritation rising in him like an erection hard against his gut oh is that all its going to be white man just oh one little word not even of sympathy but merely indifference and then the door you think wanted to go to that friggin little school you think i couldnt have made it at harvard if vd had the chance his fingernails cutting into his palms brought him back in time to realize he had missed a question i beg your pardon sir i asked if what youve listed here is your total work experience yes sir it is you see i only finished college last year and then we moved out here oh yes i see four words this time but they amounted to the same clay couldnt even feel the irritation now it had dissolved blending with a thousand past irritations leaving him with only a sour taste in his mouth the interview was over he knew and he was out as usual now all that was left was the long ride to the end of the line that long ride he had to take for claire mae not for himself because he already knew yes sir he said quickly answering another useless question yes sir mr robertson yes sir you are absolutely right capn only come on daddy dont drag it out kill me quick abe aint no sense messin around aint gonna be no savin message from god this time when he phoned claire mae from the bar later she took the news pretty hard she didnt agree with him as she usually didbut you dont know yet clay not reallynor did she bother asking him what he was doing in a bar when he could be looking for work in other places she just said all right as though it was a kind of vocal shrug and then said shed see him that night when she finally came home though she was feeling better evidently her work that afternoon had smoothed away the edge of her disappointment just as the liquor had smoothed away his because she listened patiently to the details of his explanation then embraced him and said it doesnt matter hon somethingll turn up tomorrow maybe right here in fillmore cant every boss in this city be a white twofaced bastard she fixed him a steak for dinner singing all the time she was cooking to show him she still had faith and while they ate they talked confidently of the future of the house they would someday buy and the children they would raise and the trips they would take and if anybody can make it all happen guess claire mae can he thought smiling inwardly at the strength of her determination when they were watching television the newscaster mentioned that the presidents civil_rights bill was having trouble in the house but that it still seemed a sure thing to pass he felt claire mae touch his arm while the man was talking but whether it was to give him confidence or to seek some from him he couldnt determine they sat there huddled together as though for protection while the little white men danced in blackandwhite before them laughing together when the occasional lone negro passed by in the background they can hire me for show too if they want if aint black enough for them ill even put on a little mantan claire mae as though sensing his thoughts leaned against him he unbuttoned her blouse and rested his hand beneath it when she didnt pull away he started working on the bra as well clay there was no warning note in her voice only a kind of questioning yeah i thought you wanted to watch this show screw that show lets go to bed she sat upright then forcing his hand away but she was smiling i aint done the dishes yet screw them too she laughed man you do all that screwing you aint going to be much use to me you try me he said reaching again for her she caught his hand and kissed it i got to get that kitchen cleared up first them cockroachesll carry the whole house off if i dont and i need me a bath too you hintin at something me course not makes sense though that if you took care of the kitchen while i was taking me a bath wed both get to that bed faster dont it he lunged for her laughing but she beat him again jumping up and heading for the bathroom you aint out of that tub time i get ready im climbin in with you he yelled after her she paused long enough to give him a smile then disappeared behind the bathroom door clay turned the television off finding some consolation in shutting up some stupid ofay right in the middle of a sentence the kitchen really wasnt too bad there were only a few dishes on the table to clear away he knew there wouldnt be enough hot water to wash them since claire mae was running it for a bath and so he only wiped at them the best he could he heard her singing in the tub and he tried to hum the tune along with her as he worked but he heard himself go offkey and quit heres one nigger that cant carry a tune boss cant do much of anything else either seems like he was looking out the kitchen window and down onto the halflit street while he rinsed and stacked the dishes he saw the figure of a man get off the bus at the corner he thought it was billy porter but it wasnt until the man started to cross the street that he was sure hed forgotten about his neighbor just as hed forgotten the interview during the long drinking afternoon but now that he saw him again he wanted to talk with him if for no other reason than to compare notes on the mornings embarrassment he searched for some excuse saw the sack of garbage heaped to the level of spilling and grabbing it rushed out into the hall he was too quick he heard billy just starting to climb the stairs as he dropped the bag down the chute and so he had to wait emptyhanded so maybe hell think im waiting for him i dont give a damn i am hell want to see me too only natural hes probably just as disappointed as i am and he doesnt have a wife fixing herself up just for his pleasure clay heard the song then the tune climbing up the stairway like an echo of the footsteps and it bothered him he heard in it not sadness not disappointment but a quiet joy of contentment what if he got the job the question rattled inside his head knocking aside all the old defenses spawning other questions in its flight what if billy the rejected of clay had been the accepted what would claire mae find to say in consolation then how could an ofay be a bastard if clay clutched the end of the handrail and watched the figure of the man climbing like a black christ rising from a tomb to announcewhat what will he announce what new joyous disaster the tune danced in the still air to the rhythm the footsteps beat out in warning no oh my god not that too the black face was first to reach the level of the hallway looking like a dark moon against a pale horizon and as clay watched in fear the tiny internal smile spread broadly in recognition hi man hi clay answered forcing his voice to sound casual hey you sure sound happy enough hell why not i got me a job man so the drum warnings had been of doom and he hadnt prepared in time what did it matter though he had built the only defense he had the only kind he knew and if it wasnt enough yeah hey thats great man i didnt think that dumb ofay could even see us niggers there in that dark office him mr robertson hell man he couldnt that aint where got my job i got back on at the diaper factory clay laughed chasing the terrors away again by his sheer volume yeah hell i thought for a minute youd gotten the other job nah billie answered smiling he seemed puzzled by clays outburst hell i called them this afternoon pretended i was somebody new you know like i hadnt been there this morning they told me it was already filled they must have taken one of them dumb ofays that was standin there when we was there clay smiled finished with the topic now that he had found his fears to be groundless well im glad you got you a job anyway thanks it aint much but itll pay the rent they stood there quietly as though neither of them was sure how to break away clay looked past billy down the stairs looking intently at the door as though the outside world were waiting there like a puppy whimpering to be let in fog must be coming in he said i felt it a minute ago nah its clear out billy answered clear as a virgins conscience they shared a laugh and then clay shrugged must be me then i sure thought i felt it coming in billy didnt answer he stood quietly another moment still a few stairs from the top then started climbing again moving past clay well guess i better get on up that sister of mine may even feed me tonight she hears the news fore she starts thro win things okay man see you clay watched the back of his friend as he climbed the stairs on up to the next floor sharing with him for a moment a genuine pleasure for his new job tomorrow may be my turn he thought promising himself and claire mae or at least the next day its got to come sooner or later if we can only wait long enough the footsteps if they were an omen were fading fast now so they no longer seemed threatening they stopped a door opened and then closed quickly again clay smiled wiped his sweating hands down across his trousers and started back to his own apartment back to claire mae who he knew was still waiting in the dark and wide bed to give him comfort by don shepherd rofessor roberts squinted at the top of his dresser finding he put made a tie his glasses on and to j his y his pipe and stuflfed them in this pocket and walked down the hall toward the stairs at the first landing the professor wiped the steam from the window with his hand and peered out it was a dark windy morning and the rain was beating heavily against the window usually on mornings such as this he savored the warmth the glowing lights and the breakfast aromas that permeated the house but this morning the weather vaguely registered in the professors mind for he was preoccupied with matters concerning the hatcher theory the professor entered the dining room and was disappointed to find it empty sitting down he brushed aside the morning paper and sipped his orange juice it was strange he thought for years he and his colleagues had laughed whenever anyone mentioned professor hatcher he remembered that when he first started teaching zoology one of the standard jokes in his lecture on genetics concerned hatchers theory it seems the professor mused that ol hatcher has had the last laugh he picked up the paper glanced at the headlines and put it down again say he called isnt there anyone in the house breakfast will be ready in a minute dear his wife called from the kitchen where are the kids theyve already gone to school the professor looked at his pocketwatch how do you like that he said to himself my great hour of triumph and theres no one around to help me celebrate again he picked up the paper and glanced at the front page his wife entered from the kitchen carrying a plate of eggs and a pot of steaming coffee good morning dear she said the professor looked up and smiled the kids left earlier than usual didnt they yes its quite bad out this morning and they had a chance to ride to school im sorry i missed them i wanted to talk to them this morning well thats a new one said his wife generally you just growl at them in the morning oh come now have i really been that bad the professors wife poured him a cup of coffee youve been a real grouch lately do you realize how long youve been working on this project its been quite a while now its been thirteen months the project was going along quite smoothly until you got the invitation to speak before the world congress ive hardly seen you at all since then i know emily its been hard on you and im not thinking of myself jason youre going to ruin your health with this ridiculous pace youve set for yourself the nuclear destruction of the lost civilization has been a mystery for thousands of years surely the world can wait a few more years for the answer yes said the professor its just that i felt that some discovery would justify my being chosen over so many others to speak before the congress but you dont have to find anything new you were chosen for your past accomplishments well anyway said the professor it was worth the effort i have some astonishing news to announce the professors wife looked at him at amazement you mean youve discovered something the professor smiled yes he said we broke the code to their alphabet and finished the project about three oclock this morning most of the vestiges that we have so far are of little use to us but curiously enough that little plaque that we found in the southern part of the continent a couple of years ago has proved to be extremely valuable the one we found on our vacation said his wife excitedly tv right said the professor the paint on the plaque had contained leadpigment with the aid of chemicals we brought out the figures quite clearly last night we translated it and it read this entrance for white people only the professors wife drew a sharp breath the hatcher theory she said right again said the professor with this plaque and in view of previous findings we have conclusive proof of the theory presented by the late professor wilber hatcher a couple of thousand years ago probably around the twentieth century there was indeed a race of whiteskinned people on the earth professor roberts paused and continued this seems also to substantiate our theory that their cultural development did not keep pace with their scientific progress i would guess that our ancestors discriminated against these people simply because their skin was white pigmentation by dr carl a larson rouse life light must meet color in the sterile vastness of space where light meets light stars and planets roll empty and dead plants of our earthen soil and seas use pigments green and yellow and red to capture light and turn its energy to build sugars and compound foods for vegetable and animal life the minutest freeliving cell with a simple eyespot has pigment to receive light and elicit small voltages necessary for goaloriented motion without coloring matter or pigment life as we know it would be extremely poor or extinct then an intense and widespread interest in pigment is natural and selfexplaining an enlightened public thirsts for knowledge about the wonders and the hidden meaning of color in the course of human affairs facts from laboratories and the fields of observational research are grasped by the eager hands of men and women striving to bridge the gaps of fatal ignorance and group rancor well yes but a yes with a few shamefaced qualifications when it comes to human pigmentation interest grows worldwide indeed but the source of that interest is not always respectable or even presentable some people think they know a mans dreams his thoughts and his skills when they know his color we need not respect such delusive reasoning nevertheless whatever its source factual knowledge about the meaning of human diversity would help us see wherefrom we come and whereto we go we know much about blood pigments and gall pigments we understand a little about the part played by light absorption in the immense drama of life and so we could expect the widespread interest in skin pigmentation to have crystallized into some knowledge of gemlike clarity this is not the case we have a series of facts that is true but they admit of very limited conclusions when the origin and advantage of diversity in skin color are concerned the deviations from normal pigmentation have however long challenged the medical profession partial changes of hue especially in the face on the neck and arms meet little love today and in times past white spots in tan faces caused much alarm because they were frequently taken as signs of the dreaded and poorly understood lepra or leprosy now better called hansens disease to avoid derogatory associations the pigmented bearers of ancient civilizations indians and egyptians knew remedies against such depigmented spots thus atharva veda the sacred book of india from about b c prescribed certain black seeds against white spots this sounds like magic likeness in color would transfer a property from the remedium to the patient but hints of early and accurate experience of successful treatment are provided by folklore and late observations to the former type of evidence belongs the ageold use in india and egypt of a plant ammi majus for the cure of white spots the roots of this plant were chewn and the effect in the form of pigmentation came forth after the exposure of the skin to sunlight now the active substance of the plant are known and used in treatment of the annoying spots the effect is often slow and irregular it is not free from dangers and should never be undertaken without medical advise and supervision the second pointer to experience behind the idea of swallowing something to cure a skin condition might be found in the observation of nutritional disturbances with loss of pigment now and then an observant medicine man might have come upon a drug that either ameliorated a malnutrition or seemed to have an effect because it happened to be taken together with the adequate food to illustrate in africa nutritional diseases with the local names buaki mbuaki and diboba go with loss of color here as well as in the more widelyknown kwashiorkor an unbalanced proteindefective diet lies at the root of the disease when the deficiency in the diet is corrected normal pigmentation returns this also applies to the sometimes observed pigmentary changes in vitamin a deficiency uneven pigmentation and loss of pigment are mere signs of unbalanced diet in such disorders today protein starvation sometimes masked by a relative abundance of carbohydrates is a great killer of infants and children and stealer of strength in adults in many young countries protein starvation results from a lopsided agriculture an analogous situation obtained in the southern part of the united states where pellagra was widespread until the late thirties and early forties when it virtually disappeared helped by an increased understanding of this niacinamid malnutrition the improved food supply eradicated the disease the depression made cotton unsaleable and acreage for diversified food production was freed a late result of pellagra in many darkhued people was a patchy blanching of the skin in pellagra in other nutritional deficiencies and in disorders of the skin with other origin more or less striking pigmentary changes in the opposite direction occur endocrine disorders such as addisons disease resulting from reduced function of the adrenal glands and the normal change of hormonal balance in pregnancy cause more or less visible more or less localized increase of pigmentation when a cured skin disease leaves a face permanently speckled it sometimes becomes a matter of preference whether the white spots shall be tanned or the brown spots blanched for the lastmentioned purpose specialists have begun using an industrial compound monobensylether of hydroquinone valued as an antioxidant prolonging the life and reducing the color of rubber with time patience and skilled supervision some good results have been obtained as for causes a series of inheritable disorders are associated with lack of pigment widely known among them is albinism its generalized form is marked by milkwhite skin and whitishyellow or white hair lifelong and painful sensitivity to light and decreased visual acuity resuit from lacking eye pigments when exposed to sunshine over long periods albinos get the sunproduced skin cancers which are extremely rare in pigmented people generalized albinism is caused by a mutant gene a changed piece of dna deoxyribonucleic acid that occurs in both chromosomes of a specific pair another mutant gene causes localized albinism when present in one chromosome only dominant inheritance as distinct from the recessive inheritance of generalized albinism localized forms show as piebaldness or white spotting and white forelock terms used to describe irregular or symmetrical narrow or wide spots of white skin in the face or limited to trunk arms and legs in some instances a circumscribed depigmentation takes only a tuft of hair a third gene situated in the x chromosome deprives the retina of pigment in men carrying this mutant gene half the number of their daughters will carry the gene being themselves normal but for dotting and stippling of the eye fundus with pigment all human beings possess pigment cells called melanocytes distributed in the membranes of the brain in the eyes in the skin and mucous membranes and in the hair bulbs albinos are no exceptions but their melanocytes have lost their ability to produce pigment because they lack the enzyme tyrosinase the enzyme defect is not complete even in the generalized form of albinism it is limited to the white spots in partial albinism this partial or localized albinism can be more or less simulated by vitiligo or white spots with a mostly irregular distribution on trunk face and extremities though vitiligo often enough runs in families the mode of inheritance is obscured by similar conditions caused by environmental influences in another sense heredity may be at work when a cell and its descendants loose their enzyme production the forerunner of the melanocyte takes its origin in the primitive nervous system of the embryo from there nonpigmented cells migrate to the skin as observed with the electron microscope they contain minute grains loaded with the forerunner of the active enzyme these grains then mature to enveloped particles containing tyrosinase which converts the amino acid tyrosine to melanine the pigment of sun tanning and of ordinary hue in pigmented people normally all melanoblasts of an embryo carry the same genetic information if one of them undergoes mutation its descendant cells will carry the changed information and may give rise to pigmentpoor spots so much for abnormalities now to normal skin color and its fascinating quality of being divers it has become possible to study skin color objectively by use of the reflectance spectrophotometer an instrument that measures the percentage of light reflected from the skin at different wavelengths thus the degree of pigmentation is told in figures or in the form of a reflectance curve a skin of european type reflects per cent of the light if this has a wavelength of millimicrons and per cent at millimicrons for west africans the reflectance values at these two wavelengths are and these figures come from a recent work by harrison and owen in oxford england they studied the children and grandchildren of west africans with europeans and also the original population groups three or four chromosomes seemed to carry the chemical signals necessary to establish the observed pigmentary differences between west africans and europeans for our purpose this refined study mainly confirms the net results of earlier investigations the conclusions we can draw from these observations are two first pigmentation differences of the afroeuropean grade are inherited in a somewhat more complicated way than albinism and piebaldness the second conclusion leaves us perhaps chromosome pairsof the not directly concerned with sexfree from perceptible engagement in pigment manufacture further we must not think that the three or four chromosome pairs that carry dna information for pigmentation carry nothing else for all we know each of them has safely hundreds and very likely thousands of bits of dna information regulating other characters because we do not know for certain that the essential primary information for pigmentation is limited to just three or four gene pairs which may well be the case some caution is necessary in drawing the conclusion but for all we know and can reasonably assume a very small proportion of the genetic material takes care of color then color is unimportant to the forces of survival that make us keep or loose genetic material possibly but we cannot draw that conclusion from the relative scarcity of genes for normal skin pigmentation blood pigment hemoglobin takes little primary genetic information we cannot do without it color as so many other traits takes its directives from a limited number of molecules with many jobs to do and much information to store but the sum of these other bits of genetic information which regulate our body build and our life processes overshadows pigment genes in general importance turning now to groups of people we know that the genes for the common blood groups a b and o can be differently distributed we do not expect the place where a man worships to influence his genes but we are not overly astonished to hear that as a group muslims in southeastern india carry the b gene in per cent while their hindu neighbors have this gene in per cent religion has kept the muslims together as a group for a very long time they have founded families with their neighbors too rarely to mingle with them into one population with a common gene pool in precisely the same way a group of heavily pigmented group in kongo will because each constitutes a group of people mostly marrying within this group conserve its own proportions of genes for blood groups and other universal traits thus pigment like religion can affect the genetic endowment of a group indirectly by isolation this isolation is relative only let us also remember that it makes no difference if a person gets his a blood group gene from his african or from his european parent in either case it fits the corresponding bit of dna he gets from his other parent with the matching chromosome this other bit may determine blood group a b or o though the fact of common blood groups seems trivial at least to blood doners it serves to remind us of our common ancestry we differ a little but not much in genetic setup from our forebearsthe early toolmakers and now to a nice piece of logic that some of us recognize as an evergreen we are civilized our manlike forebears were primitive they were darkhued therefore people who are still heavily pigmented are more primitive than lightly pigmented people isnt that logic yes it is logic of a sort scotsmen are stingy so is joe smith therefore joe smith is a scotsman thats the same sort of logic and it is false our early forebears were very likely pigmented if we go back far enough we meet other traits that are kept in some ethnic groups and have been lost in others when evolution became a fertilizer of scientific thought a hundred years ago it established a ladder of life higher forms evolved from lower and highest of all rose man the conclusion that all men share the same humble origin and all belong to the same advanced species which is true was not enough for some deep thinkers they went a few steps further and discovered a ladder of lower and higher races being men of wealth and comfort they also found that the wealthy and comfortably established were the fittest though these pseudoscientific ideas met some notable setbacks when applied to human affairs they have for three generations permeated the notions of wielders of power with their foggy plausibility while superior and inferior carry no real meaning in our context it could be worth while asking if pigmentation or a notable lack of skin pigmentation could be favorable in a specific surrounding in other words what adaptive advantage is connected with pigment on the surface the question seems easy enough we either are or become pigmented when exposed to strong sunlight pigment absorbs light and thus the deeper layers of the skin are protected from inflammation and blistering in central africa in australia and southern india people are heavily pigmented and thus protected against the sun the advantage of being pigmented would show in an increased chance of having a normalsized family when living in these regions this seems to make sense even if it tells far less than the whole story if we turn the question and ask for the relative advantage of europeantype pigmentation we could accept the idea of a pigmentpoor skin letting through more ultraviolet light to its deeper layers thereby facilitating the production of vitamin d when sunlight is sparse so various grades of pigmentation could have advantages in different geographic regions and during tens of thousands of years humanity would become dispersed over the earth according to sunlight and color this does not explain the emergence of pigmentpoor people from heavily pigmented ancestral tribes we shall take a look at this problem before returning to the so far sketchy discussion of geographic distribution of skin pigmentation one thing we know about the genes that form us and regulate our life processes is that soonor or later they change one type of such changes or mutations was exemplified by the gene for generalized albinism one fourth of the children of this mutant gene become albinos when albinos marry one another a rare event all their children are albinos were it not for the decreased chance of survival of albinos under all known natural conditions extremely pigmentpoor groups of people could arise in this way when african and european populations are concerned each of a few genes contributes in a way not yet known in details a minor amount of pigment let us assume that long ago somewhere in africa one of these genes changed to produce a just discernible lighter nuance a carrier of this new gene would leave it to half his children if their just perceptibly lighterhued children in turn founded families one fourth of their offspring would be still poorer in pigment to these carriers of one mutant gene in duplicate very strong sunlight might have been hurtful if they sought the shadow of the rain forest they might have come upon abundant food resources helping their kind to survive and multiply but at least two other genes had to change in order to produce a really light skin if one or two genes of a hundred thousand mutates it could take thousands of years before small flocks and scattered tribes produced these additional mutations in effective quantities once relatively lighthued men and women with different mutant genes for pigment loss met and founded families still lighter offspring would result and a white tribe could finally emerge this is how a group of pigmentpoor human beings could be formed over a long period of time through forces we are well acquainted with but how could such groups survive grow in number and spread over wide geographical regions in view of the intense popular interest in pigment we know remarkably little about the advantage and disadvantage of color gradations in the need for protection against strong sunlight would seem to fit the distribution of very lightly pigmented people in northern europe perceptibly darker but still lightly pigmented people in southern europe and northern africa and heavily pigmented people in equatorial africa but what about the americas on both subcontinents the original inhabitants are pigmented but relatively lightly so and without any decided tendency for equatorial tribes to be more heavily pigmented the northern regions of america and asia are inhabited by pigmented people we have to question even the simple and plausible exploration of pigment variation as adaptive to sunlight true enough everything can be explained the arctic sunglare gives the darkeyed hunter an advantage without his rich eye pigmentation his sight would be blurred and he could not easily detect his quarry if sun does not suffice to account for the heavy pigmentation in africa another explanation comes handy the deep shadows of the tropical rain forest would allow the dark hunter to come close to his prey while a milkwhite apparition would attract a ghastly interest from the leopard this seems reasonable but then we ask why the pygmy tribes babinga ako mawambi and other forest dwellers are in fact yellowishbrown not black in africa we meet the darkest people on the savannas where pigment no doubt protects against the scathing sunlight again the bushmen living in the kalahari desert are not much darker than many southeuropeans without denying the adaptive value of pigmentation we keep asking if relative advantages such as those mentioned could thousands of years ago have sufficed to split mankind into differently colored tribes and peoples we could add to the list of disadvantages of being too lightly pigmented under the tropical sun the sunprovoked skin cancer of the elderly though by far not preventing white people from settling in tropical regions could cause some disadvantage to the flock we have evidence that humanlike forerunners of our species kept some elderly members of their families presumably for some useful purpose a disease shortening the lives of the elderly more often in white than in pigmented flocks could increase the risk of succumbing to catastrophs where the experience of old people could have opened a trail to survival this is possible but as evidence such speculations look rather thin from the study of blood pigments in african populations we know that one and the same gene can cause both advantages and disadvantages balancing each other such forces keep a population heterogenous a minor additional advantage for a mutant gene will in a limited number of generations virtually eliminate its originally normal partner gene allele we cannot deny the possibility that shades of pigmentation have in different environments long ago caused distinct advantages we also have good reason to question the largescale effect of such advantages all the time we must take into account the additional facts of clothing and protective paint before the human race went manlike toolmakers used scrapestones and mussel shells to prepare hides for clothing we must not assume that our forebears just waited to be bleached or tanned by chance mutations before going where they wanted to go then let us face the fact that we do not know of any clear and decisive disadvantage shutting off a land to people with sparse pigment or advantage opening it to heavily pigmented people pigmentation may never have played a major part in adjustment to any environment another fact remains that of a few billion people roughly assortable in pigmented and white so what other forces than those of natural selection could produce very dark and very lightcolored peoples a major catastrophe such as flood plague or famine could by mere chance leave a handful of black men and women to repopulate one region they would leave no brown descendants under similar circumstances in other regions white survivors could happen to become the founders of a tribe similarly if a desert prevents a lightly colored flock from intercourse with its heavily pigmented neighbors it may grow to a tribe or a people with its own light color such forces of chance very likely have been at play in the past they are still at work through skeletal remains and implements found in the earth we know that human flocks were scattered over the earth tens of thousands of years ago the first europeans to leave remnants lived years ago the first north americans years ago thus flocks of a few families have had time to grow large and diverse before we met them in history mother africa had space and warmth enough for all her manycolored children but we may surmise that heavily colored girls preferred men of their own hue when it came to founding a family when migrant flocks met lightcolored young people found each other and the combinations of genes necessary for white hue were secured such mating selection helps establish groups with distinct color or relative lack of color in a limited number of generations it was probably the strongest single force in the emergence of pigmentation differences if in addition slight adaptive advantages long ago helped establish black tan and white in their diverse regions they gave mankind an increased chance to survive should white succumb in the frosty outskirts of the world tan might survive but thanks to human sagacity and mutual assistance all shades of color survived today pigment or lack of pigment has only one adaptive advantage that of group acceptance like it or not mankind is changing its shell like a lobster with the propagation of universal techniques and ideas goes a desire to identify the own group to shelter its traditions and characteristics we know nothing about future groups units in a harmonious global society or flocks of cave dwellers in a world gone to wrack but we have had the color variant and may have matured to new standards for group identification if we are bent to take the idea of changing shell more literally we can contemplate the fact that mankind grows a little richer in pigment every day more than two thirds of the increase in the world population is contributed by pigmented people our view into the past is veiled and our vision of the future is dim but we can feel confident that color never meant and never will mean so much to human kind as we make of it in our own moment of anguish and struggle ours is only a glimpse of the long drama of life if we are to catch a little of its hidden meaning we must try not to be blinded by the trivial and the apparent dr carl a larson author of pigmentation is a graduate of the university school of medicine of lund university in sweden since dr larson has been a member of the staff of the institute of genetics at his alma mater heading the department of genetics dr larson has done research work in the fields of mental retardation and human genetics and lectured before international congresses he tells us that this article grew out of his concern over the discrepancy between the widespread interest in pigmentation and true knowledge about the functions of the pigment cell the december issue of negro digest featured dr larsons article the supreme race in which he concluded that such a label could only be applied to the race of man
the new breed by peter oday within the black ghettoes of america a new genera tion is making its presence felt its presence has farreaching j implications for the survival of the society at large yet has r not been sufficiently described and explained by the many observers and writers of the black communities but perhaps the best way to understand it is not through the works of writers and scholars but through certain changes occurring within the fertile music of the black comunities rythmn and blues gospels and spirituals and to a lesser extent jazz comprise some of the most significant components of black culture in america within their sounds and lyrics are contained all the hurt pain and good times which black people share through their daily experiences there is hardly an area of community life which escapes the contact of this music and the musicians and vocalists through their sounds have come to function as powerful agents of moral and cultural influence on black behavior black music then is an integral thread which knits together invigorates and gives substance to the personal and collective experiences of the black masses however since world war ii and particularly since the midfifties important changes have begun to take place within black music the rhythms have become more varied and complex black artists are getting more and more way out with their sounds the form and expression of black music is taking off in all kinds of directions these changes can be readily seen in jazz with the emergence of such artists as ornette coleman albert ayler archie shepp and sun ra leroi jones writes how one of these artists wants to play past note and get them purely into sound into the basic element the clear emotional thing freed absolutely from antiemotional concept another more important change has been in the direction of a fusion between the blues and the spirituals it is now practically impossible to distinguish between the two the spirituals now contain the big beat and the blues the cries and humming of the spirituals the whole career of the late sam cooke in fact exemplifies this blend starting out with a gospel group the soul stirrers he later branched into rythmn and blues and continued to record and influence music in both areas until his death however the big hit the night time is the right time by ray charles and the raylettes is probably the prime single example of the blend between gospels and the blues produced in it marked the complete popularization of the gospelblues sound in the black community that sound so prevalent today is clearly distinct from the blues of earlier years the clovers the orioles charles brown and particularly the older country blues singers were producing a more secular song some of the older country blues singers in fact have reacted strongly against the more spiritual oriented blues singers of today it is well known how upset big bill broonzy was over ray charles as he said of ray hes got the blues hes crying sanctified hes mixed the blues with the spirituals i know thats wrong the mixture of the spirituals and blues the new expressions in jazz all are indications of deeply rooted ferment within black culture old forms are being discarded or improvised upon new different and freer forms are being created recently there was a side out called the new breed james brown in his hit recording papas got a brand new bag refers to a new breed beneath the pulsating changes in black music one can feel the absorption of new ingredients into black life one can discern the emergence of a new breed of black man making his influence felt over the black ghetto it behooves us then to ask who is this new breed what conditions have gone into his formation what kind of consequences does his presence have for the society at large what in effect is the new breed saying one way to begin to identify the emerging generation is through statistics reliable statistics tell us that one of the fastest growing population components in the united states today is the negro now living in cities who was also born in cities before world war ii most blacks lived in the rural south and most of those who did live in the north had been born in the south they all had direct contact with the south but today we find a completely new phenomenon large rapidly growing black populations who are indigenous to city life these homegrown urban populations while rural and southern in the culture transmitted by parents relatives and friends have had no direct contact with the rural south they are subjected to the rigorous ordeal of the urban way of life from birth and in that sense truly represent the new negro yet the statistics cannot give a complete picture for they omit the cultural social and human experiences which surround the emergence of urban blacks to get into a broader and deeper area of facts one must inquire into the black world itself into the belief and authority structures that have held together the black community in america every nation tribe or natural community is ruled less by external forces from without than by internal forces from within compulsive internal images in the form of beliefs and moralities deeply embedded in the collective experiences which a natural group has shared in common i regulate behavior among the members of the group and achieve thereby a necessary amount of cohesion and cooperation without which the group could not survive it is these internal laws generally called customs folkways and mores which make a person feel most comfortable among his own kind and less so among outsiders the security and reliability which they furnish to ones environment enables the development of his personality every man owes his life his moral and material condition to his family and nation for it is through these groups that he becomes human born helpless and dependent he wins control over himself only through the education and sustenance given him by his people our purpose here is to inquire into some of the vital internal forces that have traditionally structured the black community in america outside of a few exceptional cases it is widely acknowledged that black people from slavery to at least world war ii lived in a severely limited isolated and relatively static world the status of the black man at the bottom of white society was well defined and strongly entrenched the general orientation of his life and of his subjective mind was that which had been shaped by the slavelike conditions of the southern plantation system although after world war i many black people migrated to cities even those in the cities remained by and large a southern people the moral habits and cultural norms internalized in their consciences were essentially the same as those shared by their relatives and friends left remaining in the south the particular belief structures which we want to bring out are those buttressed by two prevailing authorities that of the church and that of the white ruling powers christianity as taught and administered by the folk and storefront preachers has always provided the dominant religious nourishment for the spiritualistic black masses the church its teachings and its activities have been not only the main religious institution but also one of the major social institutions of the black community now this is not to say that all black people went to church and lived by the bible for there has always been a large element of black sinners who have lied stolen and done wrong but the point is that even they did not really escape the church influence under which most of them came up in fact in most cases they probably looked upon themselves as sinners and almost certainly would never have challenged the divine authority of jesus or the bible life had just become too cruel and hard for them to remain in the church or to live according to its teachings they were wrong and knew it but if they ever decided to live right or if there ever was a right way to live it would be by the teachings of the church just as the divine authority of jesus was rarely questioned so was the authority of the white people to rule black people rarely questioned the black masses were so downtrodden so poor illiterate and ignorant and the white mans power over them so omniscient that any thought of their rising to an equal status with the white man could not possibly have been taken serious for long whether it was at home at church at work in the schools in government or in business the authority of the white man hovered over their lives it was always he who held the main strings to their well being in such a situation there was little alternative left for the black man except to acquire a slave mentality to look upon himself as inferior and upon the white man as superior and to accept the white way of doing things as the right way after all such an outlook corresponded to almost everything which he observed and experienced in real life true there were sporadic black rebellions but none of these seriously threatened the dominant position of the white powers in the end they probably only confirmed to most blacks that it would be impossible to break down the white mans domination over them the prevailing authorities of the church and the white man then were two dominant pillars of the traditional black world the beliefs and moralities which they imprinted upon black behavior severely constricted and stunted the mental and moral development of the black population however between the preworld war ii period and now many things have come to pass the depression two major wars erratic but large scale occurrences of industrialization and urbanization economic and employment stagnation etc it would be impossible to measure the influence which all these complex societal forces had upon the black community but one result is obvious namely that most black people have acquired a different basis for the existence of their community life this basis the slums of large american cities was to prove quite different from the type of life which black people knew previously in the agricultural south in the industrial cities the black people would have to adjust to more complex but still oppressive conditions of life the most farreaching consequence of this adjustment has been the breakdown in the traditional authority and belief structures of the black ghetto today the church and ruling white authorities no longer hold the grip they once held on the minds of the black population the christianity preached under the slave conditions of the south simply can not have any relevance or real meaning to the black youth coming up under the complex industrial systems of the cities young people today often know more about the world around them than do the preachers the religious teachings of the black preachers have now become no more than a means of deluding the ignorant black masses so that the preachers themselves can become rich new college trained sociologist preachers are attempting to fill the vacuum left by the increasingly outcast uneducated preachers but their formal style and presentation has no real attraction to black tastes thus the influence of the black church has steadily decreased as black preachers have failed to keep up with the time and demands of the younger generation another development of equal if not more significance is the rise to prominence of other religious groups particularly the nation of islam although these groups may not have been very successful in recruiting great numbers of negroes into their fold they have been very effective in disseminating their special ideas this means that they have questioned and repudiated some of the basic tenets of black christianity arguments against the divinity of jesus and the bible and the justice of the christian god which previously would have been taboo are now circulating freely within the black community and the result is easy to see a typical black youth today does not believe that he was bom into a world of sin that jesus died years ago for his salvation and that if he lives right now he will go to heaven when he dies if anything instead of believing that he owes god something he believes that god owes him something young people want to enjoy life now and are not prepared to suffer and endure as their parents did unaccustomed and unable to meet these requirements of the young generation the spiritual authority of the black church like the influence of its preachers has diminished the other belief structure to fall has been that of the authority of white domination as james baldwin has put it the american negro can no longer nor will he ever be controlled by white americas image of him the mental subjection the nigger stigma which the white power structure had imposed upon the black man is now a thing of the past a new pride in being black is growing lightskinned negroes who might formerly have tried to pass for white are now glad to be black negroes no longer conceive of the world as one in which the white man has to be on the top and the black man on the bottom for today there are black nations in africa and a powerful yellow nation in asia moreover militantly charismatic and popular leaders such as malcolm_x have revealed to the masses the responsibility of the white power structure for their downtrodden condition the white mans treachery hypocrisy and deceit in his exploitation of the black man has been brought into the open and his significance in a world populated by the darker races has been belittled thus the determination of the us government and military to win the war against the yellow people in vietnam tends to confirm the now prevalent opinion in the black community that the white man will do almost anything to maintain his domination over the darker races the black world has changed so dramatically since before world war ii that it would be impossible for a youth coming up today to have the same view of the world and himself which his father had in the turbulent lawless cities of america the rhythm of life is quicker and more varied and complex for the masses life becomes a game in which one has to learn at an early age to be flexible to scheme and hustle if he is to survive use or be used stay one up on people or theyll take advantage of you besides this necessity of scheming in order to make it one also becomes exposed and attracted to a wide variety of social sets storefront churches hustling on the streets with pimps and prostitutes black college crowds integrated civilrighters and beatniks the fingerpopping and good times groups black nationalists when one moves between any of these sets he has to go through changes he has to change roles to change his game so that he can get in on a particular set from hustle to hustle from set to set such is the pace of black life in the cities the chaos and disorder which is a part of it makes it easy to understand why some of the new jazz sounds are becoming chaotic for after all in these sounds the musicians are often expressing no more than the various personal experiences which they have known in the disorder of american living conditions it is also easy to understand how the spirituals become mixed up with the blues the black singers coming up through the church take their singing but not the religion serious eventually the forces of black life on the streets pull them into the world of secular music and they carry their church sound and feeling and sometimes even the church moralities into the blues the tense fast driving demands of the rat race in modern america is pushing negroes to do things which their fathers never would have thought of doing and this is changing their music and their whole way of life on the streets the young headshakers used to just talk aloud drink wine and steal from and fight among each other today besides drinking wine they are getting loaded on weed and other things instead of fighting among one another they are stabbing white people on the subways it is clear that the black nation today is in a state of profound flux the collective conscience of the people is being shaken to the very core of its being thereby causing black music and black culture to take off into so many different directions the pathos violence and disorder involved in this period of severe cultural and social disruption are often shocking to older generation negroes one oldtimer arna bontemps who had pleasant and memorable experiences in harlem during the negro renaissance of the twenties was shocked and frightened by the conditions he found on harlem streets in as he puts it at least one reason for avoiding harlem night streets in would have been the fear of muggers where poets went about singing in the days of the new awakening angry frustrated boys now prowled where primitive children had danced on the sidewalks hungry evileyed little criminals lurked in doorways outlandish cults were meeting in some of the housefront churches where the moaning and shouting had formerly been spontaneous and filled with joy what in gods name had happened actually those conditions bontemps was observing in were only the emerging conditions which produced the young generation of today the fright and shock is largely in his own mind because he is looking at a younger generation through the lens of the older generation the lawlessness which he observes is by and large no more than the breakdown of the cultural folkways and norms which he had known during his time although those norms may have provided some emotional and psychological security to his generation they cannot do so for the present generation because they do not apply to the social realities of today new folkways new mores are being developed but before they become structured the old ones must be vomited up this means a process of shock disruption and transformation it can be a violent and frightening process but it is not as destructive as bontemps puts it for there is a deeper more creative and constructive aspect to it for example one can note that with the destruction and breakdown of law that have occurred during the riots in black communities a deep sense of unity and brotherhood always asserts itself afterwards people who have been in a black community in the aftermath of rioting have witnessed how the residents become more polite to each other on the streets how they are not so quick to lose their temper with one another there is a steady growth in their sense of community and a profound realization that they are sharing a common cause and a common destiny the era of the new breed then is one of order in disorder clarity in confusion unity in disunity the forces of violence and destruction become superceded by those of liberation and brotherhood some have pointed out how negroes in throwing off the shackles of their slave mentality are responding to deep psychological needs for human dignity and selfrespect there is undoubtedly some truth to this but more should be added the changing attitudes among the younger generation are more than a psychological quest for human dignity they express also a greater will to power although many young blacks have come up in some of the worst kind of squalor and poverty in the country most of them still have not had to work as hard as their parents to make a living the young people today not only do not know what it is to labor all day in the fields under the hot sun they have no intention of doing so they are not willing to slave all day like their parents for only a few coins when they see white people all around them with easy jobs and a lot of money for these young people know how wealth success and prestige are really earned in white society the white man with whom they have had experiences is not the one who is openly evil but the one who is doublefaced who will smile in your face while he sticks a knife in your back in moving among the many social sets of the cities these ghetto blacks have come to find out that behind the rigid staid smile of the white woman is often no more than an insecure aggressive and sexually deprived girl that behind the overfriendly air of the white man is frequently a neurotic powerdriven adult with a childlike mentality negroes today know well the type of lives which white people really live and what they do behind the doors that is why unlike their parents they are not impressed by the examples set by white people their actual experiences have taught them that there is nothing genuine behind the examples and ideals of white society when a person has been turned out when he has experienced life as it really exists he just can not appreciate the artificial copy he reacts against phony sets and phony people this is the environmental situation of the new breed with his experiences under oppression and into the deeper and more subjective realms of life with his knowledge of the white world around him it becomes almost impossible for him to be moral in any conventional sense to have someone tell him to go to college so that he can get a good job to be patient and grateful until some charity organization gives him something is an insult if he wants something he will take it in whatever way he can and by any means necessary this is his will to power which goes beyond conventional morality the power attitude among the young breed is what makes them so violenceprone when the sun is hot when there is no place to go and nothing to do because you dont have the means it only takes a small incident of police brutality to set things off mass rioting and looting becomes an easy way to give vent to your pentup anger and frustrations and to get the things you want and need it is this threat of violence among the young breed which makes them a highly political group they are political not because they may like to go on demonstrations or engage in organized political activities but because certain of their actions have farreaching political consequences their willingness to use force and violence to get what they want upsets the traditional socioeconomic organization of american cities the white business and political leaders of the cities cannot stand for widespread looting and rioting because it means destruction of their properties and disturbing their political and social positions this they fear much more than they do peaceful demonstrations and thus become willing to make token concessions to the black community since the white power structure through its black spokesmen has lost its ability to control the black masses and keep them peaceful it has now recognized a necessity to do something quick good housing schools and jobsthese are the concrete essentials which the negro needs hence a host of shotgun crash programs the war on poverty neighborhood youth corps apprenticeship training programs neighborhood improvement centers etc yet it is becoming apparent that even these programs can not cope with the situation at hand one basic reason is that the private economy cant create enough jobs and decent houses for everyone but another more subtle reason has to do with the utilitarian nature of the solutions it is typical of white americans to reduce everything to matters of economic needs and basic commodities and to neglect thereby the related human factors after all when one deals with houses and jobs one inevitably must confront the people who are going to live in the houses and occupy the jobs so today when one talks about housing and jobs for negroes he sooner or later will have to face up to black people themselves which means facing up to attitudes of the younger generation and it is here at the attitudes and emotions of young blacks that the shotgun poverty programs are likely to fail for their wants are not easily satisfied if you offer a young black a job he might take it then again he might not he might not feel like working at the time he is too cool too resentful and too reckless to be easily satisfied he takes things in his own stride and is not prepared to shape up to the hasty and illprepared demands of the white man the attitudes dispositions and sounds of the new breed are with us no one can escape their influence the penetrating glares the pulsating rhythms the downtoearth heatthose elements which have always been a part of music and culturehave been reinvigorated and given a new distinct overall quality it is a quality which cannot be sufficiently described in words but whose end effect is unmistakably clear the end effect is one of completely unmasking the listener of piercing beneath artificial forms to the raw emotions and bare essentials the effect of new breed music is part and parcel of the total social situation created by the new breeders influence with the development of his style of life his actions and will to power everybodys front is broken and there is nowhere to hide the white ruling interest can no longer hide behind their promises and declarations of freedom democracy and racial equality no one believes their declarations any more now they stand fully exposed resting on nothing but naked power that power which was experienced so brutally by the black residents of watts and which operates so blatantly in vietnam and santo domingo the black socalled leadersthe preachers lawyers and entertainersno longer impress people with statements of what they can do and will do because everybody knows they cant back up what they say amid the masses of black people the field negroes stirred up by the younger generation have shed their slave mentality and stand face to face with their real plight in the country in the background one can hear the voices the shouts and cries of the new breed what is the new breed saying they are saying what the bible prophesied long ago we shall reap what our fathers have sown we are the last who shall be first the new breed has expressed a willingness to act they are hostile and restless ripe for militant black leadership can such leadership emerge this is the central question which the new breed poses to the black ghetto in america today the truth about negro crime by frank poague jr the past few months as in the past years we have v m been subjected to the alarming news of the negro crime i i rate in america headlines in local and national newspapers and magazines reports on radio and television have reminded awakened americans of this picture alabama to try protesters pickets arrested protesters arrested negroes arrested at greensboro arrests end threeday protest in alabama town killed in los angeles riot arrested these are just a few examples no intelligent person white or black can deny the fact that crime is more prevalent among negro americans in fact some white supremacists maintain that the negro is innately more prone to criminal acts according to a recent fbi report the states with the highest crime rates per inhabitants were nevada california and arizona vermont was lowest with five new yorks rate was arrest statistics for per cent of the population showed negroes arrested for murder and whites negroes arrested for negligent homicide and whites negroes arrested for forcible rape and whites negroes arrested for robbery and whites negroes arrested for aggravated assault and whites negroes arrested for burglary and whites negroes arrested for larceny and whites and negroes arrested for auto theft and whites these figures are alarming though only per cent of the u s population is negro more than half per centof persons arrested for violent offenses murders robberies and aggravated assaults are negroes even while data on criminal law causality was being painstakingly assembled the current public dialogue over u s crime returned again to two harsh facts that spring out of the statistics the high rate of negro crime and the high rate of juvenile crime we have learned to accept the latter as a form of societal disorganization but the negro crime picture is too much to accept without severe criticisms in a real sense said a former high ranking administration official to speak of crime today is to speak of negro crime yet the evidence of negro crime today does no more than reaffirm a truism of law enforcement that crime however universal its incidence is peculiarly nurtured by ghettos that will in most instances grow into slums i might point out here that extra care must be taken in interpreting criminal statistics in regard to race note for instance census and criminal statistics are based on the popular conception of race rather than on an anthropological differentiation crime of negroes against whites are treated with more concern by local officials than crime of negroes against negroes comparison of white and negro crime rate fail to take into account the differences between the population the higher prison commitment rates of negroes reflect in part the inferior community facilities and specialized institutions for those negroes who personify problems not usually included with the scope of crime and fbi statistics are weighted heavily by urban crime patterns of the north and west exaggerating incidence of negro crime to a degree one must not overlook those social conditions which make for the high crime rate among negro americans especially when crime is defined in terms of the application of the law we cant for instance overlook the fact that crimes committed by negroes are more frequently prosecuted than those committed by whites or that negroes are less well able to defend themselves legally they are less often in position to secure a good lawyer and they are more promptly sentenced to prison gunnar myrdal in his controversial american dilemma recognized long ago that at all times the stereotyped notion has prevailed that negroes have a criminal tendency which manifests itself in acts ranging all the way from petty thievery by household servants to razorslashing homicide statistics can be misleading roy wilkins executive secretary of the national association for the advancement of colored people recognized this when he said the records show the negro is more easily arrested than white persons dragnet arrests for a crime admitted by one or two persons frequently haul a dozen negroes to the jail and into the record books too often measurement of crime must be limited to those apprehendedundoubtedly not a representative sample of all criminals even the counting of apprehended criminals is crude and approximate at best because of the lack of uniformity in laws and in crimereporting over the united states furthermore any index of negro crime runs the risk of being inflated by discriminatory practices of the police the courts and penal systems to begin with the laws themselves may be discriminatory segregated legislation makes many acts a crime for negroes but not for whites for those reasons the indices which have to be used are best thought of as measures of apparent crime not crime per se according to a fbi report in negroes were arrested twoandahalf to three times more frequently than other americans proportionate to their percentage of the population for crimes like murder and nonnegligent manslaughter aggravated assault and gambling negro arrest rates were roughly five to seven times those of whites in many instances the police frequently pick up numerous suspects in connection with a single crime this is especially true in communities where negroes lack political influence in fact the negro is more exposed to the misuse of police power than any other group the police custom of arresting negroes on slight suspicion or of staging mass roundups of negroes is definitely related to the negros lack of security and his inability to exert political pressure against such abuses the feeling is widespread among criminologists race relations experts negro leaders and others that the negro crime rate is exaggerated because of discriminatory arrest practices on the part of law enforcement agencies they agree that negroes are more liable both to be suspected ofand to be arrested forcertain crimes than are whites dragnet arrests and illegal arrests are more likely to occur when negroes rather than whites are involved they agree further that after arrest negroes are less likely to secure bail and are more liable to be counted in jail statistics they are more liable than whites to be indicted and less likely to have their cases dismissed if tried negroes are more likely to be convicted if convicted they are more likely to be included in the count of prisoners negroes are also more liable than whites to be kept in prison for the full terms of their commitments and correspondingly less likely to be paroled perhaps with more impartial treatment by all lawenforcement units negro crime might be considerably reduced but differential treatment by the police and courts is not the whole story by any means involved in these perplexities must be thrown education discrimination by a large segment of the dominant white group family disorganization induced by the competitive struggle to survive in a society with few equal opportunities lack of community organization employment practices and despair in attempting to accommodate to urban life the question should be why will crime continue to be more prevalent among negro americans a simple answer to this question could be that negro crime will remain more prevalent as long as there is prejudice and discrimination and no solutions to the problems the negro faces as a predominantly lowerclass citizen negroes when compared with other americans are more often lower class and poor slum residents of the largest cities victims of family disorganization southern in origin young and unemployed and objects of extensive discriminationeach an important social correlate of crime apart from race family disorganization family disorganization is characteristic of the negro family in fact thomas pettigrew in his recent book the profile of the negro american holds that there may be a direct personality relationship between violent crime and the absence of the father in any event there seems to be little question that broken families regardless of race are one of the agents of crime in general an example of the extent of family disorganization among negro families in the south may be seen in the following table selfimprovement w begins at home by preston dewitt wiley sr all me an uncle tom if it makes you feel better i happen to believe that nothing in the glittering history of the negro revolution has failed so dismally as the zeitgeists failure in coming to grips with negro family deterioration the gap between the aims of the civil_rights movement and the welfare of the people is greater than ever if i were obliged to make a list of the most urgent problems facing the people of the united states in the field of social accommodation i would rank the disorganization of negro family life at the head of the list so much for perspective i have long preached albeit unsuccessfully that where there is no vision the people perish apparently current negro leadership cannot break the mode of its own doctrine to examine critically the generationsold habits of the northern negro and seek selfimprovement would be for them a return to the discredited uncle tom preachments of booker t washington it must be said sadly enough that the negro community has not always shown great enthusiasm for selfimprovement shrill cries by negro militants continue to drown out attempts by more responsible negro citizens to make a hardheaded appraisal of this most agonizing of americas social problems as a result the country is farther than ever from defining the boundaries of the problem one finds that today far too many negroes are bemused with the quaint view that somebody perhaps the federal government should do somethingshould seize the initiative and do it well and thoroughly that may be but by my lights the place to start is at the other end of townwithin the negro community let us be honest we negroes are not providing the answers and if we are not providing them because we do not have them then we need to ask whether we are doing enough to get them there is no question in my mind that beneath the surface there is disenchantment by many thousands of thoughtful negro americans who now sense the need to switch the civil_rights dialogue from the easily understandable aim of dismantling jim crow in the south to the comparably more difficult matter of the northern ghetto in this connection negro demagoguery notwithstanding it is plainly clear that negro riots in watts washington or new york acceleration of illegitimate birth emasculation of the negro male dominance of the negro female and the breakdown of negro family life which we have been talking about are all unarguable realities negro leadership can perform an enormous service if it will act on the premise that negroes want to be both negroes and americans maintaining their racial integrity while associating on the freest terms with all american citizens participating in american culture in its broadest sense and contributing to it in fullest freedom in addressing the question of how to equip negroes to deal effectively with the changed aspect of the zeitgeist it would appear that a stress on self help and racial solidarity emphasis on economic development and criticism of thinly disguised negro racism together with a continued strong plea for political and social freedom should manifest itself in constructive form meanwhile the process of education must go on while i have been accused since my piece conscience of a black conservative appeared in the january issue of negro digest of being more critical of negro progress than the facts justify my conviction is that negroes are not anxious generally to provide initiative for social construction within the negro community my further view which is part of a larger complex of ideas is based upon the conviction that the acquisition of wealth and moralityattained largely by our own effortswill determine the future destiny of negroes in this great country of ours the conviction i spoke of a moment ago becomes manifest in my use of the word conservative what i mean here is that there are overwhelming values american values if you willthat are being threatened by the excesses of the negro revolution the issues at stake are fundamental questions of moral and political philosophy being raised in american political culture to put the matter in perspective floyd mckessick of the congress of racial equality core recently insisted at a top administration conference on civil_rights that to alleviate the american negros plight the capitalistic system must be abolished whatever the pathology of the attraction one would like to see critical judgment brought to bear on this sort of thing surely it is the responsibility of negro leadership to assess the longrange consequences of its policies of denunciation would douglass or booker t washington really approve a politics of every snout at the public troughand longterm good sacrificed to the demands of the moment given a choice one suspects a majority of negroes will accommodate themselves to a growing emphasis on selfhelp as for the deterioration of the negro family the verdict is clear neither we nor any other people will ever be respected until we respect ourselves and we will never respect ourselves until we develop the inner strengths to live respectably this part of our destiny is in our own hands the laws which determine the destinies of individuals and nations are impartial and eternal we must deserve to be great break bias and poverty by elinor richey t sounds like an experiment primarily of interest to financiers actually the ones whose fates are riding on it are jobless negroes standing on street corners throughout the country the experiment is the u s economic development administrations new industry revitalization pilot project in oakland california early this year eda announced that because of dwindling industry and persistent high unemployment oakland had been designated a distressed area as minedout appalachia was designated two years ago to get industry humming again and the jobless working massive doses of capital would be injected into oaklands economy in the form of grants and lowcost loans for public works for new and expanding enterprises both the city government and private industry scrambled to apply for upwards of million to finance such public works as airport hangars and marine docks and industries ranging from an automotive assembly plant to a meteorological equipment concern a string is attached to these funds priority for jobs generated by edabacked enterprises and such jobs are expected to run into thousands must be given the longterm unemployed aid recipients must so pledge but what is significant is that the large majority of the jobless are negroes oaklands overall unemployment rate of per cent is more than twice the national rate of per cent but what shoots it up so high is that among the per cent of the population who are negroes between to per cent are idle since the federal government has resolved to enforce the pledges and with thousands of jobs of the goodpaying kind expected to result it appears large numbers of oakland negroes will be ushered from poverty to pocketjingling plenty moreover federal spokesmen say that if the remedy works on oakland other cities with high jobless rates which nearly means extrahigh joblessness among negroeswill receive the eda cure oakland presents a strong test case like many other negroes who moved to industrial centers seeking better times only to meet road blocks from unions and personnel departments oakland negroes have never really been admitted to the urban economy although negroes comprise more than a third of the citys population they hold but per cent of the local apprenticeship jobs per cent of the police force jobs and per cent of the nonteaching jobs with the school district janitoring laboring and kitchen jobs excepted these statistics typify their position in the decentpaying job market and gauge the strength of the color barrier that eda has tackled recruitments for world war ii shipyard workers built oaklands negro community when the shipyards closed negroes were denied a place in the peacetime industrial boom yet negroes continued to arrive part of the national trek to california they were obliged to compete for the already dwindling supply of domestic and laboring jobs and there wasnt nearly enough work to go around throughout the forties and fifties oaklands economy appeared to be in rosy health while industries frequently departed oakland new westwardmigrating subsidiaries replaced them new employers followed the discrimination pattern filling their personnel needs by hiring in the suburbs and out of state after all oaklands civil service on the excuse of a dearth of qualified applicants did the same oakland appeared to be getting away with ignoring its negro citizens of course by preventing them from supporting themselves by default it elected to keep them on welfare although oakland is californias fourth city in size its welfare load soon was tracking los angeles faring little better were oaklands other minorities minorities make up roughly half of the city especially the mexicanamericans and relocated indians beneath the surface oakland was sick and by the sixties was showing it industry departures had increased and newcomers were bypassing oakland with the same complaint as the departees expensive labor and skills shortages together with high taxes and land prices of course the former came of deliberately keeping union help in short supply by barring minorities while high taxes resulted from keeping citizens too poor to pay taxes thus shifting the burden onto industry moreover business was fleeing shopping streets were becoming gloomy strands of closed and for sale signs domestic servants and welfare recipients arent big spenders and the citys commuting labor force cashed their paychecks in suburbia and spent them there a market survey showed per cent of oaklands families had less than a year in purchasing power shortsighted as always the city government saw only symptoms instead of recognizing its mistake in forcing citizens into dependency instead of making them productive consumers city fathers imagined all that was needed was to woo back the high spenders and big taxpayers it spruced up the city with new public buildings and modern street lights while angling for new industry via a nationwide advertising campaign none of this worked and now the federal government has in effect declared an emergency while oaklands malady has been diagnosed correctly this time it doesnt mean a cure will be easy nobody expects oakland to passively surrender its prejudices moreover not only has unemployment multiplied numerically over the past two decades but jobs have grown more demanding if the government is to require that employers hire the jobless there must be qualified applicants waiting on the bench to qualify for the jobs many of the jobless will need training to provide it the government has set up a million skills center which like those already operating in detroit and chicago will combine reading and writing with vocational training courses will range from six months to two years with enrollees receiving living allowances of from to while they train but many jobs also require a union card oakland labor unions have maintained the fiction that they dont discriminate its just that some cant pass their apprenticeship tests negroes and mexicanamericans have charged that union screening is designed to shut them out not the least of the skills centers functions will be to prepare applicants to pass apprenticeship screening eda men have been holding conferences with oakland labor officials asking their cooperation in the skills center and jobcreating project but while inviting volunteer compliance federal spokesmen have warned that if a hiring agent whether an employer or a labor official seeks to violate or circumvent the requirement that edagenerated jobs go to the jobless effective persuasion will be brought to bear eda agents are readying an arsenal of effective persuaders among them is the new equal employment opportunities commission which has the responsibility of enforcing the provisions of the civil_rights act that bars racial discrimination in jobs the commission headed by franklin d roosevelt jr is empowered to obtain court injunctions ordering employers or unions to desist from discriminatory practices should an edabacked work project fail to hire a qualified minority person the commission can file an injunction against the employer or if a union were the hiring agent the union would be the injunction target the commission might also act against a union which unjustly turned down a skills center graduate for an apprenticeship program roosevelt visited oakland in march to instruct minority leaders and others how to file complaints with his agency which may act only when a specific complaint has been made the department of labor is in a position to crack down with economic sanctions it can cancel federal contracts with firms that practice job discrimination but eda is exploring other ways of enforcing the job pledges not the least of which is synchronizing the flow of subsidy with an employers cooperation with edas goals assisting eda in plotting strategy for employing the enforcement arsenal is dr floyd hunter the eminent negro sociologist and author his crack berkeleybased research firm has been tapped by eda to conduct planning research and evaluation for the oakland job creating project dr hunter who has called oaklands city government a coordinating effort for the business community and who once conducted a housing discrimination study for the city that was so accusatory of his employers that they suppressed it will keep an eagle eye on edabacked enterprises to make sure their hiring practices measure up as added insurance oakland civil_rights organizations are planning persuaders of their own leaders such as naacp president clinton white and mark comfort of the oakland direct action committee plan to maintain a continuing watch over hiring if an employer violates his pledge he may find his operation paralyzed by a mass demonstration far from being unique the plight of oaklands negroes is merely part of a general dismal western situation a report on negro workers in western states recently issued by the bureau of labor statistics showed only seven in had professional technical or managerial jobs as contrasted to the white rate of per more than per cent of western negro workers have lowpaying unskilled or semiskilled jobs compared with per cent of the white workers demonstrating that it is nearly as easy for a negro to become a doctor as to enter a union were statistics showing the entire west had negro plumbers and negro doctors no doubt the watts riots goaded this long overdue federal crackdown on job discrimination but it was also spurred by reports of two of president johnsons advisory groups his commission on automation warned that the present ratio of two jobless negroes to one jobless white will rise to five to one by if negroes continue to hold the same proportion of jobs in each general occupational category as they do now and the presidents council of economic advisers have computed the cost to the nation of racial discrimination in employment their figures say that if negroes were assimilated into the work force labor productivity would rise billion oaklands error is the nations error in microcosm in the work of negro writers by horace r cayton are all imprisoned within our culture it is almost impossible to break through the customary ways of perceiving the world about us in order that we may question in a fundamental sense the values held by society sometimes a new critical perspective of society and its culture is stimulated by powerful ideological developments which throw new light on the everyday world of events a new perspective can lead to insight and change these revelations come to philosophers scientists political leaders and above all to the artist and of all the artists it has been the writer who from the beginning of time has fashioned various brave new worlds the creative process of the writer is difficult to describe and understand it may be said that all men dream of freedom but it requires the powerful revelation and perception of the artist to capture these dreams and put them into shape we must understand the influences of various ideological forces as they have touched the perceptions and insights of negro writers if we are to understand the prophets and poets of the new negro in contemporary american society among the most crucial and fundamental forces affecting the negro writer have been those of psychoanalysis and the several disciplines of the social sciences i am a sociologist by training and a writer by temperament many sociologists consider me one of them and i usually tell them i am a writer when writers think of me as a writer i tell them im probably more of a sociologist and this leads me into a fundamental concern the question of identity i shall start with an autobiographical statement perhaps because i have recently completed an autobiography i was born in seattle at the turn of the century i discovered at a very early age perhaps three or four that i was a negro and i became aware that i would always be one and that negroes would always be underprivileged and stigmatized a group of people set apart i also knew that i was an american and in school as well as in the home i learned that america had a dream of freedom these two identities both of which i had internalized seemed to be in constant conflict when i became aware of the conflict i was confused allen wheelis in his book the quest for identity writes nowadays the sense of self is deficient the questions of adolescence who am i where am i going what is the meaning of life receive no final answers nor can they be laid aside the uncertainty persists the period of being uncommitted is longer the choices with which it terminates more tentative personal identity does not become fixed does not therefore provide an unchanging vantage point from which to view experience man is still the measure of all things but it is no longer the inner man that measures it is the other man specifically it is the plurality of men the group and what the group provides is shifting patterns what it measures is conformity it does not provide the hard inner core by which the value of patterns and conformity is determined the hard inner core has in our time become diffuse elusive often fluid more than ever before one is aware of the identity he appears to have and more than ever before is dissatisfied with it it doesnt fit it seems alien as though the unique course of ones life had been determined by untoward accident commitments of all kinds social vocational marital moral are made more tentatively longterm goals seem to become progressively less feasible wheelis continues to observe that identity is a coherent sense of self it depends upon the awareness that ones endeavors and ones life make sense that they are meaningful in the context in which life is lived it depends also upon stable values and upon the conviction that ones actions and values are harmoniously related it is a sense of wholeness of integration of knowing what is right and what is wrong and of being able to choose the past half century has encompassed enormous gains in understanding and in mastery but many of the old fixed points of reference have been lost and have not been replaced the insecurity i felt as a childtorn between what i had been taught and what washas now spread to all society while i found to an extent an identity other negroes and the whole american society remain confronted by this question richard wright and ralph ellison were fascinated with what herbert hill describes as that vast senseless social order which destroys its victim and which poses the necessity to remain sane in a society where the individual personality is denied and the world appears devoid of meaning hill goes on to say that essentially the framework for native son one of the important novels in contemporary american literature is to be found in its implicit assumption that the social order is directly responsible for the degradation of the negro that american society produces conditions which distort and destroy individual human beings who are part of an oppressed group the character in the book who functions as wrights spokesman states taken collectively they are not simply twelve million people in reality they constitute a separate nation shunned and stripped and held captive within this nation devoid of political social economic and property rights the loss of identity ultimately leads the individual to a state of alienation both from himself and from the society at large he is then constantly preoccupied with the seeking of the self and this is where his time and energy are spent several negro intellectuals have protested against this thus saunders redding has written the obligations imposed by race upon the average educators and talented negro are vast and become at last onerous i am tired of giving up my creative initiative to these demands before considering the psychological effects of american culture on both the blacks and the whites i shall touch briefly upon the historical aspect of the negro it is unique in terms of world history i subscribe to the school of thought that little very little of african culture was brought to the united states and that that which the negro did retain was isolated and died a rapid death what i am saying is that the socalled american negro subculture is purely a product of the negros experience in america it is the american culture refracted through the prism of years of subordination e franklin frazier in his last book the negro church describes the slow growth of cohesiveness in the negro community the cruelty of the plantation system did not even permit the development of a stable family group it was the negro church that first brought some cohesion to the negro it was many years before negroes as a group could even envision a free world certainly there were slave revolts and insurrections but it was not until the negro as a group began to have revelations similar to the one i experienced upon learning that at port arthur in the japanese a colored race had defeated the russians predominantly a caucasian nation that the negro began to search for his identity for a definition recognition and purpose the only way to analyze the position of the negro in america is to anaylze the culture in its entirety america has failed to develop a meaningful way of life that could make our country great a way of fulfilling the vast areas of our individual personalities that are unused and truncated this is evidenced by the indescribable loneliness that pervades our existence we have embraced and are the victims of a configuration of shoddy values the getrichquick compulsion and our surrender to the bitch goddess of material success our emphasis is on sex for gratification rather than deep organic emotional expression experience and communication we are unable to formulate a meaningful religion in spite of frenetic churchgoing and unable to rid ourselves of an archaic economic system that defies all laws of logic humanity and downright common sense and this in the most bountiful country in the world a country birthed in principles both noble and bold familiarized to us all as the american dream american culture places high value on appearances and beautyby all means one must be beautiful must conform to the stereotyped norms of socalled anglosaxon beauty and appearance along with this anglosaxon appearance comes the puritan ideology engulfing one in attitudes such as cleanliness is next to godliness but the next step in this train of thought as it applies to the negro is quite obvious he is made to feel dirty and consequently evil from the point of appearance alone the negro is not in step with the established and accepted norms and perhaps it is at just this point that a negro first begins to develop his sense of shame over his very blackness the black boy or girl learns much more early than we realize that there is something wrong with him that he isnt just an ordinary person that he has a stigma which he must live with for the rest of his life this sets up great waves of shame that engulf the entire personality the whole physical and psychological being the reason for the allpervasiveness of the feeling of shame is that shame has no specific focal point for cause shame is the result of a vague overall rejection the reasons for the rejection are irrational and without structure shame all too frequently has unknown roots i knew that shame was something i had to fight and for a group of people who have lived for hundreds of years as a shamed people it almost takes a conversion in the form of a religious experience to overcome that sense of shame accompanying the feeling of shame is a reaction pattern a theory which i developed in a sort of interaction between richard wright and myself it is what i have called the fearhatefear syndrome let me begin with a certain negro girl the only one that dared to enter an allwhite school walking the gauntlet of her fellow students who formed a double line and spat in her face as she passed that picture was on the front page of the new york times and but a few hours later was reproduced not only in pravda and izvestia but in paris london the scandinavian countries and in all of the nonwhite countries of the world including those we try to buy with socalled foreign aid as a writer i try to imagine what went on in this cruel drama what did the negro girl do when she got home what gave her such dignity and poise and what of the little white girls who had performed this ritual of spitting surely we have fouled our nest we have corrupted our children do you wonder then that there are black muslims in the united states who have found relief from this situation by openly hating all white people let me confess although i am for human dignity and would fight for whites if they were abused humiliated and spat upon there is a residue of hate in my heart as i think there is in most negroes living in the united states to explain this i developed a theory several years ago i wrote a speech in which i tried to state in technical terms what i believed to be the psychology of many negroes at that time although it is perhaps currently changing i quote i am convinced that at the core of the negros mentality there is a fearhatefear complex my assumption is that all men in western european civilization have unconscious guilt and fear of punishment for this guilt in the case of the dominant group this guilt is to a large extent irrational it can be shown to be false a figment of the imagination a holdover from early childhood experiences guilt can more easily be resolved by psychiatric treatment or even by rational cogitation but in the negro the psychological problem is ever intensified for him punishment in the actual environment is ever present violence psychological and physical leaps at him from every side the personality is brutalized by an unfriendly environment this reinforces and intensifies the normal insecurity he feels as a person living in our highly complex society such attacks on his personality lead to resentment and hatred of the white man however the certain knowledge that he will be punished if his hate emotions are discovered only compound this fear this is the negro reaction to his own brutalization subordination and hurt it is this vicious cycle in which the american negro is caught and in which his personality is pulverized by an evermounting selfpropelling rocket of emotional conflict the negro has been hurt he knows it he wants to strike back but he must notthere is evidence everywhere that to do so would lead to his destruction each of us is well aware of the brutalities that happened only yesterday i shall speak autobiographically to make my point more vivid my father was born a slave when i think of it now it is unbelievable that the body of my father could have been bought and sold like an ox or a horse i remember hearing in my childhoodi was tenof a negro who was lynched his genitals were cut off his living body then he was chained to a tree and burned alive they tied his carcass to a car and dragged it down the main street of the town do you doubt that that left a scar on my soul that some vestige of hate and fear remains although i have gone through psychoanalysis and am emotionally committed to the democratic ideal i learned that my problem as a person was no different from that of the japanese or the mexican i learned that it was the basic problem of adjustment to rejection and fear subordination whatever the cause produces the same result when that subjection is based on force and violence the inevitable product in the human personality must be fear and hate how has the negro dealt with his feelings of shame there are several paths open to the negro perhaps the one most in evidence today is the mass rejection of shame as the members of the mass strengthen each other by real or symbolic acts there is another path it is the redefinition of the past by discovering a more glorious past as it was imagined to have been in africa and of course there have been various negro nationalist movements from time to time i first saw this phenomenon when marcus garvey came to seattle to lead a nationalist parade garvey organized a million black americans and although his goals were foolish the pride he stirred in black hearts was very real i was just a young man then for it was back in the late twenties there had been a parade down second avenue the main street of seattle and thousands had followed their leader their messiah who was to lead them back to africa and to freedomthe honorable marcus aurelius garvey dcl founder of the black universal negro improvement association a selfeducated eloquent and fanatically zealous jamaican in the parade were negro women in the uniform of black cross nurses and others who wore wrapped puttees of the african motorcycle corps and in front the royal african legions rode on horses it was ludicrous and laughable but the black washerwomen were deadly serious and the black men laborers and servants had a pride that raised the demonstration out of the absurd and struck fear or admiration in the watchers on the dark faces for the first time there was pride and joy and fulfillment reflecting limpid faith in the completeness of living which they had found later on at a meeting at the star theatre i heard garvey deliver in deep resonant tones their slogan one god one aim one destiny for the garveyites he was a savior a messiah who promised to snatch them from the edge of the abyss and turn their grief into greatness he had put steel in the spines of negroes who had previously been ashamed of their color i tried to tell my parents about it later but when i described fat black washerwomen in tight motorcycle pants they laughed and i quickly stopped them saying dont laugh they were proud this is the first time i have ever seen negroes walking down the streets of a white city with pride and dignity the garvey movement was the only real mass movement among american negroes and it was based on glorifying things black the garveyites were going to have black cross nurses rather than white cross or red cross nurses a black house rather than a white house a black star steamship line rather than a white star line it was ludicrous certainly but it fulfilled a deep hunger in the hearts of more than a million american negroes a valid hunger a hunger that still exists in the or years since garvey that hunger has deepened been made more acute if america does not allow the negro to find pride in himself as an american then he will inevitably seek acceptance as a black man as for the black muslims their goals are just as foolish as garveys but they are appealing to the same hunger in that sense they are on valid ground i will not join them although i have been tempted i still hope for forgive me if i seem naivethe fulfillment of the american dream for all people no matter what color i havent given that up yet james baldwin writes to his nephew in my dungeon shook please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but their inhumanity and fear there is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept them with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it our failure to achieve a mature culture in which negroes and whites alike can accomplish some aspect of personality integration has within it the seeds of political fascism and if the emotionally truncated lives of negroes lead many of them to give up a fruitless struggle and submit to the certainty of a harsh dictator many whites in their immature longing for a meaning to their lives and for a security they have not been able to find act in a manner that would indicate they too are longing for the strong though cruel father who will dictate the functions of their lives there is another ideology that has profoundly affected the american negro the communist movement in the united states seized upon the scottsboro case and the crisis of the depression as a golden opportunity to seek recruits among negroes according to rayford logan soon after world war i the communists sought to win the support of negro workers in the north however the communists sixth world congress made a fatal mistake when in it resolved to work toward the formation of a separate black nation within the united states an overwhelming majority of negroes had no more desire to settle in a separate nation than they had to go back to africa but the communists sensing the propaganda value of the scottsboro trials stole the scottsboro case from the naacp and made violent attacks on w e b du bois who as editor of the crisis brilliantly exposed the fraudulent program of the communist party since most negroes knew of the work of men like du bois and had never heard of marx or lenin and also since they were fundamentally loyal americans despite their secondclass citizenship this communist maneuver won little confidence among negroes even in after five years of the depression and before the new deal had begun to reach down to negroes i estimate that less than negroes were members of the american communist party out of a total of party members the frequent shifting of the communist party position on the negro question after repeated the failures of the previous years and prevented the communists from building a permanent base within the negro community as professor wilson record has aptly said in his authoritative study american negroes refused to succumb to a siren song sung in bass quite apart from the failure of the communists to organize negroes they did provide a tremendous stimulant to the thinking and writing of negroes first the russian revolution itself startled the civilized world then when the communists started working with american negroes they offered them the hope that if black and white would unite there would be a free world this stimulated negroes to a further reconsideration of the possibility of a more meaningful existence but few negroes were aware of the depth of their distrust toward the whites besides the communist party in america used incredibly poor tactics the fundamental fact was that the negroes simply did not trust the white working class and its discriminatory labor unions and they did not trust them for good reason for the white working class had traditionally been the negroes enemy and in this there has been no fundamental change but the issue for some was more complicated thus richard wright for example a mississippi boy caught some vision of a different world as the result of the marxist influence he envisioned a world in which he could walk with dignity and he was for an important period of his life seduced by the communist vision which in a sense defeated the great potential that was his for his eventual disenchantment with the communists caused him to devote much of his later life and energy fighting them because they had tricked and lied to him that same energy might have gone into brilliant literary work yet one cannot ignore the fact that the communist party with all its failures still had immense influence on wright as a writer in his blueprint for negro writing published in the new challenge wright said in the lives of negro writers must be found those materials and experiences which will create a meaningful picture of the world today many young writers have grown to believe that a marxist analysis of society presents such a picture it creates a picture which when placed before the eyes of the writer should unify his personality organize his emotions buttress him with a tense and obdurate will to change the world and in turn this changed world will dialectically change the writer hence it is through a marxist conception of reality and society that the maximum degree of freedom in thought and feeling can be gained for the negro writer further this dramatic marxist vision when consciously grasped endows the writer with a sense of dignity which no other vision can give ultimately it restores to the writer his lost heritage that is his role as a creator of the world in which he lives and as a creator of himself i am inextricably concerned with the problems of the negro and with the possibility of enriching the american culture so i must act in some fashion for a tremendous racial confrontation is taking place confrontation is on old and honorable word which has recently come into current usage it means a direct facetoface meeting of people or peoples with conflicting interests ideas or values which must be resolved a confrontation may be resolved by a synthesis of these conflicting ideologies or beliefs or it may result in avoidance isolation or violence a confrontation is always a tense meaningful and fateful phenomenon me the snares of death confronted me is the text of psalms how much time have we to convince the americans and the world that democracy does not mean white domination not much i believe that the negro must get himself into positions of power we need laws and the continuation of picket lines and demonstrations to awaken our people and the whole of american society id like to quote richard wrights introductory essay to dr st clair drakes and my book black metropolis will the negro in the language of andre malraux find meaning in his humiliation make his slums and his sweatshops his modern cathedrals out of which will be born a new consciousness that can guide him toward freedom or will he continue as he does today saying joblike to the society that crushes him though it slays me yet will i trust in it this for richard wright was a rhetorical question long before many he had sensed the dictates of history if james baldwin is the poet of the negro revolt richard wright was its prophet in wright wrote the text of a picture book entitled million black voices which was both poetic and prophetic in it he stated we black folk our history and our present being are a mirror of all the manifold experiences in america what we want what we represent what we endure is what america is if we black folk perish america will perish if america has forgotten her past then i let her look into the mirror of our consciousness and she will see the living past living in the present for our memories go back through our black folk of today through the recollections of our black parents and through the tales of slavery told by our black grandparents to the time when none of us black or white lived in this fertile land the differences between black folk and white folk are not blood or color and the ties that bind us are deeper than those that separate us the common road of hope which we all have travelled has brought us into a stronger kinship than any words laws or legal claims look at us and know us and you will know yourselves for we are you looking back at you from the dark mirror of our lives what do we black folk want we want what others have the right to share in the upward march of american life the only life we remember or have ever known the lords of the land say we will not grant this we answer we ask you to grant us nothing we are winning our heritage though our toll in suffering is great the bosses of the building say your problem is beyond solution we answer our problem is being solved we are crossing the line you dared us to cross though we pay in the coin of death the seasons of the plantation no longer dictate the lives of many of us hundreds of thousands of us are moving into the sphere of conscious history we are with the new tide we stand at the crossroads we watch each new procession the hot wires carry urgent appeals print compels us voices are speaking men are moving and we shall be with them a scary story by nanina alba know i nuster

diane apliv r rs nelson had been to the kitchen to check on her or the screen door would have been latched when libby arrived she put her wallet on the window sill tied an apron around her short skirt and took out the bowl she used to mix biscuit dough she worked quickly her fingers measuring and stirring from habit her ears barely listening to the nelsons voices in the front room she put the biscuits in the oven and was bringing the breakfast dishes from the cabinet to the dining nook when mrs nelson came in to say good morning although the curlers had been taken from her hair she had not yet covered the dryflakesofoatmeal skin with makeup mrs nelson always seemed to stand in the middle of a busy room and after a year libby had become skilled in working around her libby mrs nelson turned her pale body toward the stove todays my club meeting day dont forget we have three tables this time mrs henderson has two ladies staying with her and ive invited another guest libby nodded her head and set the timer for the eggs as mrs nelson breathed heavily behind her back libbys features assumed the mask of pretendlistening is wicker over his cough yet mrs nelson leaned over and pinched a piece of biscuit dough that had fallen on the enamel top of the stove its too bad hes not going to be healthy like hal she said thats one good thing i can say about hal he was healthy enough to stir up devilment she dropped the dough into the stepon garbage can beside the stove libby lets have the watermelon pickle with the biscuits i want to use up this jar before it spoils libby nodded and walked toward the pantry sometimes she hated having to take things mrs nelson gave her ever since shed given wicker that old blanket to keep him warmer when he had the flu she thought she owned him she always said she was taking care of him hoping he didnt turn out like his father mrs nelson continued to talk as she walked to the other side of the kitchen i told his aunt he was going to be no good she said leaning inside the refrigerator spending all that time fooling around with papas old car youd think if he wanted to be a mechanic hed stay around here and learn the trade he could still be working at the esso station but no he decides to change jobs you know she turned toward libby i still wonder why he didnt marry that little thompson girl they were two of a kind mrs nelson looked distastefully at her fingers that were sticky from the biscuit dough hurry up she said wiping her hand on a towel mr nelson has to leave early libby ignored her mrs nelson was always saying mean things about hal and libby had the hardest time holding her temper every time libby thought about the woman pumping her friend sally about things that did not concern her she got plain angry just because sally worked for mrs henderson mrs nelson thought she could poke her nose into libbys business libby didnt understand why mrs nelson didnt come right out and ask if she were married she could understand how the woman might be curious about where hal was living but that gave her no reason for spreading lies going around making people think all libbys five children were bastards god you cant trust none of them she said poking extra hard inside the pickle jar with the spatula according to sally mrs nelson had asked about the identity of the father of libbys baby she hinted sally said that libby bought herself a wedding band instead of hal giving her the ring libby took the biscuits out of the oven and began buttering the insides the funny thing was she honestly thought mrs nelson had believed her when she said her husband was up north working she hadnt lied really the last postcard she had from hal said he was working in a canning factory upstate she saw no reason to say that card had been written almost a year ago during her working hours she tried to avoid thinking about her husband calvin had been nothing but a baby when he left at first she figured he only had left them for the summer lots of fellows she knew up and took off for a couple of months but they usually came back in the fall not hal he didnt ever do anything according to a set pattern one day he was working in the drug store and coming home and loving her at night and the next thing she knew he was off and gone again some people just have a wandering bug in them she looked around her at the sunlit kitchen comparing it to the narrow kitchen in her own home sometimes meetrie didnt believe her when she told the children about the food the nelsons had for breakfast talking about bacon and waffles made meetries eyes shine for real she would ask pulling her top pigtail for real and sometimes when she was pouring those cornflakes into the four cups and stretching the powdered milk with more water than the welfare lady ever intended she didnt believe herself this morning when she had tied a dish towel around wickers neck and sat down to spoon feed him his corn flakes meetrie made a regular nuisance of herself waiting for his leftover cereal asking every five seconds if he had finished eating every day this week she had come walking into mrs nelsons house exactly on time and every day mrs nelson came into the kitchen to see if she possibly could come a little earlier she put the eggs into the coddies and picked up the butter to carry to the table she had left her own house in a mess as usual yesterday was so rainy the doors stayed shut all day and the odor of urine from the childrens room invaded the whole house but she was not at home now she was working in another house nudging the swinging door with her elbow she pushed her way into the dining room as libby washed the breakfast dishes the kitchen seemed to become uncomfortably hot mrs nelson cleared the table and brought the last dishes to the sink did you take wicker back to the doctor she took the cups from mrs nelson when i took him the first time the doctor said it was hay fever and hed probably outgrow it it seemed to libby that if mrs nelson were so concerned about wicker she would suggest bringing all the children to play in her backyard during the day that way libby could keep an eye on them herself libby let the dishwater drain and rinsed her hands and face in cold water to cool off if mrs dickens didnt soon move calvin from the laundry basket on her porch the sun would be shining right into his face every morning when she put him and the clean diapers into the basket she found herself wishing her mother were well enough to look after the baby although with that last sickness coming back off and on she didnt feel right saddling her mother with her own problems she had asked mrs dickens if she could leave calvin inside the house but according to mrs dickens sixthirty was too early to be fooling with a baby besides shed said everybody around heres got too many babies to have to steal one off my front porch in the middle of the day right when libby was glazing the ham mrs nelson insisted on having a hot lunch what upset her most about the woman was the way she could come up with more work when libby was busiest mrs nelson was good for thinking up foolishness especially if it meant working overtime usually libby didnt mind staying late without notice except once she stopped puncturing the ham with cloves to count back it must have been two christmases ago and she wished she had that three dollars now she saved for months to buy hal a new fishing rod and had managed to put one in layaway then on the last day that she could make a payment before the store put the rod back into stock mrs nelson made her stay late to help with the church baking sale all the while she was icing those simple santa claus faces she was watching the clock hands pass the stores closing hours then when she was ready to go home mrs nelson gave her a small bag full of broken pieces and cookies that were too brown to sell she put the ham into the oven and opened a can of tomato soup for mrs nelsons lunch at home about now meetrie was scavenging around the neighbors fruit trees for apples since libby never knew what fruit would be there for the picking she always left out cold boiled potatoes for the children to eat sometimes there was enough food to make a sandwich for them to share during the afternoon when mrs nelson was safely away taking minutes of the bridge club meeting in the living room libby pulled out a bundle of roughdried clothes from a shelf in the pantry once a week usually when mrs nelson was spending the morning away from home she did her wash and some of her mothers clothes in the electric machine hers was such a paltry weekly wash she smoothed the iron over a long piece of embroidered ribbon meetries favorite possession here and there the colored threads were becoming unwoven but meetrie would rather wear that ribbon than anything in the world hal brought it home for her to wear to sunday school and there had been enough left over to make a bracelet for meetries slender arm now the folded ribbon that she tucked into a blouse pocket looked as if it might disintegrate into shreds at five oclock libby folded up the ironing board tucked the clothes behind the cake boxes on the bottom shelf and began counting out plates for the cold buffet she was soaping a heavy mixing bowl in which shed made potato salad when she heard a noise in the backyard noises that time of evening never disturbed her she imagined one of the neighborhood dogs was loose although mrs nelson swore up and down she would get rid of the next animal that dug up her chrysanthemum bed she had begun rinsing the silver when she thought she heard footsteps approaching the house for no reason at all she felt chilled but then the footsteps stopped and she knew she was being silly this time of year she had seen lots of people wandering through the neighborhood looking for odd jobs or something to eat besides the kitchen had become too steamy and warm to do anything but settle into the quiet routine of cleaning when mrs nelson came through the swinging door carrying the last of the dessert plates she involuntarily jumped why libby what on earth is wrong with you you jumped like a scared rabbit cat nothing maam i guess im tired from this heat with the inside of her arm she wiped the perspiration from her forehead that husband of yours should get himself home mrs nelson said intently watching her face and sliding the dishes into the sink goodness girl she popped her fingers again into the dishwater this water is ice cold then as if she had not interrupted herself she turned toward libby with him home you wouldnt have to do both your work and his libby nodded her head the way she always did mumbled something that sounded like yes maam and busied herself arranging the kitchen curtains until she was certain mrs nelson had left the room she stored the silver in the chest put away the company china and went to see if mrs nelson had anything else for her to do the door to the downstairs bedroom was closed and since mr nelson usually ate thursday dinner in town she was finished for the day she returned to the kitchen and picked up two waxed paper packages she had stuck behind the serving bowls in the cabinet she dropped them into a paper bag and cautiously opened the refrigerator door she counted the leftover salads decided against taking any and saw how much sliced ham was left after slipping four large slices into her bag she checked the front and side doors to make sure mrs nelson was shut in and left by the back door outside she hardly could tell that the season had changed from summer to fall the air was still and humid hanging over the trees preventing the green leaves from changing to red and yellow the sleeveless blouse she wore felt surprisingly light after the heavy starched uniform she had worn all day as she walked across the green lawn and toward the tool shed that bordered the summer vegetable garden she could hear the quiet humming of the crickets libby saw that the door was open which was strange the nelsons had never locked the shed but kept the door closed to keep out the dogs she was on her way to shut the door when she saw him standing by the wooden building hal her lips silently formed the word still she was not certain and her feet kept moving toward the wooden shed hal she called softly her voice was inaudible she was almost upon him now and from the way he reached into his pocket for a match she could tell he had been watching her all along she wondered for a minute what she would say she had imagined him coming home but not at a crazy time like this yet she felt strangely sure of herself certain that she was in no danger of making a fool of herself by crying she kept walking toward him and even this far away she could see the high cheekbones that marked all of their children as belonging to him hello libby he said blocking the path in front of her and reaching for her she knew he was kissing her and she was standing still kissing him back but the whole moment seemed so unreal all the while he held her she was wondering how he thought he could just come back as if hed never left her before finally she pulled away and his arms dropped to his side she watched his hands slip into his pants pocket i didnt think you were never coming back she said still facing him and smelling the cheap aftershave lotion he always used since before he started shaving where you been she looked past him at the hedge on the side of the yard wondering why she should notice how he smelled after that last card i didnt have no way of knowing which way you were heading and here you are coming back like theres not no reason for me to say i dont want you back the words came out in a rush matching the tears that were falling on her cheeks hal stood quietly with the same solid unconcerned expression that always made her angry when she was upset his arm reached out to her but she pushed him away who do you think you are anyway she demanded swallowing the sobs who do you think you are going away for as long as you please she was shouting now and to her ears her voice seemed apart from the rest of her suddenly she was pummeling his shoulders with her fists and before she realized what she had done she felt the side of her cheek smarting from the pressure of his hand oh she whispered staring at him calm yourself down girl his voice was gruff you give me a chance to explain you hear he took hold of her hand as if to keep her from striking him ive been working girl i needed to get away you think id write you those cards if i wasnt planning on coming back she stared at him her eyes following the green diagonal pattern in his shirt on down to the cotton twill pants that were so new they still had a crease down the front i just had to get away for a while seems like those children were making me crazy always running around not ever being still now dont you go saying i dont love you or those kids he stopped talking and looked straight at her if i didnt i wouldnt be coming back here the least you could have done was to tell me where you were her voice began to falter wicker and hamlet dont even ask about you no more they aint seen you in so long they forgot about you she was talking so fast her words seemed to pile up on each other people in town were all the time asking when you were coming back and i didnt have anything to tell them hal stood quietly listening to her he didnt even say anything when she stopped to catch her breath i got me a job we were getting along without you suddenly she couldnt say anything else there wasnt any sense in lying lots of times she wished hal was at home to help her decide things about the children this morning like every other morning for the past month she had to drag wicker from under the kitchen table he was all the time crawling under something yelling his head off and she didnt know what to do about him howd you know where i was i asked around he answered one of the boys in the drugstore said he thought you worked full time out here she swallowed quickly thinking that he couldnt even let her be the first person to know he was home well i had to find you he said as if understanding her thoughts i stopped by the house but meetrie wouldnt talk to me and wouldnt let the others even get close took the candy i brought them though dont you ever get them anything sweet to eat reckon they knew who you were she waited for him to understand the meaning of her words what you doing buying candy anyway they cant wear candy on their feet hal ignored her i got them some other things outside they didnt seem to have too many toys to play with howd you get out here he looked too freshly pressed to have walked from town on the dusty road i got me a car he said pointing across a field parked it over there near the path he was grinning like he expected her to be pleased a car her voice was dull a car libby stood unbelieving they wouldnt have any use for it except to go to town weekends they didnt have money to be buying gas besides all their friends and even the church were right in their neighborhood its not a new one but its all paid for i got it to get me home i even made enough money to get brand new seat covers hal said proudly bet you thought we wouldnt never have a car she nodded her head dully heh honey remember before we were married we talked about getting one of those little fords you know with the two seats in front one like we were going to get to drive up north his voice sounded wistful and he waited to see if she remembered seeing no bit of recognition in her eyes he kept talking i could have gotten me one of those dirt cheap but at the last minute i sort of changed my mind she stood as if in a spell listening to his voice and wondering how he could be so excited over a car he didnt even act like he had just slapped her come on he grabbed her hand lets go look i got it painted blue just like you always wanted libby felt tears washing her eyes blue was her favorite color yet she couldnt for the life of her understand him here they were needing to get the house fixed up so the chimney didnt smoke when the cold came she still hadnt paid the doctor his money from the last time calvin was in the hospital and he decided to bring home a car she turned toward him now that youre here you going to sell it he looked in the direction where the car was parked and again at her no he said not meeting her eyes im going to keep it bet meetrie would like riding in a car and the little fellows too suddenly he smiled its got brand new pipes the man up north put them on special for me libby you should hear this baby when i take off he kept on talking about the car forcing her to listen she couldnt even understand why he was so excited about exhaust pipes where they lived there werent that many other people who could listen out for hals car she remained quiet as he finished smoking and dropped the cigarette butt on the ground crushing the tiny red light with the heel of his shoe he still held her by the hand almost pulling her along as they began walking across the field what you going to do for a job she asked hurrying to keep up with him she always forgot how tall he was until she had to try and walk beside him he had a certain rhythm to his walk and she listened to their footsteps hitting the brittle grass still too fast for you he smiled down at her matching his long strides with her fast short steps oh ill get my old job back he said his brown eyes were smiling webberll be glad to get me back after fooling with those slow niggers libby knew he was right every time she went to the drugstore mr webber made a special point of asking when she was expecting hal home hal was talking but not particularly to her havent seen this old town in so long just about forgotten what everything looks like his eyes came to rest on the brown bag she still clutched in her hand whats that leftovers for the children she answered i dont like for them to go to bed without anything in their stomachs mrs nelson give it to you no i guess she knows i take whats left wherere you planning to get money to buy gas the esso man wont give you no credit unless you been working steady around here he ignored her his voice insistent she know you took this food mrs nelson never gives away anything unless its spoiled he did not say another word until they reached the car and she was too tired to talk her whole body felt drained she only wanted to see the car up close touch it and see it at the same time to end the moment she was dreading and hope she didnt start crying as she stood looking at the old ford she felt her tongue almost stick to her throat she walked to the front of the car and the headlights seemed to make a face at her in the dusky twilight she could see the fresh paint and the chromium parts were shining even seeing it parked there just a few steps away she still could not believe he had brought home a car when they needed everything else then hal was standing quietly beside her his arms around her shoulder pressing her close to him get in he said opening the door he pressed the button to lock her in and strode around to the drivers side she watched while he pushed in the key seeing past the dusty tint of the front windows past the flat countryside she looked out at the windowdarkened cotton fields and at the scrawny trees in the distance the trees were stuck to the edge of the fields as if the men who cleared the ground had been too lazy to finish their work she looked at the road she had walked this morning seeing how it seemed to blend into the sameness of the surrounding land the starting motor interrupted her thoughts and then hal was talking i said did you want to stop by your mamas before we go home she did not answer he seemed to have a knack for making her do things she never planned on doing but if she wanted him she had to want the car there wasnt any sense in even thinking about fixing up the house now all their extra money would go for gas but at least he had come back to her and somehow nothing else was very important she settled back into the seat her eyes drawn to the profile of his headthe hair closely cut his eyes so intent on the road that if she had not known better she would have expected traffic miraculously to appear no she said putting the paper bag on the seat between them the children are going to want you to play with them before they go to bed we might as well pick up the baby and go home by julia fields r damon millers wife passed his chair twice she was making trips from the aic table to the refrigerator in order to set the table for a little party for the two of them they had been talking of the event which gave rise to this party she had done the more talking while mr miller had done the more thinking the more remembering yesterday he had bought for her the huge bouquet of carnations now on the table in front of him he also had bought a set of french paring knives and a little gold locket he was remembering the look she gave him when he had given her those gifts she had grown into the opposite of what she might have or even should have her hands when she placed the candle holder on the table were two stubby cups of flesh masses of flesh it seemed matched only by the ringlets which comprised her neck her two gray eyes settled into her hugeness of body until she looked very much like a great carnivorous monster when she came near his chair he diminished in size he felt that if she said again happy anniversary he would simply disappear behind the impact of her strong clear voice he hoped she would not say this he couldnt bear to hear her say another word he grew ashamed for these thoughts but they became more intense on her third trip she brought two small vegetable salads going around his chair clumsily on her overburdened feet he did not move she would certainly say but dear you promised to sit with me dont leave please really dont you promised like a childs record her voice would catch his ears and the fat hands would clutch his own damon dear he made himself sit deathly still he looked at his watch it was ten of seven now she sat heavily upon a chair she had shredded a carrot and had begun to eat it in a testy manner in the same way he had watched her as she tasted a bit of each of the courses for the party during the early years of their marriage he had urged her to eat for she had been a finicky and fussy nibbler then he delighted in putting his hands around her waist and lifting her into the sky although he was himself of almost the same height and weight as she now she made two of him he could hear her saying something punctuated with the word dear but it seemed to him that she had no right to be endearing herself to him that this strange fat creature with whom he had been sitting for two hours should make no reference at all to him for years he had sat at this table at seven oclock eating his dinner with her across from him for years he had told her about his job as fireman on the train she had listened and made comments she had smiled and perhaps he had been humorous and they had planned something or they had regretted having no family no children the candles glow caught the sparkle in her eyes she was looking from the candles to the cake on which was the lovely candied decoration he stood kissed her cheeks he smiled at her but she didnt seem to notice amazed he sat and looked at her it occurred to him that she had ceased to actually see hear or feel his presence then she glanced at him he became numb well dear she said arent you after all its our he knew what she would say he knew the whole drama the set piece and the dialogue just a second he got up from the table he could hear her chuckling to herself as he walked down the hallway in their bedroom he took his payroll check from the cash envelope and endorsed it it was what he always did on fridays she could cash it tomorrow she always did on saturdays he put the extra cash into his pocket and into a valise he put clean socks handkerchiefs and shirts he must hurry get out out if he heard her voice just once more he could waste time around the station until the train left at eightthirty they would not be unduly curious afterward he could begin to become anonymous as he glided past the door he could hear the tinkle of silver she was eating he laughed aloud to himself but he was careful not to allow the door to slam he glanced at his watch and shook it furiously for it still stood at ten of seven and then he began to run very fast for a man of his age very very fast noblesse oblige by eloise greenfield knew it was tuesday before the m dream was finished by the time she vjtiic opened her eyes she had progressed through the various phases of anticipation from vague contentedness to the realization that this was the day of her weekly visit to the childrens home in the city james would be sitting in his chair by the window waiting for her she stretched and tinges of pink bespattered her skin as she thought of james a blanket of wellbeing enclosed her in its warmth most of the children at the home were slightly reserved but he was extremely so and few emotions stirred the surface of his dark face though his reticence formed a barrier between them marian was confident that with patience she would be able to free his natural ebullience it was a pity she thought that so many people lived without giving of themselves to others and missed the gratification that came with witnessing the transformation of a face by gratitude they leave their religion at the church door she often told fred getting up marian slid her feet into the mules beside the bed and put on the yellow flowered robe she thought with pleasure of her other tuesday appointment passing the bathroom she went down to the kitchen where danny had left the milk on the table and the absence of dirty pans told her that breakfast had again consisted of a sandwich ill have to speak to him about that she thought breaking an egg into the small frying pan she felt a twinge of guilt about not cooking breakfast for danny and fred but her plans to relinquish some of her exhausting charity positions had to wait until there was someone to replace her intuition told her that it was probably for the best since a twelve year old should be taught a sense of responsibility and fred ate at a cafe near the office she assumed the traditional position of reverence and asked a blessing before beginning to eat marians model had been her father in moments of discouragement and weariness she conjured up the vision of john hinton a tax lawyer not very high on the social ladder but towering and stately in his humility and concern for others remember daughter hed said frequently in his chantlike bass noblesse oblige we the noble must honor our obligations the hobo who had come to their door when marian was ten or eleven was a permanent and often used fixture in her memory he had been almost chinless and his face was a puffy chocolate with black borders of hair on each side the family had been about to start dinner when her father answered the knock at the back door mr hinton had stridden back to the dining room removed his dinner from the table plate and fork included and given them to the hobo through the window marian had watched as the man thanked him with several slight nods of his head and sat on the steps to eat there had been a fleeting enigmatic flame in his eyes that frightened her so that she had looked at her father for reassurance mr hintons chin was thrust forward at an angle that was familiar to marian and made her secure once more his eyes glowed and a thwarted smile hovered at the comers of his mouth he had never seemed taller than when he reentered the house filled another plate and joined the family at the table when they had finished dinner the hobo the plate and the fork had disappeared well thats the way they are mr hinton had lamented all we can do is keep trying upstairs again marian found that she had lingered too long over breakfast to take a bath sponging herself quickly she lotioned and dabbed cologne in strategic spots she dressed carefully in matching blue lingerie and the dark blue sheath dress that accentuated her height and combed her brown hair into the soft style that fred liked marian always tried to please fred because she didnt love him she thought of him as her captor a kind unwitting captor but one who had frustrated her plans for a life of service to the unfortunate as an adolescent she had visualized herself in the sparkling white of a nurse or as a dedicated social worker bringing comfort into the hovels of the poor to have married because of a pregnancy that turned out to be a false alarm was the irony of her life she bitterly regretted the naivete of little marian just out of high school who had chosen marriage over the other alternative marian went into dannys room and hurriedly scrawled a note on his bulletin board sandwiches for breakfast ill be home about leftovers in refrig got home too late to see you last night so love love love glancing at her watch she saw that she would have to rush in order to keep both appointments the second was as important to her as the visit with james if not more so she snatched one of dannys old books from the shelf and dropped it into her purse before she left as marian drove she practiced the nursery tune she would teach james today if she had enough time the sun glinted on the car hood making in conjunction with passing shadows varicolored figures that danced to her music she had almost driven past lauras when she remembered that her friend had asked for a ride into the city thanks for the lift laura said sliding into the car i have some shopping to do at taylors for the kids how are harry and the kids marian asked pulling out again into the traffic just fine harrys staying at the apartment in the city tonight weekly meeting marian wished silently that laura would occasionally think of someone other than harry and the kids that she would show some concern for children like james who were the result of immorality and neglect she ached at the injustice that allowed these children to suffer because their parents wanted nothing more than to live like animals gratifying every whim without thought of consequences she saw her duty clearlyto teach cleanliness and morals to those less fortunate no matter how difficult it was after dropping laura off at taylors marian continued the drive to the childrens home she found james in the recreation room not playing with the other children but as always sucking his thumb and staring out the window hello there she said cheerfully extricating his thumb yourefive now james much too big for that james bottom lip gave a weak tremor but she pretended not to notice she tucked his shirttail into the faded green boxer shorts between the shorts and socks that had long since lost their elasticity thin ashen legs projected marian made a mental note to bring lotion the following week she stroked his head briskly with the brush shed bought for him and wiped his shoes with a piece of tissue she first dampened with her tongue thats better she told him now if youll just smile youll be almost as handsome as my little boy james extended his lips sidewards in a straight line taking from her purse the book shed brought marian sat beside him and read with enthusiasm speaking distinctly and changing her voice for all the different characters james sat quietly showing no reaction once when his thumb started slowly toward his mouth she stopped it without looking up and without anger deceit she realized was another enemy for her to fight she understood that it wasnt his fault the halfhour was over before marian finished the story but she couldnt remain longer or she would be late for her other appointment she left the book with james after coaxing him to smile and say thank you traffic was surprisingly light on crawford st and marian was relieved she was hardly in a mood to fight each inch of the way this had been her fourth visit with james and still there was not a sign of improvement she wondered whether any good could come of a sacrifice that evidently wasnt appreciated she was sure that even her father if he were alive would agree that james was beyond help next week she decided she would request another child pulling into the department store parking lot she maneuvered into the one space left on the first ramp walked through the store and left by the main entrance she walked four blocks east just as she reached the white stone apartment building on the corner of fourth and jefferson an envelope dropped from the pocket of a boy who passed her young man she called picking up the envelope she smiled brightly to show her friendliness as she handed it to him although the boy was obviously not yet out of his teens his composed brown face and his poise as he thanked her revealed a peculiar maturity he bowed low a grateful smile creasing his face but his eyes were the eyes of the hobo from her childhood and her fright was a relapse into the past the boy turned and left but this time marian had read the eyes correctly she was positive she would never understand them she had tried to help him and he had responded with hatred oh well she thought with a brave toss of her head noblesse oblige she forgot the boy as she turned into the building and with a surge of emotion rode the elevator to harrys apartment
memo to a nation by ronald williams nfortunately it u appears that little has been learned from the race riots of the summer of the usual observations and comments have been made racial discrimination unemployment poor housing ignorance police brutality and poverty have all been cited as causes all of these deplorable conditions have created abject despair in the black ghettos as far as this reasoning goes it manifests a partial truth and isolates obvious symptoms what is most lamentable is that no one commenting on the plight of the northern negro has bothered to carry his diagnosis to its logical conclusion the rioters vented a despair with our democratic process as they have come to know it for them it is a way of life that has frustrated and aborted their dreams of a better life it would be facetious to think of their despair as being general and aimless the los angeles rioters words and targets for destruction were all too pointed if not confused and ill directed further a people suffering from diffused hopelessness seldom riot riots are born of hope how meaningless to the rioters are all the federal laws attempting to enfranchise the southern negro in the north and west the negro has enjoyed the right to vote to patronize most restaurants air terminals and hotels recently these have not been the goals of the northern negro he has voted and moreover he has elected negro politicians to office in the past and even the present the white northern politicians have used whatever means suitable to placate their ethnically diverse electorate they have been all things to all people when among the italians they have been lovers of spaghetti and the glory of rome at the same time they have attempted to calm these white citizens about the negroes encroaching on their neighborhoods when among the slavic people the irish and the polish the same approach has been used these politicians have failed to give leadership to either the white or negro electorate when addressing their white voters they have appealed to their fears and prejudices and at the same time have venerated if not sanctified the status quo regarding housing and the schools when among negroes these same politicians have mouthed platitudes vacuous promises and humiliating pleas for patience for practical purposes and political expediency few have appealed to their citizens sense of justice democratic idealism and a dream of a better life for all this lack of political imagination and faith in our democratic system has invaded and permeated all phases of citygovernment the slums and corruption in most northern cities are the end products of governing cynics who would rather serve consecutive years in office with a hope for a higher position in government than lead courageously confronted with explosive antagonisms hatreds and fears in their cities many of these men are still searching for the expedient way as though what confronts them will go away freeing them to return to their jobs of misgoverning in addition the white northern politicians have given patronage and favors to a few negroes usually precinct and ward bosses it is the same pattern used all over the world whether on the plantations in the colonies among the peasants of europe or wherever in order to keep the masses in line a few men are selected for this purpose and given the trappings of prestige and power plus a few favors and it works until the people are awakened during the last twentyfive years most urban centers have been governed by men of mediocre talents men who have lacked vision men who have placed personal ambition above the duties of office and men who have been too susceptible to influences of all kinds most large cities have monuments dedicated to these mens disservice if not criminal conduct the sprawling slums vice ridden streets overcrowded schools and other decaying conditions are their legacy to the future these pitiable politicians had plenty of assistance the realestate blocks fought to keep taxes down they fought to preserve the black ghetto by opposing fair housing the industrialist and business man wanted peace and low taxes the pressure groups among the white power structure wanted social and economic conditions to improve without changing the comfortable and profitable structure although the negro in watts harlem hough and other ghettos sees his enemy as white his enemy wears all the colors of men he is fighting corruption and penuriously ambitious men who desire wealth and position and assume few social or democratic responsibilities in the black ghetto there is a constant cry of police brutality in one northern city there are at least seven negro councilmen serving the city these negro councilmen have made few if any attempts to investigate these allegations of police brutality to meet with the citizenry and police representatives to promote understanding and reciprocal responsibility while doing nothing officially to eliminate police brutality or to exonerate the police force the negro politicians decry police brutality in their wards the police departments are placed in the precarious and untenable position of attempting to preserve law and order where respect for law and order no longer exists in watts the police were referred to as the occupying force to the negro in the slums the police are protecting the mans system which is by definition the enemy what the negro has not learned is that the man is not always white the police also have their burden to bear they cannot demand respect from a citizenry that pays them off to operate numbers rackets speakeasies and to pander the dialectics of this kind of situation are unavoidable contemptuous disdain for police and law results only a fool would expect other consequences and further it should be apparent to all that the police enforce the law only with the consent of the vast majority of a population without this consent occupation best describes their function it would be foolhardy and an invitation to all kinds of extremists to encourage more stringent law enforcement without attempting to solve the basic source of hatred for law and order and as long as the people of the black ghetto believe that the police represent a white monolithic power whose only aim is to contain suppress exploit and brutalize them the basic attitudes and problems have not been touched again we see one more symptom of despair with a democratic system which has shown its weaknesses and contempt for a people forcing them to embrace a value system and attitudes which are antithetical to the highest ideals of democracy if the negro of the ghetto were to embrace the expressed values of white society it would be tantamount to selfnegation and insanity one would think that the negroes in the black ghetto would be able to discuss their grievances with school administrators and reach settlements acceptable to both groups for years the schools have cried for parental interest and involvement with the educational process their pronounced goal has been the whole child when a levy was needed community schools has been the pass word street clubs community councils and civil_rights groups have found boards of education and school administrators unreceptive and resentful of their concerns and complaints perhaps what is most frightening about all of these people responsible for public education is the impression they convey that they and only they are qualified to have opinions about the education of children parents who resent halfday sessions for their children who complain of overcrowded classrooms who challenge a curriculum that frustrates and retards their children and who want a modern technical training program for their high schools are treated as subversives these parents are called trouble makers usually aroused by a hard core of trouble makers yet the problems persist educators and boards of education spend more time and energy attacking their critics and address too little effort to eliminating the problems which cause the criticism there are many whites in the urban centers who judge a school excellent if it is all white as one teacher in a large northern city stated all children regardless of social status race or religion receive the same education in this townan inferior one theres no prejudice here it is not accidental that a small number of merit scholarships if any are awarded to children from the urban center last year in one large city the only student awarded a merit scholarship was a negro girl whites also have every reason to be alarmed about their educational system unfortunately the white middle class has fled to the suburbs leaving the lower class whites who as yet have not thoroughly examined their educational system whites within the central city have become staunch defenders of the neighborhood school concept it has become more than a concept it is discussed as though it were an inviolate right frankly i fail to see the advantage of a white child sitting next to a negro child and both receiving the same miseducation in the same overcrowded classroom and if sitting next to a white child will prevent sociopsychological mutilation then there are thousands of negroes in cleveland chicago los angeles and other large cities who have escaped this malady during the thirties and forties many of these negroes sat next to white children it is questionable whether this limited school contact changed either the negro or white child that much certainly during high school white and negro contacts were confined to school affairs and nonschool social contacts were limited if at all many civil_rights leaders psychologists and sociologists are of the opinion that if a school is integrated that the negro child will receive a better education because the schools have higher standards for whites this is a partial truth if the white children are from poor families and if their parents are not vocal and do not insist on equality education they will receive the same education as the negro child most of the white parents who are concerned about their childrens education have moved to the suburbs or enrolled their children in private schools the majority of whites remaining in the central city are in the same boat as the negro the only difference is they just are not aware of their plight yet or the dire consequences of miseducation their children must bear in the future the public school problem in the black ghetto reveals another area where those who persist in attempting to use all legal and democratic procedures to effect change have been forced into the streets and demonstrations those negroes attempting to use normal channels such as through meetings discussions with school authorities and community leaders to effect changes in their schools have usually met frustration patronizing indulgence and the contumely of the school administrators and boards of education where words have failed sitins and demonstrations have succeeded in some instances consequently those who have opposed and closed the door on discussion have taught the negro that demonstrations picketing and sitins are their most effective bargaining tools admittedly this is a pathetic commentary on the nation that is attempting to instruct the world in democratic procedure in the north the black ghetto has been without leadership in the past the naacp has attracted the support of the negro middle class recently core chapters have been established in the ghetto but have not as yet captured the imagination and following of the people for the most part negro ministers have concerned themselves with the hereafter today these ministers are treated with derision and contempt too many of these men of the cloth have pointed their congregations heart toward the heavens while they have cruised the ghetto in cadillacs expensive clothing and lived in garish homes to fill this leadership vacuum many groups have arisen in the ghetto boards of education city administrators and politicians have called these groups extremist this produces a perplexing paradox during the initial stage of civil discontent with the schools police housing inspectors community councils and other less militant groups were brushed aside rendering them ineffectual in the eyes of the ghetto now that more militant organizations have arisen and are unwilling to be pushed aside these groups are called radical and irresponsible there is one lesson that all negro and whites had better learn today no one will lead in the ghetto unless he voices in unequivocable words the discontents of the ghetto the respected negro professional business man or politician does not lead in the ghetto their absence during the riots in los angeles was by design and not by accident the negro middle class fled the black ghetto for the same reasons the white middle class abandoned the central city these black professionals clerks and small business men have contributed little leadership financial investment or spiritual encouragement to their less fortunate brothers they have concerned themselves with homes in the suburbs cars swimming pools cotillions and all the frills and leisurely decadence of their class tragically this middle class is an imitation of the white middle class it has all the pretensions and decadence but for the most part have no capital working for them most of these middle class negroes are running scared to maintain their recently acquired standard of living and all important appearance the negro middle class does not have a history of frugality civic responsibility and financial investment in our economy the black suburbanite was born in imitation and decadence its creative period belongs to the future for the most part they would rather have the negroes in the ghetto become more moderate after all things are much better today for the negro obviously there is no easy answer to the problems of the black ghetto the answers that will emerge and are tried will deeply change our entire american way of life of this most people are assured the primary need in the ghetto is to rekindle faith in our democratic procedure i do not minimize the need for jobs training education and food but if the lower class negro is to enter our society as a productive and creative person he must have faith in the dem ocratic system he also must make a contribution toward his habilitation not only a contribution but assume leadership and give direction to his own destiny there are those who for a number of reasons do not want the poor represented in the policy making level in these habilitative programs if the people of watts harlem and hough cannot produce their own responsible leadership and assist in their own economical and educational habilitation we had better withdraw from viet nam and all the other backward nations of the world surely if we cannot effect self determination in our own country we must fail abroad where disparate cultures languages and histories compound our problems regardless of how many demonstrations riots and sitins follow eventually someone must sit down and discuss the issues if local groups neighborhood clubs and community councils were to take an active part in planning and executing these programs it would give them the dignity and the responsibility for their own futures that charity and patronage have eroded naturally there are going to be problems there are class and racial antagonisms to be dealt with professionals are going to think that they are in a better position to understand diagnose and plan perhaps so if so they should be able to persuade by revealing information and reasoning these professionals have a responsibility to educate these negro leaders these professionals also have a responsibility to learn often what separates them from the untutored negro leaders is vocabulary hardly meriting the weight usually given it dialogues must be established with boards of education police departments and other agencies problems must be discussed openly and honestly above all positive results must emerge on both sides if not there are always those waiting to denounce these procedures and take to the ctreets the people will take to the streets rightly so if we fail to provide them with an effective means of settling their grievances opening discussions and meetings on the street level appear to be the only solution today there is no organization which can command a sizeable following and control over the ghetto for that the authorities should be thankful but unless action is taken to enlist the participation of the black ghetto to improve conditions and establish confidence in democratic procedures we had better be prepared to face the consequences of this inaction if that sad day should come we will have forsaken the dream that we now offer the world and without this hope and this dream does america have anything to offer that is not now in abundance up from paternalism by the rev c eugene askew he p ost civil war era that could with some justification be identi fied by the title of booker t washingtons autobiography up from slavery has at long last given way to a time of increasing civil_rights for minority groups there are abundant indications that in the near future assured civil_rights for every american citizen will be a reality now there lies ahead an era which can perhaps be characterized as up from paternalism an age much more subtle since it is in the realm of intangible attitudes civil_rights can be gained through political power respect other than for power alone cannot on the whole nonviolent negro demonstrations boycotts sitins and the like have gained not only civil_rights but also a growing respect for negroes from the white community moreover with rapidly expanding cultural educational and employment opportunities for negroes the gap inevitably will be narrowed between the negro and white worlds with both an increased sense of dignity within negroes and a belated recognition of the negros capabilities by the hitherto considerably more privileged white citizens it also is inevitable that attitudes will change as negro and white people work play and study together on a free and equal basis while i am willing to sacrifice my convenience for genuine integration i must confess that i am enjoying this interim period while the white people in houston get used to integration of our public facilities my wife and i sit in the unreserved section to watch the houston astros home baseball games we have found both to our regret for the still prevailing racial prejudice and to our secret delight at our personal good fortune that even at wellattended games we can arrive at game time and still find excellent seats on the first or second row next to negroes we shall either have to go earlier or miss our choice seats when this particular kind of prejudice disappears the same situation is found at motion picture theatres but to a lesser degree perhaps when some white people get used to the dark and realize that they are sitting next to negroes they do not want to make a fetish of moving if so this in itself is an improvement over past attitudes or it may be that white people feel that in a darkened theatre other white people will not know they are sitting next to negroes having been reared in georgia i know that most southern people do not feel any strangeness or repugnance in associating intimately with negro people so long as either no other white person is watching or the association is on an obviously paternalistic level or perhaps racial prejudice is simply less strong among the moviegoing public than among baseball fans racial attitudes are certainly changing rapidly in america so much so that within a few generations no one will speak of the future of the american negro for the simple reason that there will be no such thing as an american negro miscegenation legal and illegal and past present and future will take care of color lines although not of class and economic prejudices it is only a matter of time until underprivileged segregationists and lower class negroes join forces for their mutual interests in the meanwhile however all american people have to live together in a present which is shaping the future sometimes i get impatient with endless and aimless liberal talk that is often irresponsible and appears to do as much harm as good this talk nevertheless does indicate a degree of interest and concern out of such talk there will eventually evolve attitudes and actions which will permanently alter our american society it has been my observation through years as a minister in particular and an observer of the american scene in general that church people are very much like the rest of the populace in the churches i have served as in the political arena it is always the liberals who dream the dreams and force the conservatives out of their complacency but when the dreams have to be translated into reality the liberals seldom have the stability and knowhow to get the job done i have learned from experience that almost always it is the dissatisfied or even neurotic element which stirs things up and then depends on the conservative and usually more stable group to sift the good ideas from the bad and make them work without the liberals the status quo almost always gets more and more smug and lifeless but without the conservatives worthwhile dreams often turn into nightmares of inefficiency and rebellion serving merely as a vent for frustration since church people on the whole are politically and socially at least as conservative as the general population the present church support of the civil_rights movement indicates that the battle for civil_rights for negroes has been won only the translation of this new mood into effective political and social action remains to be fully implemented now a new and much more complicated battle has to be fought to eliminate or to reduce paternalism there are few white americans who are not guilty of paternalistic attitudes toward negroes even if these attitudes are not selfrecognizable or apparent to casual observers i have long prided myself on having liberal racial attitudes articles i have written speeches i have made sermons i have preached and actions i have taken in behalf of negro people have at times brought distress to my family but it is only during the past few months that i have begun to see within myself racial prejudices which i thought had disappeared years ago perhaps a better title for this present article might well be confessions of a white paternalist i remember vividly back in the middle s when as a teenager i was the only pupil in a large church school class to vote in favor of a proposed interracial meeting to be held at our church but standing up for the dignity and rights of others does not necessarily guarantee that one does not carry within himself subtle paternalistic attitudes which are all tooapparent to sensitive negro people subtle racial paternalism is a necessary phase in social change which america must now endure as it earlier endured slavery near slavery and open paternalism but the phase can be considerably shortened and less damaging if white americans will take a good look at themselves in the attempt to ferret out both their conscious and subconscious paternalistic attitudes i see no logical reason why white americans consciously seeking better racial attitudes should feel guilty because our fathers have eaten sour grapes and have set our teeth on edge we are not responsible for the sins of our fathers although we may be responsible for the prejudices of our children one simply cannot be brought up in a society where a minority group has consistently been exploited ridiculed and degraded without coming to feel emotionally if not rationally that such people have to be treated differently from other peoplethe worst of us employing harshness and force and the best of us thinking of negroes as somewhat like children even if our actions to them are kind and just much of white criticism for some present negro actions and i include myself among these white critics may well include the attitude of a father to a rebellious teenager whom the father knows has to rebel in order to grow nevertheless the father also resents his loss of control over the son in time a rebellious son grows up and has a mature meaningful relationship to the father if the latter has been loving wise and emotionally mature enough himself to let his son be his own man even while giving the support every boy needs from his father the above analogy is very common indeed among white people the racial attitude of the late dr albert schweitzer furnishing a conspicuous examplebut the analogy is not justified because negro adults are not children and they rightly resent being treated as such even if one excludes such ridiculous fantasies as an ignorant white backwoodsman thinking that he is a better man than a ralph bunche although the chances are that the former has never even heard of the latter there is still within most white people an emotional feeling that negroes are not really equal to white peoplea feeling inevitably imposed by past american political social cultural educational and economic conditions negro people to some degree have accepted subconsciously if not consciously the white mans judgment concerning their alleged inferiority even among negroes a lighter skin has been generally judged to be superior white values have been prized and sought paternalism reveals itself in many ways for example only in recent years have i learned not to speak with individual negroes concerning race if they themselves initiate such discussion i of course participate openly but otherwise i do not even at the risk of some negro and white people assuming especially since i am a native southerner that i am racially prejudiced in the long run such simple acceptance of people as they are without mention of race will do more to eliminate paternalism than unlimited and embarrassing protestations of racial brotherhood by white people to negroes i have often sung for civic and church groups the most popular selection and the one i did best was a version of shortnin bread complete with a negro dialect borrowed from versions by lawrence tibbitt and lansing hatfield with additions of my own another favorite was water boy a song made vivid to me by my boyhood recollections of watching negro convicts work and sing but both songs present certain negro stereotypes in an affectionate but nevertheless paternalistic way to be sure i never sang either of these songs without following with op man river some years ago however my conscience began to bother me about singing these songs as i became more sensitive to negro feelings with great reluctance i decided never to sing these songs again until such time as these stereotypes no longer exist or negro and white people can accept these songs as folk music and folklore without traumaan evolvement not likely to take place in this generation paternalism exists in many forms both recognized and unrecognized within almost all american white people all of these forms must diligently be searched for and eliminated from the lives of all white men if the era of subtle paternalism is to be transcended as the last great barrier separating human beings and degrading all whom it touches west indian partisans in the fight for by john henrik clarke est indians have been coming to the united states for over a century the part they have played in the progress of the afroamericans in their long march from slavery to freedom has always been an important factor more important is the fact that the most outstanding of these caribbeanamericans saw their plight and the plight of the afroamerican as being one and the same as early as a jamaican john b russwurm one of the founders of liberia was the first colored man to be graduated from an american college and to publish a newspaper in this country sixteen years later his fellow countryman peter ogden organized in new york city the first oddfellows lodge for negroes prior to the civil war west indian contribution to the progress of the afroamerican life was one of the main contributing factors in the fight for freedom and full citizenship in the northern part of the united states in his book souls of black folk dr w e b du bois says that the west indians were mainly responsible for the manhood program presented by the race in the early decades of the last century indicative of their tendency to blaze new paths is the achievement of john w a shaw of antigua who in the early s of the last century passed the civil service tests and became deputy commissioner of taxes for the county of queens in new york state in th century america two of the most outstanding fighters for liberty and justice were the west indiansprince hall and john b russwurm when prince hall came to the united states the nation was in turmoil the colonies were ablaze with indignation britain with a series of revenue acts had stoked the fires of colonial discontent in virginia patrick henry was speaking of liberty or death the cry no taxation without representation played on the nerve strings of the nation prince hall then a delicatelooking teenager often walked through the turbulent streets of boston an observer unobserved a few months before these hectic scenes he had arrived in the united states from his home in barbados where he had been born about the son of an englishman and a free african woman he was in theory a free man but he knew that neither in boston nor in barbados were persons of african descent free in fact at once he questioned the sincerity of the vocal white patriots of boston it never seemed to have occurred to them that the announced principles motivating their action was stronger argument in favor of destroying the system of slavery the colonists held in servitude more than a half million human beings some of them white yet they engaged in the contradiction of going to war to support the theory that all men were created equal when prince hall arrived in boston that city was the center of the american slave trade most of the major leaders of revolutionary movement in fact were slaveholders or investors in slavesupported businesses hall like many other americans wondered what did these men mean by freedom the condition of the free black men as prince hall found them was not an enviable one emancipation brought neither freedom nor relief from the stigma of color they were free in name only they were still included with slaves indentured servants and indians in the slave codes discriminatory laws severely circumscribed their freedom of movement by prince hall saw little change in the condition of the blacks and though a freeman at least in theory he saw his people debased as though they were slaves still in bondage these things drove him to prepare himself for leader ship among his people so through diligence and frugality he became a property owner thus establishing himself in the eyes of white people as well as the blacks but the ownership of property was not enough he still had to endure sneers and insults he decided then to prepare himself for a role of leadership among his people to this end he went to school at night and later became a methodist preacher his church became the forum for his peoples grievances ten years after his arrival in boston massachusetts he was the accepted leader of the black community in hall petitioned the massachusetts legislature protesting the kidnapping of free negroes this was a time when american patriots were engaged in a constitutional struggle for freedom they had proclaimed the inherent rights of all mankind to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hall dared to remind them that the black men in the united states were human beings and as such were entitled to freedom and respect for their human personality prejudice made hall the father of african secret societies in the united states he is the father of what is now known as negro mas onry hall first sought initiation into the white masonic lodge in boston but was turned down because of his color he then applied to the army lodge of an irish regiment his petition was favorably received on march hall and fourteen other black americans were initiated in lodge number when on march the british were forced to evacuate boston the army lodge gave prince hall and his colleagues a license to meet and function as a lodge thus on july african lodge no came into being this was the first lodge in masonry established in america for men of african descent the founding of the african lodge was one of prince halls greatest achievements it afforded the africans in the new england area of the united states a greater sense of security and contributed to a new spirit of unity among them halls interest did not end with the lodge he was deeply concerned with improving the lot of his people in other ways he sought to have schools established for the children of the free africans in massachusetts of prime importance is the fact that prince hall worked to secure respect for the personality of his people and also played a significant role in the downfall of the massachusetts slave trade he helped to prepare the groundwork for the freedom fighters of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose continuing efforts have brought the black american closer to the goal of full citizenship in his series of articles entitled pioneers in protest lerone bennett senior editor of ebony magazine has written a capsule biography of john b russworm the distinguished west indian who was a pioneer in afroamerican journalism the following information has been extracted from his article founders of the negro press ebony magazine july day in and day out the negroes of new york city were mercilessly lampooned in the white press in the dying days of the campaign of vilification and slander reached nauseous heights the integrity and courage of negro men were openly questioned worse editors invaded negro homes and impugned the chastity of negro women this was a time of acute crisis for all negro americans and the new york leaders were agonizingly conscious of the forces arrayed against them more ominous was the creeping power of the american colonization society which wanted to send free negroes back to africa john b russwurm and samuel e cornish two of the youngest and most promising of the new york leaders were assigned the task of inventing a journal that could speak forcibly to both the enemy and joint friend without and the brethren within the veil samuel e cornish who is virtually unknown today was born about in delaware and raised in relatively free environments of philadelphia and new york he organized the first negro presbyterian church in new york city russworm who is generally credited with being the first negrograduate of an american college was a jamaican the son of an englishman and an african woman his father neglected to inform his white wife of the sins of his youth but after his death the widow learned of his existence and financed his education at bowdoin college where he was graduated in russwurm and cornish made an excellent team despite the difference in their backgrounds in the prospectus for the proposed paper they idealistically stated we shall ever regard the constitution of the united states as our polar star pledged to no party we shall endeavor to urge our brethren to use their rights to the elective franchise as free citizens it shall never be our objective to court controversy though we must at all times consider ourselves as champions in defense of oppressed humanity daily slandered we think that there ought to be some channel of communication between us and the public through which a single voice may be heard in defense of five hundred thousand free people of color on friday march the first issue of freedoms journal the first negro newspaper in the western world appeared on the streets of new york city in their ambitious first editorial russwurm and cornish struck a high note of positiveness that still has something to say to the afroamericans in their present plight it read in part we wish to plead our own cause too long have others spoke for us too long has the republic been deceived by misrepresentations in things which concern us dearly though in the estimation of some mere trifles for though there are many in society who exercise toward us benevolent feelings still with sorrow we confess it there are others who make it their business to enlarge upon the least trifle which tends to discredit any person of color and pronounce anathema and denounce our whole body for the misconduct of this guilty one our vices and our degradation are ever arrayed against us but our virtues are passed unnoticed it is our earnest wish the first editorial of the first negro newspaper said to make our journal a medium of intercourse between our brethren in different states of this great confederacy the timeliness of this editorial written over a hundred years ago and the dynamics of its intellectual content is far ahead of most editorials that appear in presentday afroamerican newspapers during the later years of his life john b russwurm moved to a position that today would be called black nationalism after receiving his masters degree from bowdoin college in russwurm went to liberia in west africa where he established another newspaper the liberia herald and served as superintendent of schools after further distinguishing himself as the governor of the maryland colony of cape palmas this pioneer editor and freedom fighter died in liberia in the same year john b russwurm died another west indian edward w blyden went to africa and established himself in liberia he was destined to become the greatest black intellectual of the th century he concerned himself with the plight of african people the world over and eventually built a bridge of understanding between the people of african origin in the west indies the united states and in africa more than anyone else in the th and during the early part of the th century edward w blyden called upon the black man to reclaim himself and his ancient african glory the concept now being called negritude started with blyden blyden was born in the then danish west indian island of st thomas in but reacted against treatment of his people in the new world by emigrating to liberia in he was convinced that the only way to bring respect and dignity to the people of african descent was by building progressive new empires in africa whose civilization while remaining basically african would incorporate useful elements of western culture it was the great edward w blyden who with the immortal frederick douglass placed before the bar of public opinion in england and other countries in europe the case of the black man in america as far back as the renowned scholar and benefactor of west africa dr edward wilmot blyden speaking on the occasion of his inauguration as president of liberia college sounded the note for the organized teaching of the culture and civilization of africa and decried the fact that the worlds image of africa was not in keeping with africas true status in world history i quote from his address on this occasion the people generally are not yet prepared to understand their own interests in the great work to be done for themselves and their children we shall be obliged to work for some time to come not only without the popular sympathy we ought to have but with utterly inadequate resources in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary books geographies travels histories having embraced or at least assented to these falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes and whatever his literary attainments or acquired ability he fancies that he must grind at the mill which is provided for him putting in material furnished to his hands bringing no contribution from his own field and of course nothing comes out but what is put in blyden made several trips to the united states and to his former home in the west indies with the gold coast nationalist j e casely hayford blyden developed the idea of a federation of west african states he died in of all the west indians who influenced the afroamerican freedom struggle the most colorful and the most controversial was marcus aurelius garvey among the numerous black manassehs who presented themselves and their grandiose programs to the people of harlem marcus garvey was singularly unique he was born in jamaica in the grandson of an african slavea fact that was his proudest boast he had grown up under a threeway color system white mulatto and black garveys reaction to color prejudice and his search for a way to rise above it and lead his people back to africa spiritually if not physically was the allconsuming passion of his existence marcus garveys glorious romantic and riotous movement exhorted the black race and fixed their eyes on the bright star of a future in which they would reclaim and rebuild their african homeland and heritage garvey came to the united states as a disciple of booker t washington founder of tuskegee institute unfortunately booker t washington died before marcus garvey reached this coun try garvey had planned to raise funds and return to jamaica to establish an institution similar to tuskegee in he had organized the universal negro improvement association in jamaica after the failure of this organization he looked to the united states where he found a loyal group of followers willing to listen to his message garvey succeeded in building a mass movement among american negroes while other leaders were attempting it and doubting that it could be done he advocated the return of africa to the africans and people of african descent he organized very rashly and incompetently the black star line a steamship company for transporting people of african descent from the united states to africa garvey and his movement had a short and spectacular life span in the united states his movement took really effective form in about and by he was in a federal prison charged with misusing the mails from prison he was deported home to jamaica this is briefly the essence of the garvey saga the selfproclaimed provisional president of africa never set foot on african soil he spoke no african language but garvey managed to convey to members of the black race everywhere and to the rest of the world his passionate belief that africa was the home of a civilization which had once been great and would be great again when one takes into consideration the slenderness of garveys resources and the vast material forces social conceptions and imperial interests which automatically sought to destroy him his achievement remains one of the great propaganda miracles of this country the deportation of marcus garvey and the decline of his movement marked the end of an era an era when west indians and afroamericans worked together and saw their plight as one and the same in spite of the contributions that west indians continued to make to the afroamerican freedom struggle the relations between these two basically african people deteriorated there are indications that the present freedom struggle in africa the caribbean area and in the united states will become the basis for a new era of understanding and cooperation foreign investments a boon to africa by a okonkwo nwani any writers on economic development have asserted that one of the causes for the low level of industrial output or absence of industrialism in african countries is the lack of capital and little or no investment domestically or internally to industrialize therefore foreign investments become very necessary and act as the agent or conveyor of progress this article is intended to dispel this timehonored notion and affirm that african countries should not depend upon foreign investment for industrialization since the investments from abroad have negative and destabilizing effects on the social stability of african countries foreign investments have their political economic and religious or ideological riders attached i will not be concerned with statistics in this paper to avoid unnecessary details but will only consider the question if african countries should industrialize without foreign investments from where will the funds for industrialization come to answer such a question a distinction should be made in the term economic surplus which is used for investment actual economic surplus is the difference between the societys actual current output and its actual current consumption it is identical with current saving or accumulation and finds its embodiment in assets of various kinds added to societys wealth during the period in question ie productive facilities and equipment inventories foreign balances and gold hoards actual economic surplus has been generated in all socioeconomic formations and while its size and structure have markedly differed from one phase of development to another its existence has characterized nearly all of mans history in africa this is equally true the magnitude of the actual economic surplus which is savings or capital formation is at least conceptually readily established and today is regularly estimated by statistical agencies in most countries the difficulties that are encountered in its measurement are merely technical which in the case of african countries is a case for organization lack of adequate statistical agencies is neither identical with nor synonymous with the lack of savings of a high magnitude another aspect that one has to consider is potential economic surplus ie the difference between the output that could be produced in a given natural technological environment with the help of employable productive resources and what might be regarded as essential consumption its realization presupposes a more or less drastic reorganization of the production and distribution of social output and implies farreaching changes in the structure of the society the potential economic surplus can be classified under four headings the societys excess consumption on the part of the upper income groups the output lost to society through the existence of unproductive workers the output lost due to irrational and wasteful organization of the existing productive apparatus the output foregone due to the existence of unemployment caused primarily by the anarchy of foreign production systems and ideology and the deficiency of effective demand correcting these shortcomings generated by the colonial system as they are in african countries the potential economic surplus would be undoubtedly realized as actual economic surplus which could be channelled into investment uses in most if not all african countries the shortage of capital does not exist as it seems to appear in most writings on industrially developing african countries the potential economic surplus that could be made available for such investment is large in all of them it is not large in absolute magnitudes as we deal with in highly industrialized countries such as the united states and great britain leaving the idea of the presence of sufficient internal capital for industrialization i will examine the types of foreign investments made in african countries a survey of the major private investments in africa shows that they were concentrated in the agricultural and extractive industries little or no investment was made in manufacture in all areas of africa where foreign investment has been made one fact stands out clearly the suppression of the inalienable rights of africans foreign investments foreign investments in africa have been praised as having been made with the primary reason of supplying the necessary capital for africas industrialization about per cent of such investments were concentrated in mining the principal areas are as follows mining south africa diamonds manganese gold and uranium libya petroleum zambia copper algeria petroleum congo republic copper cobalt diamonds and uranium angola copper cadmium zinc and diamonds ghana bauxite gold manganese nigeria tin petroleum gold sierra leone diamonds manganese southern rhodesia copper egypt uar phosphate iron ore liberia bauxite diamonds ethiopia petroleum s w africa copper diamonds uranium agriculture south africa wool liberia rubber ghana cocoa nigeria palm products rubber ethiopia coffee tanzannia sisal kenya coffee uganda coffee algeria citrus sudan cotton cameroon bananas mozambique tobacco southern rhodesia tobacco what are the social consequences of these foreign investments in these areas how do these investments as development schemes look to african eyes who benefits from them who pays for them what are the already apparent and probable future consequences of these schemes the answers to these questions will to some degree bring out the social impact of foreign investments in africa let us start with the mining interests in the preforeign investment period the peoples of africa owned their mines beneath the surface of their lands centuries before the advent of europeans in africa they mined such minerals as iron copper and tin they utilized these minerals in the local manufacture of their weapons for battle their agricultural implements their household wares and used bronze in works of art an outstanding example is the bronze work of benin which attracted the portuguese merchants to west africa the rich copper deposits of central africa now the property of belgian british and american corporations were originally owned and worked by africans in the present messina district of the northern transvaal south africa the bavenda carried on extensive shaftmining and smelting of copper ore in southwest africa copper ore was mined by the herero and was carried northward from tsumeb to ondangua to be smelted and worked by the ovambo coppersmiths today the tsumeb mines are owned by new york corporations and the herero and ovambo are brought to the mines to work as unskilled labourers the investments in mining by europeans and americans was the first step of conquest then followed the building of roads railroads capital importation and the promotion of european migration to the main areas of investment the final step in this process in the aftermath of world war ii has been aimed at carrying on the economic conquest in the form of foreign aid to complete systemize and accelerate the extraction of the continents resources the various governments added to the investments while the united states assumed the role of general overseer the investments made by foreign corporations and even governments were made for a definite goalprofits from and subjugation of the africans in africa ments in the whole of africa foreign investment was the principal cause for the concentration of european settlements in african countries there was the lure of diamonds and gold in south africa leading from there into rhodesia and southwest africa there were the attractions of the beautiful high plateau country in kenya and southern angola there were governmentsponsored settlement schemes for strategic or economic objectives to tackle the main questions asked earlier a few specific areas will be discussed now in almost all african countries the land was regarded as common property of the group the family clan tribe or nation land tenure is based on three cardinal principles that the land ultimately belongs to the community and cannot be alienated from it without its consent that within the community the individual shall have security of tenure for the land he requires for grazing his cattle his gardens his farms and that no member of the community shall be without land the land still remains the basis of life for the great majority of the people of africa including the most industrialized sections of the continent the old security of land tenure met its doom with the influx of foreign investment and european settlement in algeria south africa kenya rhodesia and mozambique it was the same story over and over again the original inhabitants were pushed back by the forces of foreign investment and by the newcomers who took the choicest areas for themselves and marked off what they did not require of what land was left for the exclusive habitation of the africans large areas were sequestered against future contingencies or out of sheer greedy speculation in kenya for example in europeans were in possession of acres of land of which only acres were under cultivation while some or more kikuyus were crowded into a reserve measuring acres the belgians in the congo and the french in equatorial and west africa usurped and allocated land for settlement or concession without regard to the legal rights of the original owners in south africa the story was much more gloomy in the interest of development with foreign investments people were driven off the land into restricted areas with the primary objective of forcing them to work outside the land available to them land alienation transformed selfsupporting farmers into squatter tenant farmers or migrant labourers on the settlers farms or drove them to the mines and cities in search of work furthermore where the land was taken or where it was not a tax was levied on every male african who appeared to have reached his sixteenth or eighteenth birthday settlers became liable for taxation when twentyone such taxation reinforced by automatic fines or imprisonment per cent of the tax or two months in jail in malawi nyasaland as an exampleserved effectively in increasing the labour supply to conclude the social evil of foreign investment in agriculture a comparison between the africancontrolled and settlercontrolled agriculturalsystem follows the wealth of west african colonies is largely due to the fact that they are cultivated by the people of the soil working in their own interests it is not an accident that colonies where the land remains in african hands pay their way where the land is given to settlers agriculture has to be subsidized in one way or another even in south africa the white farmer will not do a mans job and farming there survives by the crushing exploitation of the african and by differential taxation and special concessions on the railway which have to be paid by other users a careful examination of this will clearly show the problems of surplus raised earlier investment in mining in the bible we read god so loved the world that he gave his only son to redeem man on earth can we say that foreign investors so loved africans and the african quest for industrialization as to pour large sums of investible funds into the african continent directly i will say that was not the case profits by exploitation was the motivating force which pushed the bloated silkhatted couponclipping financiers to invest in africa a few remarks about mining in some african countries will be appropriate at this point european mining in south africa began about the total amount of recorded sales of diamonds and gold in the union of south africa through is billion this amount of monetary value was derived from tons of gold and over tons of diamonds the various minerals are itemized as follows value realized from minerals recorded sales through million gold diamonds coal asbestos copper uranium manganese chrome iron ore the amount calculated in the table was the value at the time they were sold if we were to use current prices it would come to over billion in zambia northern rhodesia the value of copper sold was billion in southern rhodesia the gold asbestos coal chrome and tungsten marketed brought a revenue of million between and and in million in the belgian congo now congo leopoldville the european mining of gold began in copper in diamonds and tin in later cobalt and manganese started to play a vital role in mineral exports if we neglect the value of undisclosed and substantial amounts of uranium and other fissionable materials exported the value comes to million annually between and the northeastern corner of angola has been aptly called a diamond country there the diamond company of angola has been called portugals most notable private enterprise in terms of its revenues perhaps yes but the social policies directed against the africans are atrociously criminal more than carats of diamonds were exported in alone this very company claims the distinction of having the lowest paid mine workers to be found anywhere in africa in over of its african employees were forced workers supplied by intervention of the authorities backed by the international bandits and conspirators these mine workers in angola were paid a month the net profits of the company for alone was and combined profits for and were per cent over the total of invested capital in the director of geological survey in ghana then gold coast reported that the value of the minerals extracted by the british from the colony since was million early in the th century the british dutch and danes were sending home gold to the value of annually today the ashanti goldfield corporation makes a profit of million from gold alone annually diamonds manganese and even agricultural produce are not accounted for in nigeria tons of tin ore worth million was exported between and in sierra leone between and more than million tons of diamonds from the marampa plain were exported in alone tons were exported an account of all these mining ventures has one factor in common mining rights were illegally acquired through deceit and conspiracy thus highly diabolical and iniquitous the investments from abroad were mainly in equipment royalties paid if any were very little the apparent lack of capital for current industrialization is due in a large measure to the drain of the mineral wealth of africa by foreign investment it is a serious charge to makethat the wealth of africa is drained away minerals are one of africas precious assets yet the mines are almost always operated by european capitalist companies which pay dividends to their overseas shareholders heavy remuneration to their directors as likely as not the lions share of their taxes to the british exchequer royalties to venerable but functionless companies and enormous wages to local european employees what remains for the african workers and for the african exchequers are the crumbs from the rich mans table so writes dr rita hinden in the challenge of african poverty anybody who could put himself in the position of the african will definitely come to the same answer as an african would without my spelling it out foreign investment in my own appraisal has been a handicap an impediment and a liability to the industrialization of africa investments in agriculture and mining have not led to manufacturing of any kind by the very corporations operating there in all areas whether occupied by settlers or not only the negative aspects of foreign investments dominated the scene justice freedom and individualism have been grossly subverted and destroyed how many lives have been lost in africa how many are still dying today anyone vitally interested should check the events in all of africathe whole of africa and the slave trade algeria and the french kenya the rhodesias and the british union of south africa cum united states of america visavis africans belgium and the congo in all these places we can talk eloquently about liberty and freedom and about human rights and fundamental freedoms and about dignity and worth of the human personality but most of our vocabulary derives from a period when our society was individualistic consequently it has little meaning to those who live under conditions where individualism means premature deaths the africans point of view is that foreign investment is primarily interested in profits uranium and other minerals should never come before people people and their freedoms should always in all places and at all times come first unfortunately the credo of foreign investment is minerals loot and plunder profits and complete annihilation of the africans at this stage of the twentieth century foreign investment channelled through the subsidiaries of the corporations in the metropolitan centers of the world have not only affected the governments of african countries but also have affected the internal politics by sheer force of economic circumstances which appears to be unavoidable the corporate operations directly affect the amount of foreign exchange brought into or taken from an african country in the small countries foreign investments have materially affected the position of the domestic currency the expansion of corporate activities also have affected the level of employment its wage policies have had a direct effect on the wage level the adverse effect of this has been the weakening of the government in power and the strengthening of the opposition in some countries the corporations have espoused the strengthening of inhumane practices perpetrated against the africans typical examples are the union of south africa and apartheid southern rhodesia and the dictatorship of the minority over the majority not only have foreign investments increased instability in the past currently or in this decade all the military coups have been planned and executed with the cooperation of local agents without belaboring this issue the practices of oil companies in places like nigeria algeria and libya have had their social destabilizing effects one may ask why no mention was made of the positive contributions of foreign investments i am well aware of such but the negative effects far outstrip the positive effects what the future will be i do not know emphatically it seems to me that reliance on foreign investment for africas industrialization is a pure case of delusion and postponement of what should be done corrective steps should be taken new policies should be devised so that the

ne of the first and most significant collections of afroamerican poetry the poetry of the negro edited by arna bontemps and langston hughes was published in for more than a decade this book was practically the onlyalthough a very richsource for the study and enjoyment of that vast body of poets whose race prevented them from taking welldeserved seats among their paler colleagues in the united states the poetry of the negro contains poems written between and by american poets of african descent eight of these poems are by one robert e hayden letter from the south a photograph of isadora duncan runagate runagate o daedalus fly away home homage to the empress of the blues eine kleine nachtmusik frederick douglass and a ballad of remembrance it took until the year when enterprising young dutchman paul breman a londoner by choice saw the quality and the importance of haydens writing to put a representative collection of his work before the public the publisher gave this book the name of a yearold poem and included five of the pieces from the anthology the poetry of the negro daedalus empress of the blues nachtmusik frederick douglass and that astonishingly contemporary poem a ballad of remembrance publishers or editors cannot just pick the poems they themselves like for a book they are about to publish there may and should be a dialogue between editor and poet but the creator of the work has of course the last word it is therefore remarkable that robert hayden who is one of his own works severest and most pitiless critics wanted these five poems of at least fifteen years ago to go into his london published volume that title poem is perhaps the most striking example of the total of robert haydens characteristics creativeness of image and language never obscure never out to baffle the reader always wanting to reach out to communicate are among the strongest and most valuable of these in his a ballad of remembrance quadroon mermaids afro angels black saints balanced upon the switchblades of that air and sang every time i read the ballad when i read it just with my eyes hearing the echo of the words singing inside me or when i read it aloud to make it communicate with people in an attempt to open their minds and ears to the voice of a true poet whenever or wherever i make contact with that ballad of remembrance i envy mark van doren to whom hayden addresses himself and therefore this is not only a ballad of remembrance but also mark van doren a poem of remembrance a gift a souvenir for you in that way every poets poem is a gift a souvenir to everyone who approaches it and robert hayden is one of the afroamerican poets whose precious gifts have far too long lain unheeded hayden is certainly not a protest poet in the usual sense of the word he would refuse that label as he refuses to be pigeonholed as a negro poet or as one whose negritude or raceidentification features as a basic quality of his poetry and still he is all that not primarily not deliberately not in prepense but naturally all that in him is truly instinct brainmatter diastole systole reflex action as he himself speaks of freedom and liberty as personified in the great frederick douglass at dakar as a member of the grand jury for the literature prizes and before the festival in the preselection jury in paris and london my colleagues and i tried to recognize the qualities of true poetry originality creativeness disciplined inspiration craftsmanship in the handling of the raw material namely the language ability to communicate the ability to sing via the printed word into the heart and mind of a reader on the great prizegiving night our jurychairman langston hughes proudly announced that robert e hayden of the united states was our poet laureate and that honorary mentions were given to derek walcott of the west indian island of st lucia for his book in a green night and to christopher okigbo of nigeria for his collection of poetry limits it had been a difficult choice still the jury thought that haydens work deserved the ultimate honor which could be awarded to a book of poetry published between january and september which has not received any other prizes or distinctions in during a visit at fisk i read robert haydens poem runagate at a meeting in which the poet was present runagate a dramatic poem about my private hero harriet tubman had been a favorite of mine for years in i was preparing my book i am the new negro a book in which i attempt to show through poems songs and documents the american negros own active yearslong freedom fight i asked hayden for permission to include runagate and got a completely new version and a letter from which i quote enclosed is the new version of runagate and i hope that it wont be too much of a trial you may not agree with me but i think its much better in places than the earlier one i should tell you this too it was your reading of runagate that night at the center which sent me back to the poem i hadnt looked at it for years had put it aside as another of my many failures hearing it i realized that it was not so bad as id thought i am asking the editors of negro digest to print both versions of runagate compare them see how painstakingly a conscientious poet works how he succeeds after years in stripping all sentimentality and extra dramatic effect from a piece and in giving it the ring of truth of clearer honesty give an hour of your time to a comparison of those two versions of the same poem and undergo the blessings of a true poets craftsmanship and of his sincere wish to impress and communicate through naked truth handled with an artists skill now that the dice have fallen feel justified in revealing the essence of the report concerning a ballad of remembrance issued by the preselection jury for the anglophone literary prizes in order to facilitate the work of the grand jury at dakar a ballad of remembrance consists of four sections four acts of a drama or four symphonic movements or the four seasons hayden is a remarkable craftsman a striking singer of words his extraordinary talent makes itself known in almost every line from the first quadroon mermaids afroangels black saints of the title poem to the thunderous final bars of his poem to frederick douglass when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful and terrible thing hayden writes about the land of his birth redbuds like momentary trees of an illusionist while in tour he tells of static villages whose names are all thats left of choctaw chickasaw children worldless and remote one moment we are on a road in kentucky or the coast of maine then we are facing bessie smith who shone that smile on us and put the lights to shame and sang in witch doctor africa melts into america africa shines through an elks parade too when jack johnson in his limousine made all the arid ghetto bloom with fantasies of ethiopia the third part of the book presents haydens remembrance of mexico descriptive passionate detached involved alienated all the dark the light the joy the pain the fourth part of the ballad probes deepest in a newfound idiom sounds and images deeply linked with visual impressions apotheosis and coda are the ballad of nat turner for the wheel in a turning wheel which is time in eternity had ceased its whirling and owl and moccassin panther and nameless beast and i were held like creatures fixed in flaming in fiery amber the last drumbeat then is for frederick douglass the preselection jury ranks robert haydens poetry with the best anglophone contemporary writing they recommend a ballad of remembrance most emphatically to the attention of the grand jury and to poet and friend robert hayden i want to say this at dakar the words negro and negritude negroness took on new meaning and new dignity negro means no more nor less than black african or of african descent without any emotional overtones negritude took on the meaning of unconditional acceptance of ones own individual self without any sense of inferiority or superiority it also refers to the awareness of certain aspects of group experiences in that respect i in my blanchitude can fully accept my negritude robert hayden belongs to the bahai world faith bahai is belief in the unity of all religions of all prophets in light half nightmare and half vision he speaks of the face of bahaullah prophet of the bahai faith in whose eyes hayden sees the suffering of the men and women who died at dachau and buchenwald for their specific negritude bahais believe in the unity of all mankind the universality of all of gods creation in haydens poem the prophet he speaks of the auroral darkness which is god and he sees energies like angels dance glorias of recognition they too sense their groupawareness and so the first world festival of negro arts has honoured an afroamericans artistic parity his natural negroness which is part of his natural humanness his americanness along with his universalness the human integrity of an artist and the artistic integrity of a fellowman writers converge at fisk university by david llorens springs fragrance filled the air friday evening april as writers civil_rights workers educators and students converged on the campus of fisk university in nashville to discuss the image of negro in american literature gathered in historical jubilee hall the nations oldest building of higher education for negroes reminded that the late w e b dubois passed this route while developing his genius an audience of about persons eagerly anticipated the opening remarks and the promise of a stimulating weekend for too long weve looked into the eyes of the white master for an image of ourselves and with those words john oliver killens authorinresidence at fisk and director of the conference issued the challenge that would provide excitement anger joy and intense probing until the closing address two days later by ossie davis novelistessayist saunders redding keynoting the conference noted that the negro writers situation has never been good and earned the audiences favor as he spoke of the american negro having been imprisoned in the culture and social assumption of the western worldusually held in derision or contempt scholarly somewhat military in bearing redding observed that honest writers seek ultimately to discover the human condition he cited the value of negritude calling it a relatively inexplicable mystique and drew a loud burst of applause with his suggestion that the literary mainstream resembles a sewer redding quoted expatriate novelist julian mayfields admonition that it would be better for the black writer to remain silent than accept the shoddy literary values of white america but for those who entertained the idea of a writers conference without provocation or controversy the keynote address proved the contrary preoccupation with repossessing a heritage has led to distortion of values and reality in some cases said redding in a preface to accusing some negro writers of making heroes out of heels in their fiction on the receiving end of his charge were john a williams night song chester himes if he hollers let him go rosa guy bird in my window and james baldwin another country there were those who subscribed to the distinguished professors accusations but it was noteworthy that the lone applause was delivered by bert gilden coauthor with his wife katya of the novel hurry sundown a conference participant who would later provide insight into his enthusiasm over the put down of baldwin to paraphrase redding baldwin created a characterrufus who failed to engage the sympathy intended by the author the ensuing question and answer session found various baldwinian sensibilities ruffled including that of a most unusual clergyman father james woodruff episcopal chaplain at fisk someone mistook him for white at the start but by sunday night everyone knew he was indeed black who was in no way inhibited by his collar woodruff and a conservatively bearded young man pressed the issue of heroes and heels but redding muscles tensed overpowered his adversaries with the plea oh lord i dont want to argue however the ingredients for battle had reached surface and tomorrow would be another day the novel and its social relevance to the negro revolution was the subject of saturdays opening panel discussion bert gilden john o killens and margaret halsey author of with malice toward some and the pseudoethic were the panelists once more the memory of dubois prevailed as killens recalled dubois prophecy that the problem of the twentieth century is the color line and that the future of the world would be what colored men make it folksy and peopleoriented whether talking or writing the author of black mans burden insisted that we black folk inhale tragedy with each breath we take according to killens civilized as applied to black people in white western culture is a euphemism for enslaved allowing that all propaganda is not art killens contended that all art is propaganda he asked when are you writers going to define some terms like integration liberalism nonviolence nationalism freedom and civil_rights there was laughter at his observation that most americans suffer from an edifice complex but mr killens was quite serious chuck has never listened to black writers unless they said what he wanted to hear the negro revolt is part and parcel of a worldwide revolution our literature should have social relevance to the world struggle and especially to the struggle of black americans killens cited the black artists responsibility for debrainwashing he then told of a session with a group of civil_rights workers that convinced him of the necessity for social relevance in literature the appearance later saturday evening of then sncc executive secretary james forman subsequently provided impetus for the conference authors halsey and gilden agreed that literature should have relevance to the social revolution but they were equally sensitive to certain hazards and limitations involved gilden charged novelists with the responsibility to present negroes without distortion as full fledged characters and was especially vehement in his appeal god forbid politics or social convictions influencing the work of the writer miss halsey warned that despair is inverted energy and contended that the writer must liberate energy although they did not deny that america is a racist society panelists halsey and gilden attributed this for the most part to the ignorance of white americans and miss halsey who was not present for the previous nights session introduced more hero debate this time in the form of sonny liston provoked by those contentions william melvin kelley led the questions which were of course comments as well from the floor fully bearded and sporting dark glasses prompting the question from at least one observer is that leroi jones novelist kelley stood held his notes in front of him and began what would be a very vocal weekend that left more than one observer puzzled my comments are directed at the two white panelists opened kelley you assume white people are ignorant i do not believe this exploitation has been unconscious you know alluding to ignorance as suggested by the two panelists kelley called it part of the liberal mechanismthe cop out it was difficult to believe that the same man who wrote the ivy league negro for esquire magazine a couple of years ago was talking when he explained in detail to miss halsey why sonny liston was a hero to the black cats in watts adding that he liston is not roy wilkins suggesting that the nation is a victim of calvinistic protestantism as he would reiterate all weekend kelley suggested that progress can only be achieved by overthrowing christianity as we know it pressed with regard to his agreement with redding on baldwins character rufus gilden acknowledged his agreement which led to a discussion of exactly what kind of character should engage sympathy a member of the audience accused redding and gilden of basing their conclusions on white western cultures imposed values and concepts of dignity he told them that art was meaningless if artists failed to discover meaningful ways of relating it to the problems of people and asserted that black people might still be oppressed years from now and if your art has not helped them it will be little more than a selfish possessionin fact a part of their exploitation gilden pressed the speaker for an explanation as to the values he was speaking of and asked what he would replace them with the answer was all values relating to economics which are the only ones respected in america must be replaced gilden later told a small group that there was no such thing as selfhatred among negroes which prompted someone to ask if his current novel will include negroes his affirmative response prompted the advice that he not attempt to create a negro character until you find out something about negroes by this time the enormous gap between the way white and black americans view the world was revealing itself both in and out of the official conference sessions the saturday afternoon session treatment of the negro in the novel found william melvin kelley on a panel which included katya gilden and the south african novelist and short story writer richard rive mrs gilden observed the tendency of american novelists to create characters from the dominant group in society and to assume universality she contended that the late richard wright limited his work to terror and helplessness which excluded much of negro life once again there was subtle reference to the hero and heels debate when she accused writers of creating monsters claiming that they are produced by segregation and thereby providing segregationists with material that is used to maintain segregation ie i dont want to live around those kind of people one of the more eloquent presentations of the conference was that of richard rive an engaging man who speaks in lucid british tones and skillfully uses humor his treatise on the use or misuse of the black characters in south african literature was informative his incisive criticism spared none white nor black painfully naive was the label attached to alan patons black characters believing a touch of morality would solve the problem and mr rive noted that the same could be said of many american writers the function of any writer anywhere is to protestprotest the functions of men said rive the best known of contemporary nonwhite south african writers peter abrahams fell into rives category of writers who are busy protesting their status as individuals rather than asserting their right to be the line of protest subscribed to by rive it is noteworthy that leroi jones in an essay written some three years ago made a similar comment on abrahams accusing him of outbaldwinning james with the plea for understanding as an individual a separate entity calling the novel a new art form william melvin kelley attributed the novels appearance to the appearance of the middleclass used to reflect the way they looked at their lives kelley proceeded to condemn capitalism created the middleclass the position relegated woman in the western world the pope renounced evil by renouncing woman and accused white people of trying to make malcolm_x a black beast one who seeks revenge when malcolm according to kelley didnt want to seek the revenge of the black beasthe wanted to rid himself of the white man kelley challenged the black writer to stop writing the protest novel and start writing the revolutionary novel and drew the loudest applause up to that point with his words stop writing imitation white novels to white people and start writing to black people mrs gilden asked if she agreed with kelleys remarks answered yes which begs the question whether or not one can write to black people as kelley suggests successfully while taking care not to create characters that segregationists will use to maintain segregation as suggested by mrs gulden the absence of leroi jones who was invited to the conference was frequently mentioned prior to saturday evenings panel poetry from the negro renaissance till today but the poets on hand while paying tribute to the young bard along the way provided the conferences most stimulating session at the helm were two gentlemen who were not strangers to very many people in the audience arna bontemps and robert hayden and two other poets margaret walker and melvin b tolson who heretofore were strangers to much of the audiencealbeit for quite different reasons margaret walker whose poem for my people written in won the yale prize for poetry has been teaching at jackson state college in jackson mississippi but her silence by no means resulted in her being behind the times as all would soon discover one attends a writers conference anticipating new ideas pertinent criticisms enhanced perspectives a touch of the inexplicable as well as the profoundbut one also secretly hopes for that person who will rise to the occasion and provide the emotional stimulus that transforms writers conferences into good old down home baptist conventionsfor at least a little while that stimulus was provided by melvin b tolson poet laureate of liberia the man described by karl shapiro as the poet who writes in negrowhich then takes us to the reason mr tolson was a stranger to so many in the audience now yearsold m b tolson has been writing poetry since he was twelve and in the meantime has worked at a multitude of occupations that run right through the alphabet including such jobs as stevedore janitor boxer drama director organizer of sharecroppers unions newspaper columnist and fourterm mayor of langston oklahoma the home of langston college where he was for many years a professor the diversity of his life is reflected in both his poetry and talk and the fact that he remains largely unknown according to shapiro is not because he is difficult to read which he is for difficulty of text is the stockintrade of the poetryteaching profession tolson is not read because he is a negro the white professional mind thinks that poetry is written by englishmen or their descendents and imitators nevertheless m b tolson in person shows none of the scars one anticipates from a man whose works were unjustly buried nor does the author of libretto for the republic of liberia rendezvous with america and harlem gallery in his dynamic approach to life and people reveal the effects of two recent serious operations returning to the panel what better choice than arna bontemps one might ask to bring us from those strolling twenties to these searing sixties he was on board all the way like our music our poetry is hard to pin downlikely to be marked with a special riff opened bontemps he remarked that although it followed the english tradition it did not hold it sacred a composed bontemps read poems from the days of the harlem renaissance written by his contemporaries he lauded the current younger poets but found none as precocious as langston hughes paul lawrence dunbar and countee cullen and observed that sterling brown is unsurpassed as a reader of tales the longtime fisk librarians attachment to and admiration for an old friend langston hughes was apparent throughout and along the route he warmly referred to the works of his fellow panelists citing robert haydens a ballad of remembrance published in england in he informed the audience that the book was awarded a prize at the world festival of negro arts which was concluding in dakar senegal in unison with the fisk conference one gets the idea hayden doesnt want to be labeled a negro poet doesnt exactly like that negro thing added bontemps but in his comment there was a touch of compassion and a world of understanding obviously he was speaking of a man he respected he informed the audience of margaret walkers forthcoming novel jubilee the first civil war novel to be written by a negro and said of tolson only recently was he fully recognized observing that racial awareness emerges from almost every line written by tolson allowing that the younger poet is epitomized by the fiery leroi jones bontemps hastened to add that there are others he considers just as important including m carl holman james emmanuel julian bond and dudley randall the detroit bard essayist and short story writer who attended the conference margaret walker capturing her audience with the gleaming brightness of a most friendly smile alluded to the twenties praising jean toomer a sensitive driver james weldon johnson erudite gentlemantalented poet and others of the era the thirties according to miss walker found the black poet brutalized stigmatized and ostracized her presentation included kind words for pulitzer prize winner gwendolyn brooks and the contention that leroi jones dominates the sixties because he has something to say labeling jones the rew inventor miss walker called his language new startling and bold adding that you must read a great deal of jones to really understand him to which saunders redding echoedbut not for all to hear an awful lot i have said this until i almost think ill choke and fall over backwards thus began a visibly disturbed robert hayden addressing himself to the argument as to whether one is a negro poet or as hayden insists a poet who happens to be a negro reading lines from yeats hayden solemnly commented i didnt have to be irish to love those lines lets quit saying were black writers writing to black folksit has been given importance it should not have haydens anticipation of opposition gave way to a slight stutter i dont think were consciously trying to escape his sensibility shaken to the point of anger hayden continued please notice thisall you folks sitting out there waiting to jump down my neck he proceeded to define poetry as the beauty of perception given form the art of saying the impossible the works of gloria oden previously unmentioned were praised by hayden miss oden is the new york poetlawyer who recently reminded negro writers of their privileged status in this republic while reprimanding them for failing to appeal for understanding from a predominantly white audience at last years writers conference at the new school in new york hayden concluded by informing those from whom he expected opposition on the matter of identity if they didnt accept his position baby thats your problem not mine the associate professor of english at fisk created a perfect setting for the entrance of mr tolson with just a touch of drama tolson spun a yarn around the fact of his not having brought a written text and waltzed right into a reflection of a visit to an old poets grave whereupon there was engraved on the tombstone am dead as all can see ye bear you all to follow me pausing his head tilt back as though in deep meditation tolson said that the words on the tombstone made him think and then respond to follow you im not content until i know which way you went and as laughter filled the hall tolson rose from his chair with the energy of one of his pupils and in a sweeping gesture and a booming voice that rocked jubilee hall he roared nobody writes in a vacuum or out of a vacuumwhen a man writes he tells me which way he went in society the audience now spellbound listened as the man who might affectionately be called the grandfather of the conference spoke of the tridimensionality of man a man has his biology his sociology and his psychologyand then he becomes a poet glancing over his shoulder at hayden the grin on his face reminiscent of a mischievous lad once again tolsons tone was soft almost reverent hap hap let me see hap means accident is someone going to make m b tolson an accident youll never make me an accident and by this time his voice was blazing to the rafters as he exclaimed im a black poet an africanamerican poet a negro poet im no accidentand i dont give a tinkers damn what you think signs of tolson the educator mixed with the poet the dramatist and what have you as he gave a discourse on the word negro starting with its beginning as an adjective and advancing to its origin as a noun at the hands of the portuguese in senegal observing that there was no stigma attached to it until the coming of christian civilization tolson blamed capitalism for the worlds race problem he alluded to a play written by leroi jones the toilet suggesting that this country for all its criticism and controversy did not really understand what mr jones was talking about that young man is a symbol of the times said tolson everyone thinks he was talking about a toilet in harlem he wasnt talking about a toilet in harlemhe was talking about an entire civilization that has become a commode when the intellectuals and the artists condemn a civilization that doesnt mean that that civilization is in troubleit means its on its way out as expected the panel discussion inspired talk from the floor concerning the question of identity among the concerned was the graying james forman once the baby faced member of the civil_rights big four i think the question of whether or not one identifies himself as a negro writer has bearing on the choice of material one writes about said forman the irrepressible sncc veteran called attention to the fact that many negro writers fail to address themselves to the struggle of black people in this country suggesting that this was in part due to a lack of identity observing that little has been written about the southern freedom movement excepting the sensationalismoriented newspaper accounts and occasional magazine articles forman contended that an awful lot of negro writers are completely out of touch with the movement defending the writers cause miss walker promised that sunday afternoons poetry reading would include new poems relating to the southern freedom movement citing the example of dubois voluminous writings during his days as an activist bontemps raised the question of the small quantity of writing done by the modern day activists voicing his amazement at this point a member of the audience explaining that he was formerly a movement activist and is now a sometime writer suggested that the analogy of dubois to the current civil_rights workers was not quite fair as each of you writers know the creative exercise is a painful one well i just want to say that those involved in the movement and i dont mean those who occasionally picket are involved in an exercise as painful as writing many of the activists have written articles for various magazines but to ask them to do a great deal of writing would be asking too much of any man the speaker obviously impatient with the inability of his voice to keep pace with his thoughts next addressed himself to hayden mr hayden i dont think jim forman is questioning your ability to identify yourself as a negro you said that you didnt think you were consciously trying to escape but is it not true that perhaps you are unconsciously trying but before he could finish hayden interrupted saying that he was tired of being attacked at every writers conference insisting that he have his say the speaker asserted the question of whether or not you identify yourself as a poet who happens to be a negro or as a negro poet does have effect on the students who come in contact with you at this university it is a fact that many young black people leave fisk terribly deluded and someone is responsible for their delusion i am suggesting that you do have a re sponsibility to them a responsibility to help them understand that they will become black poets black teachers or what have youand whether you like it or not that is your problem baby the conference momentum was in full gear as the playwrights alice childress loften mitchell and william branch assembled sunday morning for the final panel what are the dramatists saying the woes of the black playwright in america were articulated by william branch who suggested that today in new york there is less chance than or years ago of the black playwright being produced loften mitchell read an essay from black drama a book of essays he is writing on the american negro in the theatre depicting the oppressive conditions under which the black playwright is forced to function born in harlem a stones throw from jimmy baldwin mitchell an earthy character who exudes youthful humor suggested that we havent gotten free yet we got integratedthe double doublecross his label for integration caught on and was heard late into the night branch suave pipe smoking contended that things cant get worse and asserted that we can no longer wait for the white brother to come to his senses we must establish black theatre not shutting anyone out but looking inside our own experiences whitey just aint gonna do it babywere going to have to do it proudly exclaiming im from harlem and i am a negro writer alice childress affectionately stated all i know of generosity and kindness and love i learned in harlem imagine a rose saying im not a rose im a flower well i am a rose and a flower i am a negro writer and also a part of universal man and with those words the author of trouble in mind cast an intense warmth throughout the hall miss childress blamed white america for the fact that the negro artist cannot earn a living in his field and accused the oppressors of also telling us how to react to the oppression she concluded that she believes all mankind should have the opportunity to become his highest self the question and answer session consisted mostly of an exchange between william melvin kelley and panelists branch and childress concerning the subject of federal monies the two panelists especially miss childress spoke extensively of federal monies available to the arts advising negro artists to take advantage of them kelleys position was that it would be useless to depend upon federal money because the man is not going to give you money and let you destroy his system the bearded intellectual author of a different drummer and a drop of patience warned against falling into what he called the capitalistic bagthinking money will set you free the general tone of the entire discussion reflected recognition of the need to utilize federal funds but not without an awareness of the possible inhibitions and limitations inherent in accepting such money after finally getting the floor which by then was becoming a problem james forman explained that his reason for attending the conference was to present some specific areas in which he felt his organization could work together with the writers and expressed hope that there could be a fruitful dialogue between the artists and the activists before the conference adjourned john killens then suggested that a special meeting be held immediately following the closing address by ossie davis a suggestion which met with enthusiasm from the audience sunday afternoons poetry reading session was a moving experience reading from harlem gallery and his exciting collection of african proverbs tolson delighted the crowd before hastily departing to a writers conference at princeton university reading his very pensive full moon robert hayden masterfully engaged his audience humbly expressing satisfaction with his prize winning a ballad of remembrance his reading from it as well as others of his poems was received with a warm appreciation that was a tribute to his artistry i think the activists lend an electric effect to this conference stated arna bontemps as he dedicated his poem the daybreakers to the determined young people the audience seemed to share bontemps nostalgia as he read works untarnished by the passing years there was in the closing lines of his poem golgotha is a mountain a certain spiritual ecstasy and subtle powerblack men should own those mountains and l am one of them living up to her promise margaret walker read poems dedicated to her late friend and neighbor medgar evers as well as poems to malcolm_x and the three young mississippi martyrs cheney goodman and schwerner the suffering and struggle of black people were the ingredients for her work now time to wipe away the slime time to end this bloody crime and the spunky i like it fine here in jail following the poetry session john killens was honored with a book party for his volume of essays black mans burden in a tribute to the stem but jovial writer father woodruff called him fully integrated and free there is no smallness in the man it was standing room only in jubilee hall sunday evening for the conference finale ossie davis the actorplaywright was intro duced by killens as one who is concerned about where were going and how were going to get there addressing himself to the theme of the conference davis spoke of the importance of images recalling that some years ago the then senator lyndon baines johnson said that he could not subscribe to sending troops into southeast asia to fight a white mans war davis observed that johnson thereby created an image citing this nations present involvement in vietnam he contended that it necessitated johnsons creating a new image and the new image he sought was to make it a black mans war and that is the reason per cent of the american troops in vietnam are black the applause delayed his continuing images said mr davis must correspond to some accepted reality upon which people communicate and agree davis contended that we must find new images that correspond to the objective facts of our lives we must seek new languagefor the language of uncle tom like uncle tom himself is dead the audience roared approval when he praised malcolm_x saying that the late leader had advanced to the point where he thought like an africanamerican citing malcolms having moved the struggle from civil_rights to the question of human rights davis asserted that malcolm knew that we must organize friends in africa so that anytime a foot stepped on a black man on one continent a black mans mouth would yell in the other revolution calls for the black man to break away as the son from the father said davis and for determining which image will prevail will it be the image of the middleclass honorary white man asked davis such an image according to the author of purlie victorious has a need for nonviolence it is the image that says we can make it with education cleanliness politeness and he observed that such an image still prevails in most of our universities adding that it also says please dont mix civil_rights with peace davis continued i would like to think that american society is basically sound and that we can reform it i would like to think that i could come through the gates and rise with everyone else but with his mind seemingly immersed in the reality of todays america he stated integration comes too late because the reason we are in this country has been taken out from under us by automation citing the history of the united states the fact that black people were brought to these shores as a source of cheap labor davis chronicled the times up to the present today three out of four negro jobs the unskilled jobs are being taken away and this nation is in the unique position of having more workers producing services than goods davis pointed out the fact that black people have no value to the country in terms of the services produced and observed that america because it no longer depends upon the exportation of goods exports capitaland thats why were in vietnam and thats why well be in vietnam the dominican republic and south africa this country has vast business interest in south africa until the last black american is dead he concluded that the image of the middleclass honorary white man is not a satisfactory one suggesting that we must base our image on the dispossessed in our nations harlems davis advised that we must relate to other nations of the world who just happen to be nonwhite viewing the recent overthrow of kwame nkrumah in ghana davis refuted the reasons usually cited by the american press insisting that we consider the fact that cocoa ghanas leading source of revenue suffered a price drop from cents a pound to cents a pound nkrumah or no other man could hold a government together under that kind of pressure said davis and he left no doubt as to who he felt was responsible for the disaster we are artists who must dare to deal in truth but there was deep concern in his voice as he cautioned but be mindful that power when threatened will crush suggesting that we not waste time on petty hatred davis said that there are those on both sides who are dead to the future in a candid message to white americans he charged those of good will with the responsibility to go and become missionaries in their own communitieseducate that bigot and teach him that his fate is tied to mine alluding to the oftmentioned leroi jones davis called him a shattered young man saying that jones realizes what this culture has done to his people and knows that we must create a new language do you know asked davis that because of the connotation the word black has in this culture when you look at your child and call him black you have already insulted him different ways davis then advised the audience to consult rogets thesaurus where they would find about words of negative connotation opposite the word black as opposed to about three opposite the word white leroi jones is aware of these facts said davis contending that we must arrive at a new image davis said it must have elements based on the man in the gutter and it must appeal to him if we accomplish this the writer will be the father of a new country davis concluded that black people in the face of oppression once came up with john henryand now it is your challenge to go home and do for automation what john henry did for the steam drill john killens made the closing observation that he was glad to see james forman and the activists at the conference because they know the importance of obtaining a new image and creating a new language among those present was cleveland sellers sncc program director speaking on behalf of the fisk university writers workshop mignon k holland an aspiring novelist expressed gratitude for the foresight and dedication of resigning fisk president stephen j wright without whom john killens brainchild would not have become a reality the conference officially closed but as planned the meeting of the minds continued in the post conference session resulting in plans for a meeting of artists and activists to be held in new york in june it was the first writers conference conducted on the campus of a major negro university and will rightfully take its place in historical annals a days living by dolores armstead t the top of the staira p way nell stood listeng ing for her daughters voice there was no sound the child was still asleep go now she intoned as she slowly descended the flight of wet and slippery stairs across the street three sister buildings gaped and shrank together as icecored snow fell through their demolished roofs down the razed skeletons to where furnaces had croaked up warmth for the flesh of a few aged jews and rooting puerto ricans nell ran in the beating snow impatiently bumping against the white hills of frozen garbage going in the direction of the subway at the essex street crossing she became aware of a whirwhir chaining close around her it was the snowplows moving in like battleships on the deep white sea her boots bleat as she darted in front of one of the scooping bullies the snow belting her face stung like stones but she could not turn back in her pocket were two subway tokens and she had to exchange them for thirty cents that would buy one quart of milk for her child past the winking neon of golds appetizers she ran then like the command of a master hypnotist the thing she feared asserted itself at the proper point of her mission she walked back to golds and gazed into the window there was only one clerk behind the counter the right one the three customers in the aisle were a dark fat blur nell entered the shop stood with her back to the candy and eyed the sturgeon once she had bought strings of licorice here and as before there seemed something comic about the wizened herring in their pickling barrels reposing ruefully across the aisle from pastel mints and bon bons the clerk deftly rolled a pound of fish in thick wrappings for a bent old man while two girls fussed over sweets ill be right with you the clerk said to nell she turned away not yet willing to meet his eyes she felt cold and numb and she wished for a warming drink yet she wanted her cold insides to freeze every instinct that might betray the approaching tide of lies when the customers left the clerk walked up the aisle toward her i came to ask a favor of you nell blurted as if to stall his approach whereve you been the clerk said around she said slowly gaining control i feel awfully silly asking she smiled prettily but will you give me thirty cents for these two subway tokens the tokens gleamed on the brown palm of her glove why didnt you come back that night i wasoh kind of scared she answered still with the guarded innocent smile scared of me i waited for you i looked in the streets for you believe me youve been on my mind since that one night you came in the store nearly drove me crazy when you didnt come back like you said you shouldnt do something like that he held her arm as if she might fly or sink im sorry nell sighed shaking her scarf to her shoulders but ive got a kid you see shes two and i didnt have anyone to stay with her that night he passed his hand over her hair and nell felt a thickening at her scalp as if the roots were kinking from sweat are you married he asked sseparated she said not knowing if it was the truth or a lie id like to see you could i visit you sometime i supposebut my husband pops up every now and then we could go out dinner a show ill pay your sitter i dont know anybody around here to get for a sitter whos with the kid now i left her sleeping she said i had to come out look will you do me a favor and give me thirty cents for these two tokens you need change i need milk for my baby she rapped this darned blizzard were practically starving her thoughts strayed to herman he couldnt leave the baby he was a good father to the baby even when they fought hell come back she reasoned just as soon as the storm breaks the clerk put two quarts of milk in a paper bag were one of the few places still got milk in this blizzard no delivery what else you want you can have anything in the store only milk she said craving the expensive sturgeon take some candy to the kid he put chocolate covered jellies and mints into a bag and placed the packages beside her whats your name nell she said nellie he chuckled reaching for her hand my names sol lets go in the back of the store nellie show you my office slowly she trudged to the rear he turned to face her his eyes were large and pale as a shadow they grew large and urgent as an alms plate he was a lonely man he was married hed had a summer affair with another colored girl like you nellie with fire in her eyes data related like routine instructions before an examination nell looked around for a chair he pulled her close she had to keep back the tears he didnt want her for back alleys she was beautiful he wanted to help her he had to have her nell drooped with the blow of a migraine as he alluded to intimacy they could enjoy kiss me nellie she leaned stiffly toward him and he pressed his body against her she rubbed a trembling hand against his chest fighting not to push him away youre my girl he said sol i she could think of nothing to say and she could no longer smile what would you do if the store was closed and i had you here with me how can i get in touch with you if she leaned against the crates that lined the wall of the narrow room heres my card sol said call me tomorrow around seven he took her hand and led her back to the front of the store nell looked around at the fish and the bon bons she buttoned her coat and tied the scarf in a hard knot under chin sol she began slowly will you give me the money for these tokens he dug into his pocket here take this no she said looking at the folded bill just exchange the tokens please fair trade go on take it he insisted i want to help you ok thanks she took the folded bill stuck it inside her glove with his card thank you for the milk and candy too we can work things out he said youll see ill treat you nice you call me tomorrow i think youre very kind with a measure of compassion she looked into his eyes searching for a glint of light among the shadowy grey a woman swathed in mink entered the shop and sol was at once behind the counter glancing at nell only an instant more nell gathered her packages and slipped away the cold the snow and tears bit into her cheeks she unfolded the bill he had given her a dollar she could buy a little food why harlem needs a cultural center by dr esther jackson harlem need a cultural center the answer is obviously yes in the sixties we in america are beginning to recognize that the arts are a necessary element of all human experience a component as basic to the lifeprocess as food shelter or clothing the arts are not forms of decoration they relate to the entire process of human learning to the total pattern of mans imaginative symbolic and creative activity when we speak of the arts therefore we do not restrict our consideration to conventional forms such as painting sculpture literature dance and drama we refer to the entire range of created symbols which give concrete shape to human consciousness not simply architecture and painting but also roads bridges and trestles not merely sculpture and crafts but also spacecraft and missiles not alone poetry music and dance but also equations theorems and propositions not only scenery and costumes but also furniture jewelry and dress we are in short concerned with the whole of mans created life with his rituals myths images social structures and patterns of intellectual life as well as with his expressive forms indeed those forms which we describe as theatre music literature dance and the plastic arts are but the expressions of a larger and more complex pattern of activity which is at once individual and collective in nature the chief function of the arts is to give shape to the complete world of human experience but the arts have a second function in society they are not only charged with signifying the basic content of experience they are in many senses a technique of discovery the arts are lenses through which men see interpret and evaluate experience it is because of this intimate relationship to seeing and knowing that they are so important to us at this point in american history we owe to the great philosopher john deweyamong othersa better understanding of the role of the arts in the intellectual social psychological and moral growth of the individual dewey described the function of the arts as instrumental for they not only reflect what the creator thinks about reality they affect the way in which other individuals interpret that same reality the influence of the arts as a moral agent has concerned writers from the time of plato to our own day what may be even more important in this discussion however is the effect of the arts on the total process of learning contemporary theories of learning would seem to support the contention that many intellectual skills understandings and knowledges have their origins in the arts that the symbolic structure of the arts is fundamental to all learning we contend that the acquisition of learning in fields as seemingly dissimilar as mathematics literature and the social sciences is de pendent in large measure on a single factor the presence of a mature flexible and appropriate system of symbols an individual cannot think about indeed perhaps cannot even recognize thingsinthemselves unless he has within his imagination a clear and appropriate symbol intellectual development and growth seem thus to be dependent on the quality maturity accuracy and reliability of symbolic structures it is in large measure through exposure to the arts that primary symbolic structures develop art is not then a decorative exterior applied to the surface of experience it is rather the concrete evidence of a way of viewing reality it follows that every individual like every community has such a pattern that is to say every individual like every communityhas an imaginative structure through which it sees interprets and evaluates life in such a structure we may find a critical measure of the intellectual social psychological and moral values of the community every individual in every community reads some kinds of literature wears some kinds of clothes and jewelry participates in some kinds of rituals shares some myths lives in some kind of architecture enjoys some dramatic experiences hears music creates verse develops ideas and finally seeks to find beauty harmony truth and meaning in his life that which distinguishes one kind of arts structure from another is not motive rather it is the quality of those created forms which the individual and society jointly evolve art may thus be sophisticated or naive lifeaffirming or lifenegating harmonious or disordered subjective or objective immature or highly developed misleading or enlightening permanent in value or frankly topical in general then we may say that the arts mirror the stage of development to which the communitylike the individual creatorhas come we in the harlem community today are not as much concerned with this representational aspect of the arts as we are with their effect upon the individual and the group for we recognize the arts as an unequalled teaching device which speaks not only of those concrete truths which are the province of the sciences but also of those ambiguous and elusive forms of understanding which affect human behaviour at its unreasoning roots if the sciences and the social sciences speak of those areas of human experience which are judged to be within the effective control of reason the arts are concerned with those areas of human behaviour which are manifestly without the arts speak of those hidden areas of human consciousness in which our drives have their origin of love and hate fear and courage suffering and joy beauty and ugliness and of tranquility and violence moreover it is the arts which dare to speak of these areas of human behaviour with complete relevance accuracy and candour when we talk of a program in the arts for this community we are not speaking of a performance schedule nor do we conceive primarily of a building rather we look forward to the launching of a total community effort which will not only seek to mirror that stage of growth at which we now find ourselves but which will be concerned with the development of that kind of symbolic and imaginative activity which will improve and enhance the quality of our individual and collective experience such a program cannot concern itself entirely with the reflection of things as they are nor yet with the glorification of things as they were rather it must devote its attention to the creation of life as it ought to be we must ask ourselves what does such a program have to contribute to the improvement of life in the harlem community to greater political economic social and cultural opportunity to the constructive use of conflict to the development of better interpersonal relationships to the effective use of personal capabilities to the acceleration of individual achievements to the motivation of higher standards to the clarification of human problems to the projection of more desirable values to the creation of a physical environment of greater beauty to the stimulation of a greater sense of personal appreciation to the development of a sense of joy to the swift achievement of social justice an arts center in harlem should then provide a base for the projection of these universal values in the communityatlarge but such a center has in an even more complex task for harlem is not an ordinary american community it is a community which has survived extended exploitation and which yet suffers social psychological economic and cultural ills which are reflected in the lives of its population one of the clear objectives of an arts program in such an area is to contribute to the eradication of the conditions of such exploitation the function of an arts center cannot be therefore to lock the doors of the community against the world rather the purpose of such a center must be to provide the residents of the community with such personal resources as will radically accelerate their potential growth and substantially increase their contact with the larger world clearly the emphasis of such a program must be on the young especially on that segment of the population which is less than years of age the projected center cannot afford to develop programs which are restricted to the job interests and cultural patterns of older generations of harlemdwellers rather our clear mandate is to increase opportunity for the young by broadening the range and improving the quality of cultural experience the harlem center must not capitulate to the wellmeaning exponents of separate but equal art nor can it seek to repeat many patterns of programming which were successful in eras of more limited opportunity the harlem center must not be seen as an alternative to participation in institutions such as the lincoln center or the new york shakespeare festival or the museum of modern art it ought not be regarded as an escape from our clear responsibility to insist on the speedy desegregation of career opportunities in the major cultural institutions of this and other cities in america rather the harlem cultural center should provide the negro community with an effective base from which its campaign to desegregate the arts in new york city and in americaatlarge may be effectively launched it would seem to me then that the proposed center has five specific functions to support the formal educational process by providing the citizens of the harlem community with a representative selection of the finest examples of world art to offer systematic assistance to gifted young people in the development of their own talents to expose all young people to that basic arts experience which is fundamental to creative achievement in all professions and careers and which is an essential instrument in the pursuit of happiness to equip young people with those verbal and intellectual skills aesthetic concepts and moral values which we in america believe to be prerequisite to professional and personal advancement in the world of the twentieth century to provide a home for the large community of gifted performers who have failed to gain appropriate opportunities and rewards because of discriminatory practice in the arts and at the same time to offer broader opportunities to gifted performers of all racial and ethnic groups to demonstrate that desegregation in the arts may be achieved in america to the advantage of the artist the profession the spectator and the nationatlarge how can these objectives be achieved certainly the establishment of a program of such comprehensive intent requires an apparatus of great efficiency there are subsumed in these objectives four areas for immediate action professional and preprofessional training audience education social and educational services community action if we are to realize our common goals for the center a plan for action in each of these four areas must precede the establishment of physical facilities such a plan should bring into effective and appropriate conjunction the activities of existent community structures certainly the program of the center should be viewed as a supplement rather than as an alternative to systematic arts education in the public school curriculum in the same way any proposed plan for professional and preprofessional training in the arts must be developed with regard for established standards of creative performance a different kind of coordination is required to develop a program which is supportive of the goals of social agencies and religious organizations and finally the center must assume the major role in our struggle to desegregate the arts particularly to open serious opportunities for career growth and development in those institutions which are partially or wholly supported by public subsidy the center both in terms of theory and example should serve as a lever in the larger struggle for cultural opportunity in american life from it should issue an intensive drive to insure systematic advancement in the arts for talented members of all minority groups but more than this the center must provide a plan of action which will not only advance the careers of performing artists but which will open career opportunities in the hundreds of supportive occupations associated with the arts the drive for equal opportunity in the arts must not be conceived alone to affect actors musicians painters dancers and writers but also designers technicians costumers business managers advertising copyists choreographers directors arrangers and museum workers clearly the key to these advances is community action an action which is not restricted to artists alone but which engages the efforts of our political and professional leadership in the nationatlarge for the future of the arts in our country will to a large degree be determined by the future of the arts in new york new york in many senses the cultural capital of the world is perhaps of unequalled importance as a symbol of the cause of unlimited human opportunity and so it is that the time for a civil_rights program in the arts has clearly come the necessity of such action becomes even clearer when we realize that vast new funds for the support of the arts will soon be available through legislative action the antipoverty bill the elementary and secondary education bill andwe hopethe arts and humanities bill promise to support the growth of the arts throughout the country the harlem community not only has a right it has a clear responsibility to insist that taxderived funds shall not be used to reenforce pervasive patterns of discrimination against negro artists spectators and school children festival postscripts ie hopes that the story is apocryphal the way it goes the prime movers of the american committee for the first world festival of negro arts were considering which group of musicians to invite to dakar as exemplars of jazz music in america benny goodman and his sidemen were mentioned but it was remembered that the state department already had sent them on such a tour then woody herman and his orchestra were suggested and the idea was received with much enthusiasm but then someone asked the number of negroes in mr hermans current herd as it turned out duke ellington and his orchestra were chosen as the musicians to carry the message of jazz to dakar but the above storywhether apocryphal or true tells much about the orientation of the american committee in the first place only a few thousand american negroes knew anything about either the american committee or the first world festival of negro arts itself for an event of such importance in the negro world this neglect was all but criminal the selection of mrs virginia innessbrown as chairman of the american committee was an incredibly obvious blunder mrs innessbrown is a wealthy new yorker with an avid interest in the theatre she has many friends in high places including the government in washington and she can call on these people for support in her charitable work apparently her concern for projects affecting negroes is genuine however that is not the point mrs innessbrown is white and it should be immediately clear to anyone with knowledge of contemporary realities that it simply is not appropriate that a white person be the head of a committee for a festival of negro arts not surprisingly then the same kind of thinking that went into the selection of a white person as chairman of the american committee was evident in the selecting of american participants in the festival there is no quarrel with the choice of duke ellington this great musician cannot be overhonored and his reception at dakar was eloquent proof of the acceptance of his work in the negro world however most of the other choices were less wise the american committee chose armenta adams a classical pianist and martina arroyo a soprano who recently appeared at the metropolitan opera and while both are fine artists they were all but wasted at dakar there is nothing particularly negro about a pianist playing bach preludes and a soprano singing verdi arias that they can perform this music superbly is one thing but the performance of it at a festival of negro arts is quite another the same observations are pertinent relative to the selection of leonard de paur and his chorus to appear at dakar mr de paur is a gentleman of superior intellectual and musical attainments but there is little that is negro about his musical presentation beyond the fact that he and most of the men in his chorus are black it is true that the chorus introduced a brace of african tunes enchantingly done but that program would be infinitely more effective before an american or europeanor even japaneseaudience or for that matter before an african audience so long as the context is not one of negro arts africans do them more authentically it so happened that the most inspired choice of the american committee received the least adequate showcasing and consequently failed of potential impact marion williams and her gospel singers brought a measure of excitement to the festival but the group performed only in the cathedral of dakar which has poor acoustics and limited capacity misses adams and arroyo also appeared in the cathedral to unfortunate effect this amazonian woman and her rhythmic singing and clever showmanship captured the audience but the audience was primarily white with a sprinkling of upperclass africans the reason more than per cent of the senegalese are moslems and the masses do not feel comfortable or welcome for that matterin a christian house of worship it was not the american committees fault that miss williams and her group were not scheduled for the seat daniel sorano theatre or for the outdoor stadium it was a question of priorities and the other american performersellington and de paur had higher priority however there was some embarrassment expressed by highly placed americans relative to the uninhibited performance of the gospel singers miss williams and her singers lacked dignity it was claimed and told that it was a pity that the masses of africans would not have the benefit of miss williams art one director of the festival a frenchman replied but what does it matter everyone of any importance is here at the cathedral everyone of any importance when the audience consisted of only a few hundred people most of whom were white such unfortunately were some of the attitudes which contributed to disappointments at the festival at the last minute the day before the festival ended the alvin ailey dancers appeared at the daniel sorano theatre andfrom all reportssalvaged the sagging prestige of the american representation mr aileys troupe arrived from rome substituting for the arthur mitchell dance group which due to lack of funds cancelled out it was in all probability a good thing that mr mitchell did not come mr mitchell is a fine ballet dancer but mr ailey whose forte is modern dancing is less oriented toward the classical mr ailey brought some fresh ethnic feeling to the festival the world festival of negro arts at dakar was billed as the first looking toward a similar festival every two years there is by no means any assurance that there will be a second festival but one hopes that there will be and if there is one hopes that the american committee for the festival will have a broader base and will include among its active members negroes who are interested in and who make an identification withthe ordinary negro people of this country last january in dakar mrs innessbrown was told that the american committee for the festival had failed to communicate with the general negro public those for whom such a festival would mean most in terms of education and spiritual regeneration a white new york public relations firm had been hired to publicize the festival and this firm proceeded in what must be its normal way of reaching its public no special effort was made to interest the negro press for instance in fact mrs innessbrown was told that the white public relations firm concentrated on white newspapers and magazines most of which are in new york and it was pointed out to her that the new york times for example had limited negro readership even in new york it also was pointed out to mrs innessbrown that the white press had scant interest in a world festival of negro arts a contention which was borne out by the paltry publicity accorded the festival in the american press only life magazine devoted more than minimal photo space to the festival and few papers besides the new york times and the washington post published more than a single report of the festival both time and newsweek ignored it it is inconceivable that the american press would have remained so indifferent to say a world festival of western white arts and mrs innessbrown was informed of this fact she disagreed as did the cultural attache of the american embassy at dakar but both learned that the american press indeed has limited interest in events concerning negroes despite the large negro readership in american cities the american committee worked closely with the state department in planning american participation in the festival and there is little question that this collaboration had a significant influence on the quality of the american representation the state department contributed at least in the way of expenses rescuing the committee which failed utterly to find its minimum budget of it is reported that the state department was at first reluctant to be identified with the festival on the grounds that its emphasis on negritude gave it racist overtones the us state department these days is all for integration the state department did agree to help the american committee and there was little doubt at dakar that the state departments assistance was crucial to the functioning of the american committee however there remains the question of whether state department collaboration is entirely desirable that question becomes especially pertinent if that collaboration also means endorsement and approval of artists and performers slated to participate in the festival would the state department approve the appearance of jazz musicians or blues singers who have been convicted as narcotics addicts for example or would writers who have consistently opposed the governments position in cuba the dominican republic and vietnam receive state department approval in both instances the answer is probablyand understandably no and yet such musicians and writers are likely to be among the negro artists who could bring to a world festival the essence of the negro experience in america mrs innessbrown also was told that many american negro artists were not participating in the festival because they objected to the fact that a white person was chairman of the american committee it was explained that there was not necessarily any specific objection to mrs innessbrown as a person but only to the fact of the chairman being white it did not seem appropriate unfortunately mrs innessbrown seemed to feel that the objections were personal during the discussion mrs inat thies detroit artist henri king visited atelier of friend papa ibra tall one of senegals top painters tall directs school of design and tapestry nessbrown made an important point which needs to be stated and accentuated she said that negroes generally do not support charitable or cultural projects andthe inference wasthat it was necessary that someone like herself take the helm in order to assure the success of such projects as the festival efforts had been made she said to collect from negroes some of the budget necessary for the american committee but that negroes had contributed virtually nothing later several wellknown negroes in attendance at the festival were asked about mrs innessbrowns contention and they agreed that the lady indeed spoke the truth the wife of an american negro diplomat recalled the years when the naacp sought desperatelyand without successto collect funds from negroes only weeks earlier in chicago harry belafonte sidney poitier mahalia jackson and dick gregory had participated in a rally which raised more than for civil_rights work and this was cited as an example of how negroes cooperated today when they were led to feel that they were involved in a project or movement this was an example it was said of how negroes feel and act now but is it if the chairmanship of the american committee for the second world festival of negro arts goes as it should to a negro will the negroes in this country come to the support of the committee and assure it of enough money to send truly representative performers and artists to participate in the festival will they mrs innessbrown indicated that following the first world festival of negro arts she would keep the festival committee alive and perhaps organize something like a foundation to aid young negro artists in pursuing their studies and their crafts it is a laudable plan and it is hoped that it will be realized however if there is going to be another festival it also is hoped that efforts will be made to find some able negro to head the american committee it also is hoped that efforts will be made to involve the negro public in the festival the originators of the festival conceived it as a living illustration of the concept of negritude and the negroes of americamore than those of any other country or continentneed to understand and to give attention to that concept hoyt w fulle who needs negro digest with so many other magazines on the marketfrom the big slick picture magazines to the thin intellectual journalssuch a magazine as negro digest might appear almost irrelevant but who nowadays calls the negros aspirations writings thoughts and actions irrelevant this is what negro digest is all about negro digest is the only such magazine that frankly reveals what the people of color arc doing saying and thinking as reflected in its articles essays general features short stories forums informational notes poetry and priceless humor negro oigl provides an outlet for wellknownas well as the new and young articulate writers and thinkers and provides a source for those seeking negro historical facts guidance and information important to ones wellbeing perhaps this is why negro digest has been called the most stimulating magazine on the market by teachers housewives professionals and others who are aware in the true sense of the word who needs negro digest not every person but then not every person dares to think honestly and creatively about shaping his own destiny improving the lives of others or changing even a small corner of the world in which he lives such thoughts are too uncomfortable they have been known to start revolutions
while watching the rew cent pattersonclay fight an interesting thought occurred to me as the two dark sinewy goliaths danced about like ideas under the bright american klieg lights in a fundamental sense the difference between these two people is that patterson is a negro and clay is a man it occurred to me that the image of uncle tom is not a dangerous one in this country but the image of the negro is but before i go further perhaps i should first define him the negro is a man of apparent african ancestry he was born and has since lived in american society he lives and works with people a vast majority of whom have no apparent african ancestry he takes a dim view of his own african ancestry and knows little usually absolutely nothing about it if he adopts a foreign country it will more likely be a european than an african or eastern one he believes his racial lineage is a dark secret hopelessly muddled by intertribal interracial interbreeding after the arrival of the african slaves in the new world hence his past is considered of little or no significance to him in his present life his entire world is defined by the presence the opinions and the attitudes of the white majority who live in his society he relies upon their aid and good will for his health his safety and his general welfare and is conscious as he is constantly reminded of this reliance he accepts this majoritys standards of speech dress and behavior as his own and pushes himself and his family to achieve them he envies and admires their station in life their standard of living and their physical characteristics he harbors no resentment no malice no repugnancy no indignation for any catastrophe suffered by any of his race at the hand of the white majority except as these may be provoked by an isolated event he aspires to be loved by all people and puts special stock in expressions of love and respect or consideration as these may come to him from white people he has ambivalent attitudes toward other negroes and is generally envious of those above him in education or status as he despises and finds himself unable to understand those beneath him in education and status because in truth he has no history no race no class and no identity he is at the same time every man and no man he is in a word what the white man has made him what kind of posture should be expected of a manand throughout this discussion man should be underlinedwith black skin in the american environment would such a man be indignant at his treatment some of the time most of the time all of the time would he express his indignation at every opportunity rarely ever james baldwin has said that to be black in america and be reasonably perceptive is to be in a constant state of rage if this be true and i believe it is what is meant when a quiet obsequious understanding negro is known by whites as a good negro a nice colored fellow an i wish all negroes were like you type person the answer is that he is being recognized as a negro and an opinion is being reserved not expressed or negatively expressed on the question of his manhood hence the statements should have little meaning except to white people and should cause black people to wince one cannot drive in neutral along the ways and byways of race in this country particularly if you are of color the massiveness of the experience has a way of posturing you from the negro one knows not what to expect for he is rather like a straw in the wind being tossed hither and thither by the vagaries of his own thought and that of the majority culture which dictates its content for the man who has black skin there is no doubt as to his posture so long as the plight of his people is as bad as it is you may expect at the very least an intelligent demurrer more often than not when the question of race is brought up he is indignant the emotion is not unhealthy psychologically or socially given the problems to be solved in our racially sick society the most constructive emotion is that which leads to indignation and a resolve to do something about the situation only a man a full human being has the capacity both to feel indignation and methodically resolve to dry up its source at any cost nonhumans like dogs can be pulled by the ears and kicked in the rump by a master for years and when thrown a bit of sap will forget the earlier indignities overlook the vulnerability to future indignities and yelp with unrestrained glee the same may be observed of babies who suffer indignities before the age of intelligent perception the same may not be said of men nor of nations or not of such of these as have survived the surest evidence that the negro has not been granted the right to manhood in this country is seen in the denial of the right to be indignant however the right to indignation i would defend is the right to intelligent indignation this is not an attempt at snobbishness rather it is a recognition that in any mature society temper tantrums are not long and regularly to be tolerated from adults this brings us to a consideration of the variety of indignation expressed by the black muslims which this writer is not prepared unequivocally to defend the muslims are considered a hate group not so much because their social doctrine necessitates it but rather because they do such unintelligent things as making ceremonious reference to whites as devils the enemy and worse such childish rhetoric is totally unnecessary and superfluous to the ends the muslims themselves seek the muslim creed represents a variety a brand of black nationalism the central theoretic assumption of black nationalism is that before the negro can ever be truly free he must effect a psychic separation from the idea of whiteness that is he must stop believing in it so much that he cannot believe in himself the muslim idea of a separate state is a reification of this slightly more complex notion and it puts it by making it concrete in terms the uneducated layman can grasp if one can entertain the notion of a physical separation from whites and can accept this idea with equanimity then it becomes proportionately easier to come to grips with the idea of a mere psychological separation the muslims realize and rightly so that it is impossible utterly impossible for a negro to be consistently of service to his people so long as he is hung up on the idea of whiteness and all this entails their aim is to make the socalled socalled negro of use to the race as a whole they realize they must first pry him away from his obsession with whiteness and they try to do this in the only way they presently know to do it as often happens in the affairs of men they fail because there means defeat their ends every organization or individual does have the prerogative to express its or his indignation in any way seen fit intelligent or unintelligent the unfortunate thing about the muslim choice is that an otherwise excellent program for individual and group improvement is drowned out in a course of hostility from negroes and whites alike their program could succeed without the allegiance of whites but not without that of blacks white opinion in america unfortunately runs only a truncated course before it becomes negro opinion though the converse of this is rarely true and thisthe logic of thisthe muslims have not been careful to bear in mind one report that a muslim publication has headlined the white race as devils shapes more attitudes than a million reports of positive accomplishments by the group in large part because the white race is paranoid about such things and in equally large part because opinion in america is shaped by newspapers and television and these media feast on the sensational rather than the qualitatively newsworthy unless the muslims change their miserable public relations the logic of this is that the possibility of the organization ever becoming an effective force in the black community is nil none and the negro will live on in all his vainglory yet they are to be complimented for reflecting more humanness than negroes or negro organizations are generally able to muster when they are hurt they bleed and become indignant and humane people respect them for this human beings respect all human beings who become indignant in the face of civil wrongs human beings are not expected to act as negroes have acted in the face of outrages and many people have marveled at the patience and restraint managed by the negro freely translated this means that they would not have been so restrained had the outrages been committed against them but then they are not negroes so there you have it for a time negroes stopped acting like negroes and their organizations stopped acting like negro organizations and for the first time the negro people had a whiff of manhood in the early s the wife of a famous white southern judge who tired of the negro charades in south carolina was forced to exclaim if you want to know what i think you people can do you can stop praying and get off your knees and fight shortly thereafter a wave of negro indignation did sweep the country and people all over the world rallied behind the negro cause as they saw an angry people take to the streets invade theretofore sanctimonious private property and serve notice in a very often violent and vituperative tone that they were fed up and wanted the white man to get his foot off the black mans throatin a word saying everything the muslims have said since the time of fardexcept that white people were not called spineless devils for the first time people came to talk of the courage and bravery of negroes at a time when they were doing battle with the white community rather than when they were engaged in the obsequious waiting action the negro himself took pride in his new posture and many for the first time could greet caucasians with heads held high people began to talk of a sense of pride and dignity felt by the young people who participated in the demonstrations the truth is that for the first time these peopleoften against the better judgment of their elders abandoned their negroness and became human beings this is the most crucial question that must be posed and answered before there can be a solution to the race problem in the united states it is in a word whether it is possible to be both negro and human what kind of category is negro does it rule out indignation pride dignity given our situation in american society it is here submitted that we are only human when we are angry or indignant like king in pursuit of injustice or cassius clay when he faces a white world that would forbid his being anything other than their image of a negro when we achieve our racial manhood we will live daily with a resolution to protect our sense of self worth in the fullest possible manner and perhaps the negro will of necessity be laid to rest in relative peace with uncle tom how many negroes read the new york daily news the los angeles times the new york times presumably substantial numbers the audiences of such journals like the audiences of the television news shows are not segregated and yet the negro already fighting against the neighborhood school and de facto segregation in housing has to contend with still another separatist institution the press what is usually called the pressas in power of or freedom ofis a white press distinctly different from negro press the white press plays two roles in the race situation first because negroes read it it is one of the agencies through which the pervasive ideas of the culture are introduced into the ghetto at the same time the press unconsciously reinforces white attitudes which make it impossible for the negro to escape from the ghetto one of the pervasive ideas in american society is that publicity is a great healing agent once a bad situation has been exposed the belief is it somehow magically goes away the negro cause has had wide publicity in recent years a good deal of the publicity has been concerned with the funerals of negro martyrs but legislation voting rights riots and negro leadership have had a large amount of journalistic attention too in the minds of many middleclass white people this publicity solves the problem who needs a house if hes got the headlines the negro poor for their part have discovered to their subsequent embitterment that despite all the tv newspaper and magazine coverage of race relations the rats go right on biting the babies in harlem thus a social phenomenonthe nationwide belief in the curative powers of publicity has increased tension between negro and caucasian the white press obviously aspires to influence thought for it employs besides its regular editorial writers whole coveys of commentators syndicated columnists writers of thinkpieces pundits political experts etc but over and over these opinionmakers unwittingly reveal that they write for the white communitys point of view and not as spokesmen for the whole republic for example when there are negro riots the white editorialists point out that the negro leaders are middle class and cannot control the negro poor but they omit to mentionnot out of unscrupulousness but because it does not occur to themthat there are no white leaders who can control the white poor bombings night riding beatings up intimidation and assassination are activities of the white poor which parallel negro riots and from local mayor to american president from local constabulary to the fbi there have been no white leaders able to control them a famous political columnist announcing after the rochester riots of that the black community must learn to discipline its unruly elements is voicing the sentiments of a white press similarly the idea is often put forward in the press that the negro should be worthy of the vote whereas in america nobody has to be worthy of the vote the right to vote is something one is born with if he is an american citizen and save for convicted felons it cannot be withheld on grounds that ones behavior fails to please more than that a vote is something that belongs to an individual as a right it has nothing to do with a group to which he may belong negroes are adjured by caucasian journalists to obey the law of the land no matter what their grievances and respect for the law is held up to them by these writers as an obligation which takes precedence over any injury however lasting or however mortal only a bare handful of the political deansand sages remember to add to their exhortation to negroes the reminder to whites that a law on the books is meaningless if it is not properly enforced according to drew pearsons syndicated column of september which reads more as if it came from the negro press than the white only four registrars had as of then been provided for the entire state of mississippi there is supposed to be one registrar per county and there are counties in the state the law of the land rhetoric impresses white readers but must it not convince negroes that american journalism insofar as it tries to influence opinion is basically dedicated to the status quo and the continuing comfort and convenience of white people negroes cannot possibly forget that the murderer of medgar evers has not been convicted nor the murderers of emmett till the murderers of the three young civil_rights workers and the murderers of countless other negroes or friends of the negro a negros experience with and reaction to the law of the land is different from a white mans and unless the white reader is also reading the negro press he cannot safely feel that he has gotten the full picture one liberal white columnist with an otherwise good record for supporting the negro cause recently stated that the adam powells precisely because they were congress men with power to get things done are chiefly responsible for the miserable conditions of their own districts but how much power do ghetto congressmen have in reality in the event that adam powell had had a vision on the road to damascus and become quite a different person could he have cleaned up and regenerated harlem to give them credit the opinionmakers in the white press rarely themselves maintain that the negroes are going too far and too fast but many of them quote with editorial clucking sounds polls which allege that large numbers of white people feel this way and thus give their readers a kind of crowd sanction for obstructionist feelings and perhaps actionsabout racial equality when negroes march and pray and demonstrate in the streets and cause trouble they are frequently toldin newspapers white people readthat they are doing their cause more harm than good and that they should take their wrongs to court the negro has been in the courts for a long time the supreme court decision of was the culmination of many years struggle in the courts and back in the s the naacp under the leadership of such men as walter white began to fight case after weary case in state and federal courts to end jim crow in interstate buses that was the beginning of the negro strugglenot given publicity until a generation later for integration in public accommodations law and order is not just a matter of negroes putting a lid on their anger or bluecoated policemen putting it on for them to an astonishing extent negroes have themselves shown a respect for law and order behaving with restraint even under severe provocation but law and orderif they are to be lasting and reliable rather than momentary and precariousmust have a sound basis in attitudes and feelings from crispus attucks through thomas wentworth higginsons black regiment to the present leaders of the negro revolution negroes have played a part in american history but when a negro who is aware of this sits down in a negotiating situation with a white man who thinks negroes were merely passive objects for whom lincoln wrote the emancipation proclamation there is a good chance of there being no meeting of the mind perhaps there ought to be more negroes writing for the press with full freedom to explain themselves and to say what is in their hearts then when a white commentator in paragraphs read by millions of white readerswarns negroes hot to alienate the white community a negro commentator in the adjoining column could remind these same readers that many negroes live in hourly peril of the uncontrolled white poor without ade quate protection against injury in advance or redress after it has been inflicted the negro revolution has become almost a comfortable phrase so much has it been in peoples mouths denial of voting rights has had enough coverage so that many whites think that once all the negroes in the country are free to vote unhindered the negro revolution will have succeeded and will pass from the headlines to be heard no more but negro leadership of all kinds both conservative and radical is aware that that is almost a soapopera version of the reality the schools negro children should be attending have not yet been built the teachers who should be instructing in those schools have not yet been hired the housing which should accommodate negroes exists only in token form these things cost money the money can be provided in sufficient quantity only by diverting funds from one or more of our current preoccupations from the space program from the highway program which supports the automobile industry or from the war in vietnam negroes have never been included on terms of equality in our socioeconomic system spending the money to include themand there is no other way they can be brought inwill involve a major reconstruction of our society the press is an established institution and as such is not by nature friendly to the idea of drastic social change but it could contribute substantially to an orderly transition into the future by becoming aware of its own parochial quality it is within the power of the press to make negroes feel less like voices crying in the wilderness and more like people who are being listened to it is within the power of the press to open the eyes of white people to their own insularity i am speaking as a i white to the whites in the civil_rights movement who threaten at times with their blundering ignorant good intentions to dominate its organizations thereby forcing the negro people to resist this new white superiority and paternalism a minor policy decision was being debated in our local naacp branch meeting the branch the only negro civil_rights organization in this small northern city has spoken for its five percent negro population over the years trying to defend it against as unconsciously cruel and arrogant a white power structure as any that has penned the negro populations in the great ghettos of chicago or new york the naacp here is not yet a mass organization the anger and outrage of our negro community is only beginning to coalesce in organized action present at the meeting were some of the old and faithful negro members a few new ones and the new white liberals wearing the ostentatious smugness that is the reward for salving the conscience with good works the discussion continued for some minutes it was not strictly a blackwhite debate for the negro members were divided on the question the new white liberals were not they were on their feet eager and opinionated i listened without deciding my position quickly i was really not certain that i knew enough to form an intelligent opinion i would vote with the man whose judgment of the problem i most respected and i presumed that vote would be against the white liberal bloc i was right but the white liberal votes carried the motion at the heart of the civil_rights movement in the north the fundamental questions continue to be debated whose civil_rights movement should the basic policymaking within it remain with the negroes if so where do the whites belong should they be relegated to some sort of secondclass citizenship within the movement but is not this the antithesis of the democratic and egalitarian goals of the movement every day of our lives our whole white western culture teaches us that we the white people are superior to the darkskinned peoples of the world without this basic tenet the entire value system of our culture is invalid yet within this culture arises the pity and compassion that lead many whites to civil_rights activity this is still white superioritythe newest and most enlightened master on the plantation but no less a plantation even the writings of white men of courage and good will reflect this they imply in effect i am infinitely sorry for you because you are black for it is better to be white than black but because you had the misfortune to be born black i will fight for your opportunity and right to try to be as white as i the civil_rights movement does not need these new masters possibly this is the only way a white can approach the negro people and the civil_rights movement his whiteness his western culture are the norm and the goal what else they are indivisible from him like every other white i brought my superiority to the civil_rights movement tempered by the uncomfortable realization that my white skin was probably an offense to some of my negro associates this much i had learned from the negro writers that white is not better than black that the negro people do not want to be white and that many of them dislike whites for excellent reasons it was faintly humiliating that i should be suspect for no better reason than the accident of my skin color then unexpectedly i began to move in my white western culture and so to discover for the first time that it was a prison and not the universe the movement was involuntary and as sudden as an optical trick when a prismatic picture in an instant assumes a different perspective and will not resume its former appearance no matter how hard one stares at it i went out into the street one morning and the crowd of passing white faces were strange faces that i saw for the first time without relation to myself their color the shape of their features was alien and unattractive i sought the occasional negro faces that now looked the way faces ought to look faces that could have some relation to me the faces of strangers in a crowd have never resumed their former perspective the white faces are alien the dark ones familiar this new movement within my white western prison has become a small step toward freedom to see to know and to understand a step into an unutterable loneliness for i am estranged from most white people and i know that i can never pass beyond the barrier of color that separates me from even those negro people i love and am close to we reach toward each other across the barrier with love and need knowing it will remain perhaps a friend in harlem where i was living best defined it youre here now with me but you can go back downtown any day you choose neither of us expected i would but we knew i could we knew i could be accepted without question in white communities that would deny him the right to walk down the street beside me i can never begin to pay my dues for they will never be exacted of me he and every other black person in america pay theirs daily their bitter understanding comes high i would be a fool to expect it free another friend told me sometimes i think for a moment that i hate all whites we both knew at those moments i must be not her friend but just another white were we not close she could not have told me this and i could not have accepted it i am in limbo lonely and free and to try to return to the security of my white prison would be impossible and intolerable thus i approach the negro people no longer with compassion or pity for they are stronger and more free than the whites imprisoned in their western culture i am sorrowful and angry at the treatment of negroes but i cannot pity them simply because they are black pity is for inferiors i know now that i need to live in the negro community among the negro people because that is now where i belong i know my need for them is greater than their need for me ever could be this is not to say that black is better than white there is no better or worse i do not now wish i were black but i am profoundly sorry that i have spent most of my life in prison because i am white and i am afraid i shall never be able to forgive my white western culture for lying to me that it was the universe instead of a prison the negro tots in the ghettos are being gathered swiftly into project head start to remedy the supposed cultural lag their ghettoliving has imposed on them how much more deprived are the white tots in the suburbs and how infinitely greater their need for a crash program to free them from their prisons but there will be no program because those who control programs do not acknowledge their world is a prison for me now activity in the civil_rights movement becomes an attempt to be a good citizen in the negro community where i am necessarily the new and ignorant immigrant i know that i will never walk down the street with a black skin and therefore i can never know with my blood and bones what it is to be a negro for this reason i will never attempt to make policy in the civil_rights movement although i will help with what skills i may have my white skin has made me incapable of ever knowing and understanding the negro community well enough to contribute anything worthwhile to basic decisionmaking for this i do not blame myself nor do my negro friends they and i must accept my heritage probably other whites in the civil_rights movement find themselves in this same position some whites i know are masters on the new plantation to them i say and it may seem blunt and cruel as long as you bring your white superiority and paternalism to the civil_rights movement all your good intentions even your courage and sacrifices are useless and offensive to the negro people negroes do not tell you this for most of them are more polite than i and they tolerate you for your good intentions no free men need despots to direct them least of all the negro people who have been used by white despots in america for centuries they do not want to live on your new plantation let the negroes speak and decide they not you know best this time if you can accept this you may one day move beyond your white prison one of the current tenets of political science is the importance of the middle class in maintaining both a democracy and a stable governmental structure this is another classic illustration of confusing that which is created with the act of creation what is importantto democracy and to the permanency of governmentis the struggle to join the middle class and not the existence of the middle class per se the distinction drawn above has serious implications for the future of the negro in american democracyand for the future of that democracy professor nicholas rashevsky has demonstrated that a high degree of conformity may tend to reduce the stability of a political system this supports the contention that maintenance of the status quo the lode star of the conservatives which requires conformity is dysfunctional to democracy those who would support the status quo and maintain our society in a state of equilibrium have failed to recognize that in such a society there is no growth no evolution to quote karl deutsch even a casual reading of de tocquevilles the old regime and the french revolution cannot help but impress one with the fact that the middle class in france had never had it so good as in the years immediately preceding the revolution also that the middle class in contradistinction to the monarchy was adamant in its refusal to include the lower class in the benefits of government it was this impermeability of the middle class in france in russia in italy and in germany which can be seen as the root cause of the rise of the authoritarian regimes which had their genesis in the middle class this also is the prospect facing america today there is a noticeable hardening of the line between those who have and those who havenot the maintenance of this line is the prime concern of conservatives proof of this is seen in the coalition of southern democrats and republican conservatives to scuttle through recommittal all measures designed to ameliorate the conditions of the havenots democracy of all the forms of government is peculiar in possessing a dynamic quality it alone of the worlds political systems possesses the qualities to make it a selfdeveloping or selfenhancing system without this dynamic it would become moribund and be transformed into a static state quickly to wither and disappear this dynamic is derived primarily from one political actthe movement of the lower class into the middle class it is this ferment which provides the changes in governmental actions which prevent the hardening of the arteries of democracy the circular movement of those from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top is an essential characteristic of democracy the american revolution was far more than a fight over taxation without representation it was in essence a revolt against the status quoand more importantly a fight to enter the middle class which englands restrictive commercial policies prevented the colonists from joining the protection of englands rising middle class meant using the colony as a source of raw materials and as a consumer of manufactured goods the result was a revolting development to george iii and the beginnings of a middle class in america the current war on poverty is not designed to effect the functional changes in government which the problems of the poor the young the unemployed and the aged demand as howard k smith said in a recent speech it is inconceivable that the richest nation in the world should have the second highest rate of unemployment of the industrialized nations the poverty program is not empowered to tackle such problems as sources of jobs or an adequate means of livelihood for the aged and those unable to work nor can it tackle such problems as housing and the needed infrastructures of schools libraries community centers and hospitals to name only a few of the deficiencies of our society today in social services as statistics show the united states is falling behind other countries one basic area for example is in the number of hospital beds per capita by the governments own statistics the economy can be kept in balance only by cutting taxes or increasing the budget yet the house district of columbia committee forced an increase in the income tax rate of those below the poverty level no effort is being made to increase public expenditures or to decrease the taxes paid by those for whom the payment means being deprived of food the poverty program however will have an important byproduct and one which its proponents probably did not foresee the programs are aimed at stirring the poor from their lethargy and with that stirring will come a demand for the organic changes which are inherent in the phrase the revolution of rising expectations the ferment for change does not arise in those who have no hope for change or do not see it as benefitting them so this byproduct of a program which was rejected by the coalition of conservatives because it will threaten their ability to maintain the status quo will serve to trigger the demand for more basic changes in the distribution of the benefits of government in the great liberal movement in england in the th century there was a strong connection between the efforts of the nobility to broaden the benefits of government to include the poor and the poors reliance upon the nobility to help them it was this liaison which provided the force behind the political changes which eventually revolutionized politics in england this same force is missing in this country today as a result of this void there is no force operating to moderate change and as a result the government continues to operate as a part of the corporate state this trend has been increasing as we move farther away from the great depression it can be seen in the recent republican cry for more guns and less butter this is a typical tactic to deprive the poor of the benefits of government and to preserve the benefits for those who can afford conspicuous consumption with this trend go all the correlates of lessened democracy more police action decreased protection of the rights of the individual lower taxes on greater incomes and most important the reduced ability of the poor to participate in the decisions of government the desire of the poor to participate is met with a cry of mobocracy significantly the right to vote means little when it is nullified by the imposition of economic sanctions this reduction of the ability of the poor to participate in government is the most damaging attack on democracy for it means a reduced electorate this is the real meaning of the opposition to the civil_rights bill the voting rights bill and the home rule bill for the district of columbia the defeat of home rule for the people in washington means success in a drive to destroy the foundation stone of democracyrepresentation it is an attack on our fundamental belief in local government for if the people in washington are unfit to govern themselves then what large city is capable this is only the latest and most successful attempt to reduce the electorate and to prevent any union between the poor and the believers in democracy for unless the conservatives can succeed in this the benefits of government are apt to be distributed too widely one of the postulates of downs economic theory of democracy is that the economic decisions of a rational government in a democracy are biased against consumers and in favor of producers his reciprocal correlate is that democratic government policies tend to favor lowincome receivers as a class rather than high income receivers consequently because the free market produces a highly unequal distribution of income the more effective democracy becomes politically the greater is government interference with the operation of the economy the conservatives refuse to accept this concomitant result of the free market greater government interference with the economy and a greater distribution of rewards to the low income groups yet as downs points out so clearly it is only with these offsetting actions that democracy can maintain itself and it is with an effective democracy that a majority of the citizens of the united states are concerned when democracy loses its dynamism it developes a state of equilibrium in a state of equilibrium there can be no upward or downward movement of the people society becomes frozen into a status quo in the united states the gap between the haves and the havenots is steadily increasing this too is the condition of the poor countries of the world the gap between them and the few rich countries is widening consequently just as we have not been able to solve our domestic problems so have we not been able to solve our foreign policy problems the ideal of the greek polis was that all citizens participated in government however the viability of the state rested upon a slave economy and the slaves were not citizens one modern political theory that of professor gabriel almond argues that a democracy requires that a proportion of its citizens play no part in government this nonparticipating group or parochials is a cushion which permits government to be managed by a few participants this theory assumes that the participants in government will consider the needs of the nonparticipants equitably no evidence has been brought forth to support this theory professor almond has merely ratified in a theory the status quo as he found it more to the point is carl friedrichs argument that every sane member of the state must be able to be a political person and to take part in the decisions of government without this a democracy degenerates into an oligarchy in name as well as in fact majority rule means little when a large group of people are unable to participate meaningfully in the determination of their fates and today as never before the government does determine the fates of its people if as all the foregoing would seem to indicate we are engaged in a struggle to maintain the status quo and with it to destroy the dynamic of democracy what then can serve to rekindle this essential dynamism it has been suggested previously that this dynamism rests upon the movement into and out of the middle class the largest group to whom the doors of democracy remain closed is the negro hence in a rare bit of paradox it rests upon the former slaves to restore the ideal of the polis to reality while the negro is only a part of those disenfranchised from receiving the benefits of democracy it is upon him that the burden rests to enfranchise everyone it is upon the efforts of the negro to penetrate the middle class that the prevention of a state of equilibrium depends unless equilibrium is prevented democracy will decline into corporatism the concern of the middle class over what the poor will do if they are permitted to better their lot is an old story it was seen in when the congress was considering the fair labor standards act some of the members and many of those testifying against the act were concerned over what the workers would do with their leisure time if they were not forced to work long hours for low pay secretary of labor frances perkins reply to them is as pertinent today as it was then they will do the same things the rich do with their spare time this concern over the morals of the poor if they are no longer so poor can be seen as a reflection of the middle class understanding of its own actions the rise in the divorce rate is a phenomenon of the middle class the poor cannot afford the luxury paradoxically the rise in the crime rate is viewed by those supporting the status quo as another reason why the negro should not agitate to join the middle class yet the negro effort to improve his position is a means of reducing the crime rateif the middle class is free of crime defrauding the federal government through price rigging is obviously a prerogative of the upper middle class so is peddling government influence the industrial revolution beginning after the civil war marked a period of corruption in business and government unequalled in our history this cataclysmic period of rugged change represented an almost wholesale movement to join the middle class the tactics used to suppress the poor then are equalled only by the tactics still used in the south to maintain a cheap labor market it was this violent effort to produce change which remodeled the face of america violence was justified then as defense of property rights those who were successful now decry violence in defense of human rights those bloody years and they continued through the s were in defense of the status quo the right of those who have to have and the denial of the right to all others those were the years which laid the foundation of americas greatness those were dynamic years for the economy if not for democracy the dynamic has gone out of the economy it is continuing to expand but as has been pointed out those at the bottom are sinking lower as the top rises higher there is no servomechanism in a democracy which acts as a governor to brake the decline of the poor they must do this for themselves and the only way they can do it is through agitation to force society to adjust its economic social and political policies so that all will benefit equitably in the proceeds of democracy the imperatives of democracy are many but none is more basic than that summed up in the phrase to promote the general welfare it is enshrined in our constitution as a fundamental tenet to which all who believe in the constitution must subscribe recently the executive director of the international association of police chiefs said we are tired of the cry that because one segment of our population has been deprived for years the balance of society must accept years of anarchy the director is of course confused to struggle to participate in a democracy is not anarchy it is only to seek to perpetuate the existence of that democracy certainly this means upsetting the equilibrium of society just as society was upset during the industrial revolution when the great bulk of the middle class was being formed the great danger to democracy as history plainly shows is when there is equilibrium and the frustration of change our problem today is not to worry about achieving complete democracy our problem is to keep striving for it how are we to advance democracy the answer would seem to lie in the negroin his determination to participate in all the aspects of democracy this means as watts has shown a disequilibrium in society and the safeguarding of democracy since the supreme court decisionalmost twelve years ago declared integration of schools in the united states to be the law of the land it is necessary to consider an aspect which flows from this decision namely the need for and progress toward integration of the materials of learning and teaching this refers to lesson plans teaching units textbooks graphs charts pictures and audio and visual aids it should be evident that integration in education is not achieved by merely permitting negro and white children to sit together in the same classrooms or to attend the same schools an examination of the learning materials which have been in use is in order they too should be imbued with the same democratic concept which brought forth the historic decision if the negro child is short changed by being set apart in a segregated school it is found that he has been doubly harmed when the teaching materials are examined relative to their treatment of him in general either there is slight reference or complete omission of the negros cultural and historical contribution or such materials are ridden with misconceptions stereotypes and slanting distortions such treatment only serves to strengthen the white majority in their superiority attitude while the negro minority is led further into accepting the myth of inferiority naturally these learning materials reflect the attitude of the society in which we live the writers of these materials and those who produce them have been reluctant to admit that negroes have made any real contribution to the history or culture of the united states or to world civilization for that matter why have the contributions of the negro been ignored or distorted in our learning materials because the truth i submit would be a direct refutation of the philosophy of white supremacy which is prevalent in our country the history and culture of the negro has been presented in terms of a people who are passive stupid and incapable of creative efforts this has been reflected in the thinking and writing of many eminent historians and textbook writers unfortunately this point of view has been mirrored in curriculums texts and learning materials through the years for this reason not only has the negro citizenry been denied truth knowledge training and skills but white america has been deprived of an appreciation of the contributions of a large segment of their fellow citizens thus the white child grows into adulthood with a sense of false superiority based on the color of his skin alone he feels that he does not have to try that all he has to do is to be white this concept ends in rude disillusionment and mental upsets when persons with this outlook come face to face with the realities of life when the truth is presented these people will find that all peoplewhite yellow red and yes blackhave made worthwhile contributions to society civilization and american life and history and have helped to make a better life for all mankind they will find that there is no room in the life of an intelligent and cultured person for prejudice and racism a correct portrayal of the contributions of the negro to american history in textbooks and teaching materials will not only benefit the negro child but the white child will be the richer if this information is made available to him he will receive a realistic concept of the contributions of anglosaxons to society civilization and the building of the united states previously his conception of his role in society has been distorted principally to bolster the theory of white supremacy just as the negro child from infancy has been given false impressions so also has the white child the biased presentation of his cultural contribution has harmed the negro child in many ways there is a direct connection between the question of a positive image for the negro american and the programs to aid the poverty stricken and culturally deprived negroes are culturally deprived and poverty stricken in the sense that they are lacking in knowledge of self the millions of dollars appropriated to combat these conditions in our country might well go down the drain unless this question of identity positive self image heritage negro historycall it what you willis faced up to only through a positive reorientation on this matter will the negro american regain his dignity of fourhundred years standing in his country a bit closer to home however the problem of school drop outs among negro youth is closely related to this question school systems all over the country are grappling with this problem has it occurred to the counselors and community workers on behalf of such programs that there is a kinship between school drop outs especially in the case of negro students and the absence of positive knowledge regarding the negro in learning materials we cannot expect the negro child to have positive images to identify with if he is seldom presented with a positive image the void is not only evident in the books he reads but is equally apparent in the pictures and films he sees and in the stories he is told about people who have made heroic contributions from nursery school through college he is confronted with a black black outa brainwashing that says in a hundred different ways whites achieve and progress and blacks do not and of course he is able to observe that the color bias operates in a manner to make it possible for whites to realize their aspirations on their merit ability or talent and to thwart and frustrate blacks with ambition denied knowledge of the participation of his people in the building of the united states and the fulfillment of the american dream the negro child grows up lacking a true sense of his own worth and future potential believing that he is nothing and knowing nothing from nothing leaves nothing he fails to aspire herein are some of the real roots of a negro school drop out failing to receive a sense of pride in accomplishment identity and belonging such young people may well lose faith in their democratic heritage this further emphasizes the need for a reexamination of learning materials in respect to the true contributions of the negro this gap in the education of negro youth must be filled his pride in the accomplishment of his forebears will instill confidence in the future inspired with meaningful examples after which they might pattern their lives negro youth will enrich the entire american society with their deeds integration of the materials of teaching and learning will not only enrich the school population of the country but will delineate the full intent of the supreme court decision this calls for additional research and much revision and rewriting the path of least resistance is to refuse to recognize the problem and to continue in the old way with the biased materials and the conventional and accepted outlook but how long can we keep our heads buried in the sand throughout this country there is a clamor from integrationists and civil_rights groups for school systems to do something about the inclusion of the teaching of negro history they mean by this the integration of teaching materials their demands are proper and few school boards or systems would disagree however lacking from these groups are practical suggestions for the implementation of their demands a school board or system is faced with certain questions are current texts and materials to be junked revised or rewritten is socalled negro history true american history to be taught in predominantly negro schools or in all of the schools will the publishers or producers of such materials take the initiative to provide them for the school systems or will the school systems have to create and produce their own materials the solution to the problem is intricate but it is not unsolvable herein will be found exciting work for historians textbook and juvenile writers curriculum and guidance workers teachers and last but not least publishers and producers of these materials since heretofore such little attention has been paid to these materials many will have to be ereated the missing pages of history relating to the negro will have to be written into units lesson plans readers language and historical texts they will have to be diagramed and drawn into pictures charts films film strips and recorded onto tapes and records since only an infinitesimal amount of this material is available school systems themselves may well have to take the responsibility of producing their own materials if the publishers fail to provide it committees of teachers administrators and specialists in the field of negro literature and history might be appointed to review and make recommendations for positive changes and additions to texts curriculums courses of study learning units and teaching materials their aim should be to reflect the positive contributions not only of the negro to society civilization and american history but of other ethnic groups who have been neglected or ignored as a result of such surveys school systems could then inform the publishers of what they wish to have included in the materials which they purchase or they may endeavor to produce their own materials similarly to what has been done in detroit washington dc and new york city such a program will be costly but the price of educational and cultural deprivation must be paid if we wish to bolster and protect our democracy the nation will not only be enriched but it will be doubly reimbursed if it brings out of this period of turbulent social strife a proud united new generation of american youth the white youth cognizant of and respectful of their negro fellow citizens the negro youth a proud american who has found his identity the needs are obvious if through our inaction we render ourselves helpless in the face of this great challenge it is almost certain that we also will render ourselves helpless toward making the american dream more than just a dream in his powerful work i the wretched of the earth which has been called a revolutionary bible frantz fanon made this brilliant observation now the fellah the unemployed man the starving native do not lay a claim to the truth they do not say that they are the truth for they are the truth fanons words were written with direct reference to the masses of natives visavis the native intellectual or the native who had adopted the forms of thought of the colonialist bourgeoisie at the time of the writing fanon was one of the most articulate spokesmen for the algerian revolution but inherent in fanons writings was a profound concern for oppressed blacksthe colonized the world over including this land that he described as a former european colony that decided to catch up with europe according to fanon it succeeded so well that the united states of america became a monster in which the taints the sickness and the inhumanity of europe have grown to appalling dimensions it is interesting to note that his early death of cancer which occurred on these shores might possibly have been avoided had he not feared coming to this country for treatment a bit ironic perhaps but his fears were not so unreal nor were they based on myth for they are the truthso simple so mighty and so many implications and the fellah fanon spoke of very definitely inhabits this land and he isin this land no less the truth than in fanons adopted algeria we have for so many years attempted to avoid him to not see him and upon seeing him we have pretended that we did not but we know who the fellah is in this country but the fellah in recent times has forced us to look at him to see him and he has made it increasingly difficult for us to deny his pres ence and his condition moreover he has forced us to listen to him to hear himalbeit our response to him more often than not makes one wonder we have seen him erupt in harlem and watts and we heard him through the voice of brother malcolmand to think that malcolm did not speak for the fellah simply because they were not card carrying followers is really not to think at all let us for our purposes define the chosen ones quite simply those blacks among us who in words actions inaction and indifferenceand we know who we arelay a claim to the truth the fellah also knows who we are after all we are so easily identified but the marks of identification that come to mind are not so superficial as the clothes we wear or the houses we live in more precisely the chosen ones are given to a pattern of thought and reflex that is indeed pronounced one of the more obvious marks of identity of the chosen ones is the predictable nature of their telling comments on the fellah the chosen ones comments on the fellah for the most part lack validity and are often quite unintelligent although the chosen ones think themselves rather learnedhowever they are indeed telling to be sure they are telling about ourselves another mark of identity is the chosen ones reactions to the fellahhis words his actions and his very existence the right to which is often challenged by the reactionary nature of the chosen ones but alas the chosen ones manage to sympathize with the fellah when he rebels or do they perhaps it is more accurate to say that the chosen ones experience a vicarious orgasm of the soul when the fellah rebels for you see in a very real sense the fellah is rebelling for the chosen ones who with such painful ramifications have conceded the right to rebel for the right to be among the chosen ones the right to serve the guardian and the guardian of course is the white man and to elaborate on the exceptions is to indulge in futile exercise whitey is the guardian who not out of kindness or brotherhood or any such myth but out of intense fear has taken upon himself the chosen ones in a desperate attempt to protect himself from the fellah with unequaled resolve he has designed in this valley of rampant timidity a peculiar niche wherein the chosen ones reside in all their misery and the suffering of the chosen ones is apparent for many reasons paramount among the reasons for their misery is the inescapable fact that in each of the chosen ones there dwells some fellah that same fury is cradled in his psyche that same desperation buried in the pit of his belly but unlike the fellah when his emotions demand that he rebel his debt to the guardianthose special dues of the chosen onesdemands that he repress although the indoctrination of the chosen ones has insured certain mechanical reactions to given situations involving the fellah his emotions do not and perhaps cannot respond to this specific indoctrination emotionally the chosen one remains a fellah hence his emotional response is in direct conflict with his physical response resulting in a vicious paradox witness the language of the chosen ones within the confines of safety they will talk of things being soulful nitty gritty and funky but they will unfailingly avoid this ethnic behaviour whenever the atmosphere suggests that their place might be jeopardized in the presence of the guardian the chosen one is allowed to act like a fellah only if the guardian is acting like a fellahand exceptions to this rule are extremely rare let the fellah choose the wrong time and place to become emotional or funky and witness the chosen ones squirm and cringe as their roots become like terrible scorching fires a young black lady a very chosen one who in her words belongs to a very high class church recently conveyed the following incident to me one sunday morning in the presence of a white friend she turned on the tv only to be confronted with the spectacle of a negro church service where they fellahs one guesses were carry ing on she confided that it made her very ashamed i inquired why and asked her if there was something wrong with people praising their god in their way she allowed that there was really nothing wrong with it but that she just thought we should keep such things to ourselves it is rather interesting that she a chosen one should use the pronoun we but nevertheless not at all surprising for even the most catholic episcopal unitarian or what have you among the chosen ones cannot avoid identification with the holy rollers although in complete control of the physical characteristics or manifestations of the fellah in themselves the chosen ones are unable to contain its inevitable rise and at its mildest the fellah in them is much more baptist than catholic but through further questioning i discovered there was much more to her shame it seems that her white friends head drooped at the spectacle alas embarrassed of course the chosen ones obligation to protect the guardian is at that precise moment primary what follows might well be described as emotional prostitution it is sad enough that the chosen ones bag requires that they stand before the guardian begging for that thing called freedom but what is even more sad is that they think it their responsibility to free the guardian from the selfinflicted psychologythe guiltthat makes a guardians head droop at the sight of those uninhibited holy rolling fellahs and the head droopers and their would be saviours in their collective misery are seemingly incapable of reasoning that if the fellah did not spend all that precious time holy rolling it is quite possible that he would spend it making molotov cocktailsand there are those who would suggest that the production of such might produce more real christians than all of the high class churches have managed to produce to date in this land each of us who has at some juncture played the role of the chosen onewhether by choice or circumstancecan recall at least one cringing experience about ten years ago while riding a bus en route to school a shabbily dressed black man sat next to me he proceeded without apparent qualm to pull out a hamburgerand began feasting well it so happened that there was a shortage of brothers on that bus but there were many guardians present now lets face it if that had been a bus full of brothers i probably would have said something like dig baby my mans goin for himselfwhich translated is like proclaiming the cat soulful or something similarand my emotions would have been quite safe at any rate i would not have been embarrassed by such an incident on a bus full of brothersand what brother would have been but with all those guardians present and my head filled with all that phenomena that once passed as values i did what all good chosen ones would have done then and still do today i squeezed against the side of the bus face flush against the window and did my damndest to pretend that either i or my hamburger eating brother the fellah did not exist and that the incident was not really happening what choice did i have how else might i have preserved the pride of the chosen ones and whats a squashed nose when so much is at stake but and i find this very sad it was perhaps four or five years later before i was finally able to question my reaction to the incident before i began to understand it on that harsh day it was so simple for me to condemn the fellah for causing me such great pain he caused me pain well blinded by the cruel plight of the chosen ones i certainly thought he did after all i would not have eaten a hamburger on a bus well perhaps on a bus full of brothers maybe and therefore it was wrongcertainly not very cultured is that not the usual method employed by the chosen ones to condemn the fellahi would not have done it i suggest that such was indeed the usual method and it remains so and the guardians have bestowed upon the chosen ones that great rationale for such godplaying exercisesvalues and culture the chosen ones have acceptedfor better or for worse the values of the guardian and they have no other choice short of abdicating their curious status and the products of this tormenting marriage both the chosen ones and the guardian have the unadulterated arrogance to subject the fellah to those values in a manner that is perhaps without precedent as one mans brazen declaration of superiority over another year after year after year they persist with inimitable audacity in demanding that the fellah respect uphold and keep sacred those dubious values which have to this date in this land served the fellahs interest not one damn bit the result of this vile web the condition of american life today that which all the surveys are about rather compels one to search and search for a rationale that will deem the guardian and the chosen ones something other than the most merciless duo to ever inhabit the earth but the web is so full of lies and the search alas is in vain moreover the accusersthose who deny the fellahs humanity by condemning him for the sins they have committed against him claim the right to their vicious undertaking they have manipulated the teachings of their high class churches so as to defendtheir incredible impositions and judgments on the grounds of a strange barren morality but it is no secret that they are not half as vehement in their efforts to make of themselves and their values something worth respecting the distorted nature of their morality can be witnessed for example in their pretentious inability throughout americas citiesto persecute slum landlords with the same tenacious will that they have employed all these years in their persecution of the very people whose stench degradation and deaths will forever haunt the souls of those same landlords this is but one example of the horror of the american double standard that one might depict ad infinitum and such is the noble status of the sons and daughters of the chosen ones and the guardian and the fellah is hep to them and they know it but the chosen ones cloak their guilt with all the affectations of the catalogue culture and its peculiar dignity what is more american than mail order houses and catalogues you see it you want it you order it its yours you have a lifetime to pay for it and in all probability it isnt worth a damn but everyone has one so so it is the same with the culture that is valued by the chosen ones who have received from the guardian with his blessings the catalogue which carries with it the right to order those things deemed necessary by the guardian to insure complete control of the chosen ones anyone given the opportunity can grasp all that jazz that is at once a claim to fame and the source most often used to deny the fellahs humanity it is just as easy as that it is nothing more than a catalogue culture all one really needs is the catalogue but the cultured ones have not yet proved that they have the basic decencyin spite of brotherhood weekto share the catalogue with the fellah a fact which implies that they are somehow terribly afraid that the fellah might pass the course in six easy lessons quite like they did before him and no longer would the chosen ones and the guardian loom so mighty in their timid makebelieve minds for as fanon so wisely observed the fellah is the truthabout the rest of us if we are fortunate the nature of love and hate being so entwined perhaps the fellah will eventually save us from ourselves to expect the fellah to join this fraternity of hypocrisy and selfdeception at this late date is to believe in miracles this dreary coalition has conspired to starve men and has sealed the conspiracy with faith hope charity good intentions and a yet unfound democracy but time has worked against us and caught us naked for the masses of victims to joinnowwould be to defy human nature fanon suggested come then comrades we must find something different and the fellah willit is only a matter of time but what hope is there for the chosen ones and the guardian perhaps the starting point is to look at ourselves to finally question our existence in another country through the voice of the preacher sermonizing over the dead rufus a suicide victim james baldwin spoke profoundly and i tell you something else dont none of you forget it i know a lot of people done took their own lives and theyre walking up and down the streets today and some of them is preaching the gospel and some is sitting in the seats of the mighty now you remember that if the world wasnt so full of dead folks maybe those of us thats trying to live wouldnt have to suffer so bad and he was notwhen he spoke of dead folkstalking about the fellah the negroes around parisespecially the younger more swinging oneshave found a new sport which like bullfighting is often bloody and more than a little cruel theres an american governmental employee around town who everyone assumes is an agent of the cia central intelligence agency the man makes himself known to all the brothers and proceeds to feel them out relative to their opinions on say vietnam and santo domingo and the race war back home not only that but he asks for all the details of personal life and history such as place of birth university attended etc and it is difficult not to imagine him scurrying back to his apartment to write all this information in his dossiers after a session with some particularly effusive subject well the negroes just put him on something awful they tell him all kinds of wild things and sometimes they sound like theyre ready to take up arms and fight against la patrie the government man offers all kinds of reasons why america is not so badthings are so much better than they were or many white people are now helping the negroes or negroes have more cars and refrigerators than all the french peopleand he always seems genuinely surprised that no negro agrees with him and when he is asked about all the violence and discrimination directed against negroes at home the government mans standard reply goes something like this well its better than russia you can still try to change things in america but you cant change things in russia but who said anything about russia well its there in the back of the government mans head and out it comes russia communism china but baby you dont have to worry about communism so much if you make democracy work one refugee from the civil_rights wars told the government man but it didnt sink in nothing seems to sink in really the government man just keeps going from negro to negro collecting his data and being put on and nothing changes the mans ego must be shielded by a tough armor of patriotism not to be ripped to shreds by all the subtle ridicule and hostility he encounters but alas perhaps the bearing of such a burden was an important aspect of his training in intelligence out of simple humanity one hopes so his is a totally unrewarding job for all that information on the dossiers wont change a single fact about racism in america and its destructive effect on black americans at a recent los angeles conference cosponsored by the american textbook publishers institute and the great cities research council the major subject of discussion was the representation or lack of same of racial and ethnic minorities in the textbooks used in urban education dr evelyn f carlson associate superintendent of the chicago public schools had this to say the materials available now are fine and tremendous the publishers have come a long way dr everett chaffee associate superintendent of the los angeles public schools contributed the following five years ago we were critical now were aware of the lead time publishers need in the past year or year and onehalf material has come on the market dealing with these issues of racial and minority groups im not so worried about this area right now this in spite of evidence to the contrary in a recent saturday review article the allwhite world of childrens books nancy larrick former president of the international reading association stated across the country nonwhite children are learning to read and to understand the american way of life in books which either omit them entirely or scarcely mention them there is no need to elaborate upon the damagemuch of it irreparableto the negro childs personality it is no secret that chicago lags far behind other large cities in making progress in this area also we are laboring under the assumption that watts is a part of los angeles with this in mind we cant help wondering who the two educators propose to represent when they claim that things are fine and tremendous and there is no cause to worry it was at the breakfast table in messel a quiet german village near darmstadt that we read the report on last aprils writers conference at the new school in new york in the latest issue of the new school bulletin it first had been published in a japanese review was reprinted in the bulletin and the copy at hand had been mailed to our german host from new york by its author gloria oden an american negro poeteditorlawyer our first reaction to the report was one of sadness not merely because we had seen the writers conference differently in conception and effect but also because we felt the author did not understand the banality and futility of her propositionthat for all practical purposes she was at least a generation behind the times for she was critical of the negro writers at the conference for their refusal to seize the opportunity of a receptive predominantly white audience to seek to persuade them to the writers cause she saw the chance for the establishment of a dialogue and she felt the negro writers had turned their backs had instead resorted to complaints accusations and emotionalism and she proposed that ideally the negro writers should have adopted a more conciliatory pose one has to grant miss oden the possession of seriousness and concern these values at least she shares with the writers she opposes she wishes that the idea of race which divides americans would cease to exist as a problem and she apparently feels that negro writers can help in diminishing the problem by ceasing to emphasize their differences miss oden admits the catalogue of wrongs the negro people endure at the hands of their white compatriots but she would make much of the fact that negro writers and intellectuals spring from a class less affected by these wrongs and she suggests that these writers and intellectuals also have the duty to confront the significance of their privileged status she seems to be reminding the creators of the angry and bitter black characters in recent novels and plays by negroes that there also exist happy black millionaires and even lawyers editors and scientists with life patterns which do not conform to those depicted in the novels and plays it is an argument as tragically shortsighted and ultimately irrelevant as it is old the house slave always emphasized his superiority over the field slave without altering one iota the reality of his condition the paper bag negro elites assumed high caste and social standing without ever losing the stigma or evading the limitations imposed by in irving chapmans novel the man there is a negro writer named leroy who begins each day with an exercise in hating whites at the end of his novel the system of dantes hell grove press leroi jones says if we can bring back on ourselves the absolute pain our people must have felt when they came onto this shore we are more ourselves again and can put history back in our menu and forget the propaganda of devils that they are not devils in this book leroi jones brings back the pain of childhood and youth in chapters which are supposed to correspond to the circles of dantes hell where sinners are tormented for their sins jones prose does not have the sinewy clear terse direct quality of dantes verse the scenes in some of his chapters do not correspond to the sins of those in the matching circles of dantes hell the early chapters are fragmentary they contain random disconnected memories of childhood these may be interesting to a psychiatrist but not to a reader of a novel looking for a story who is not concerned with administering therapy or with interpreting free associations the corner is old headlight bubbles now look for the lies them now they go away these lovers for my running those soft flies over the shortstops head please not as a dead man even diane a fair second baseman you let him die no the lies no the later chapters have more narration they tell of a gang fight at a party an attempted massrape of a syphilitic prostitute the seduction of a boy by his army buddy and his rape by his tent mates and the seduction of the boy by a prostitute in a southern town when you consider the chief character you find that he doesnt have it so bad he is a middleclass negro a class to which leroi jones belongs and which he despises lightskinned which the character seems to find desirable bigandprettyeyed athletic and respected and feared by his peers for his precocious intelligence his skill in the dozens and his sarcasm there is more real misery privation and pain in the childhood accounts of claude brown dick gregory gordon parks horace clayton than here richard wright in black boy paints a more convincing picture of a milieu that induces real frustration and rage selby in last exit to brooklyn presents a more terrifying hell it is with his poets skill with words that leroi jones creates the atmosphere of hell in spite of some faddish eccentricities of style punctuation and spelling which he would do well to discard i dont think there is a single cliche in the book jones achieves this depressing atmosphere with his images of stinks greyness ugliness with his broken sentences his stumbling rhythms gone is the innocence of tom sawyer and huckleberry finn innocence despite the come back to the raft huck honey of leslie fiedler who hysterical as a member of the john birch society sees a homosexual or an oversexed negro under every bed the book that this most calls to mind is jean toomers cane both books were written by poets in an evocative style but the mood is different cane has the joy of discovery of the peasant soil of the south and bursts forth into wonderful poems joness book has a malaise of the urban north and abounds with references to copulation masturbation and fellatio this is a minor work of a talented writer he will do better when he grows more mature harlem is the most surveyed researched storied chronicled and publicized neighborhood in the world yet each year we see a new stream of books articles pamphlets and newsprint coming from that ghetto of color perched atop manhattan the reason for this and the continued interest in harlem is because no one book or collection of books has been able to arrive at a definitive work on harlem gibbons rise and fall of the roman empire did this for a phenomenon as great and as geographically diverse as rome but no one has been able to approach anything similar for harlem perhaps the reason for this is found in the very fact that harlemwhat it is and representsutterly defies definition perhaps harlem is like fire we know what elements go into making it we know what conditions exist to make its existence possible we know the effects it can have and the things it can do to and for people but we do not know what it is in substance any book that uses harlem as a background or point of departure is already limited from the outset to capturing just a small portion of the essence of harlem harlem is every conceivable thing to every conceivable mentality this is not an original idea regarding cities but in harlem its true in spades pun intended bird at my window lippincott philadelphia is a very sensitive engaging challenging novel by rosa guy it reveals the gradual amoralization of a black man in harlem in doing so miss guy demonstrates an enviable skill in relating the sociological and psychological forces that cause this phenomenon because she does so without preaching or philosophizing equally skillful is the subtle manner she employs to get her points across to the reader it helps if the reader knows harlem however it is essential that the reader know negro ghetto life to get the full understanding and appreciate the real talent gently at work here miss guy does not tell us anything new about harlem that is not her mission what she does is to relate an interesting story and the psychological metamorphosis of a black man in harlem caught up in the matriarchy mores and manipulation common to black america the book for all of its positive values does suffer in several aspects the dialogues sometimes fail to ring true unlikely and falsesounding words and phrases come out of very unlikely mouths at times the book lags but that might be attributed to the impatience of the reader to get on which is something of an indirect compliment to the author with bird at my window we can score another triumph for harlem harlem has produced a continuum of talent dating back to the times before the black renaissance of the twenties for despite the poverty horror and shame harlem stands for the chain of talented writers has been unbroken from hughes through wright baldwin and claude brown miss guy is on the threshold of adding another link to that impressive chainbrooks johnson i when the united states sent marines into the dominican republic last spring did it act out of selfish interest and against the people of that country most people who answer yes to that question are called radical and perhaps rightly so santo domingo revolt of the damned g p putnams sons reveals the inside truth of the dominican republicpast and presentas seen by washington post correspondent dan kurzman a prize winning journalist who has been covering foreign affairs for almost two decades and who cannot be so easily dismissed by using the tag radical the book includes a brief history of the dominican republic and a candid account of our involvement there the pure barbarism of trujillo the latin american hitleris displayed as well as the undeniable fact that we supported him for years the author describes young rebels in the dominican republic as militantly nationalist and fervently antiamerican with the restlessness and dissatisfaction that characterize youth in most underdeveloped countries scarred by past colonial or totalitarian exploitation and the author has seen most such countries but why this antiamericanism what kind of government or family did we support under trujillo there was the mass murder of to haitian residentsno one is certain of the figureduring one hour period in trujillo with our support managed to obtain control of more than of the nations wealth with the remainder going to a handful of partners in his crimes while the populace suffered the trujillo family ended up owning of the nations sugar plantations of its sugar mills of its best land and compiled a fortune estimated at over million the tortures used against his foes and anyone who thought he was less than god was an enemyincluded nail extractors decapitation collars leather thonged whips and various electrical devices but as author kurzman points out trujillo was a good friend of the united states after all he paid off his countrys foreign debts always voted the right way in the oas and un kept the streets clean put communists in jail and knew how to keep order in a country that was not ready for democracy juan bosch the man who was overthrown while bringing democracy to the dominican republicdefeated because we refused to help himalso comes through in this book he comes through as a man with many political shortcomings but nevertheless as a man who believed in democracy and was dedicated to his people author kurzman assesses boschs failures but history will be hard pressed to find one greater than his belief and trust in the united states one cannot neglect the history of the dominican republic and expect to understand the situation in that country today author kurzman in this excellently written and well documerited book brings the truth before our eyes he proves that one can be anticommunism and antiadministration policy although there are those who would find that inconceivable it is noteworthy that the author mentions that most of the poor oppressed persecuted victims of tyranny in the dominican republic just happen to belong to the darker race the author would prefer and this is his right to think that our policy in the dominican republic has been a case of blundering but how long can such blundering persist it is left to the readers subjective conclusion whether we are really so blundering or maybe as history rather suggests we are just plain antipeople especially certain peopledavid llorens aristotle called him a madman plato thought he was indeed a thing ethereally lightwinged and sacred the dark ages looked upon him as supernatural and primitive cultures even today regard him with an awe reserved for the gods whatever he was in the past however the artist today is certainly one of the least defined members of society whether writer musician painter sculptor actor director choreographer or related practitioner the artistically inclined person is a strange bird indeed in a world committed to functionalism in a new clinical study the artist in society problems and treatment of the creative personality grove press psychiatrist lawrence j hatterer presents a longneeded analysis of this grossly misunderstood minority because of his work way of life and status in society writes the author the artist has problems peculiar to himself unlike those whose work is not closely bound up with their inner life an artists emotional experience is central to his achievement dr hatterer who has analyzed thousands of artistpatients over the last seven years confines his discussion to those problems distinguishing artists from other patients these include the artistic ego professional rejection creative work blocks fallow periods the need for isolation and consequent loss of meaningful relationships resentments stemming from nonrecognition both by the public and intimates lack of a concrete occupational identity conflict in values with the outside world and others in addition the study clears up some of the timeworn stereotypes regarding the artist including the spurious assumption perpetuated by romantic biographies that creative impulse and mental derangement are one and the same clinical evidence does not support the linkage of genius with insanity dr hatterer asserts rather such evidence contradicts this because in psychosis the artists work is severely impaired however the book does often seem to imply that most artists away from their work have difficulty functioning in society from what we know of the lives of dante shakespeare bach haydn and others as well as latterday artists in all fields it is evident that the human mind can somehow operate both superficially and in those strange trackless regions where art lives there must come a time in the creative sensibility when the world around it seems shallow indeed but most geniuses seem able to descend again and take part in that world often in its most banal pursuits indeed the creative instinct it seems to me defies analysis its very existence implies the nonrational the mystic still for practicing therapists not oriented in the psyche of the artist the book will doubtless prove enlightening for artists themselves it will certainly be of therapeutic valuehamilton bims every historical event has a very vital causal connection with the past such a historic event is the culmination of a series of pertinent factors that have preceded the actual event in question to fully understand the occurrence we must know what the pertinent facts are behind and before the occurrence itself the entering of james meredith into the university of mississippi is probably one of the most completely covered and documented of modern events certainly no other college activity has ever received such publicity andor notoriety so any book that merely rakes over these old coals is not really likely to make much of a contribution but walter lords the past that would not die harper and row discusses merediths entrance into ole miss and does make a contribution the reason for this is that he has gone deep into mississippi history and provided us with sociological economical and political facts that directly relate to what happened in oxford during those historic days to this extent he provides the reader with background information to better understand the factors and forces at work there this is the second of two books i have read inspired by merediths enrollment at ole miss the other james silvers mississippi the closed society was also quite heavy in historic background and as a result things that previously were vague and void of meaning took on clarity as a result of reading the book lords book is similar in what it does but he does extend ones understanding of mississippi history a bit differently from silver but putting this aside another area in which the book makes a rather clean incisive and definitive point is the manner in which it dispenses with the old idea that time takes care of everything the idea in question can be posed if mississippi and the south had had more time would they have gradually corrected their own problems mr lord provides us with almost indisputable evidence to the contrary for example he points out that things of the south have not really changed much since civil war days the following is a quote from about mississippi the respectable people of the state do not discourage the practice of carrying arms by whites as they should they are astonishingly tolerant of acts which would arouse a northern community to the utmost a willingness to see men take the law into their own hands and what is still worse to let them openly defy the laws without losing apparently the respect of the community but lord does not rely upon the fact that the quote in question could have just as easily been made in he goes on to statistically make his point the trouble was more time all too often meant that the negro simply drifted further back when mississippi tightened its voting qualifications in it was argued that negroes were not ready since were illiterate by less than were illiterate but fewer negroes than ever were allowed to register and further nor did more time mean more money for negro education in negro teachers average a month in the figure was moreover we find that in the state of mississippi spent three times as much on white education as for negroes in the ratio was the same so we clearly see that in mississippi separate never was equal and there never was any intention on the part of white mississippians that it should be that way the book is very engaging and informative it is written in a very easy readable style with each point put forth realistically and scholarly supported the meat is in the factual and statistical presentation of facets of mississippi history that shed light and meaning on mississippi today and the fact that they are almost hopelessly chained to the past that would not die back in antiquity there was a saying that is still very much with us today the saying is render unto caesar that which is caesars and render unto god that which is gods this was a tacit assumption of that fact that there was to be a split between the secular and spiritual realms politicians were to minister to the secular realm and churchmen to the spiritual realm even then there were great conflicts between politician and pope the two swords doctrine manifested in the above quote which was a source of conflict down through the ages still lingers with us of late it is demonstrated in the conflict that goes on within the minds and souls of religious leaders today in the area of civil_rights just how much should a clergyman concern himself with the secular movement of negroes into the street to protest how involved should be get in the basic mundane struggle of black people to leave the ghetto and throw off their ghettorization for negro ministers this has often proven to be a thorny question with no fast and sure answer for many white ministers it has proven to be a question that they have refused to meet head on and have attempted to ignore it whenever and wherever possible but there is a discernible change in their reaction to the civil_rights movements more and more white ministers are coming to the front lines some assuming roles of leaders but david reimers white protestantism and the negro oxford university press is not so much concerned with what the various white christian leaders are doing but rather my purpose is to provide the historical perspective for viewing what they are doing it is perhaps too shopworn to repeat that the most segregated hour in america is sunday morning from eleven to twelve when america is worshipping this is a very provocative and pitiful paradox mr reimers book does help to understand how this blightful fact got to be such understanding the background does not of course cure the ailment but it does provide us with a basis for making intelligent diagnosis and the ultimate application of preventive measures to this end mr reimers book furnishes us with a valuable piece of literature it is perhaps necessarily incomplete because this is not the kind of subject that lends itself to a definitive treatment it is easy and intelligible reading and will give the reader certain historical insights into whys and hows of american white christianity and its relationship to american black people this is what the author sets out to do and after some pages you get the impression that he has succeeded cathedrals of france beacon press has as its illustratorauthor auguste rodin it is a handsome giftoriented englishlanguage edition of a book first published in france in the text and drawings in the page book with an index of place names were taken from the notebook of the famed sculptorarchitect who apparently was fascinated by cathedrals and received inspiration from studying them the great mans descriptions reflections and impressions are enthralling and translator elisabeth c geissbuhle has captured the nuances and flavor of a fine witty and deeply humane intellect in the note to the original french edition the publishers presented rodins writing and sketches as uniquely the work of an artist that we present to the public of an artist whose sense of beauty none will contest no attempt was made to reorganize the artists musings to place them in some order he had not himself devised the dozens of renderings are scattered throughout the book one set of wellknown edifices grouped into a portfolio in the center of the book the writing is often poetically evocative i am one of the last witnesses of a dying art the love that inspired it is spent the marvels of the past slip into oblivion nothing replaces them and soon we shall be in the night frenchmen are hostile to the treasures of beauty that glorify their race and with no one to guard these treasures they strike them they break them out of hatred or ignorance or by stupidity or under pretext of restoring they dishonor them those who like rodin love the inspired architecture represented by some of the old cathedrals of europe will want to see and readand keepcathedrals of france the awakenings of africa are numerous and many are lost with that part of history that is conveniently listed as unrecorded it is refreshing to read a book that makes an admirable attempt at recording parts of the more recent political awakening of africa rupert emerson and martin kilson have coedited an interesting book entitled the political awakening of africa prenticehall new jersey the method of chronicling this more recent awakening is to collect the speeches of some of africas leading nationalists and leaders starting back with j e casely hayford and felix eboue and their special brand of nationalism and continuing down to more current leaders and their brand of african political nationalism the book is outstanding for what is included and the light that it sheds on the basic thinking of african leaders some years ago the book points to the former african desire to better conditions within the existing framework of political domination by for eign powers the goal of these early leaders was to convince the ruling powers that the african was worthy of better treatment on one hand and to make the african more deserving and faithful to the colonial country on the other as stated above the book is impressive for what it says but it is also impressive because it does not say as much as one would like hearing the leaders of africa past and present talk about african political problems is a very enlightening and realistic method of understanding what the african thinking and goals really were and the methodology they sought to employ to realize these ends the amount of literary and intellectual salt the reader has to apply to get a full understanding is correspondingly reduced when the subject matter is presented in this fashion the upshot of all this is that one is impressed with what is said and how but really wishes that the authors had given us more while the old theatre axiom always leaving wanting more is good theatre technique the result of the same feeling here is that the reader is left partially pleased but generally frustratedbrooks johnson chester himes the heats on putnams and sons new york tells of the havoc that a misplaced cache of heroin in harlem can cause to do this he uses addicttypes with their full complement of supportive characters sometimes these characters come off and sometimes they dont but himes does manage to keep an element of suspense in the story right up to the very last page he is extremely successful in his attempts at humor this is perhaps the very strong point of the book humor is generally a visual experience and to elicit the kind of humorous response he gets from his use of the printed word demonstrates truly a marvelous talent unfortunately that talent does not obliterate the shortcomings in things such as dialogue and feel the reader is left with the feeling that mr himes would have been better off to have returned to harlem to restudy some of the patterns and vernacular that now are in vogue rather than depending on his memory for things about harlem that were true before he left there for residence in paris harlem is elusive because it is constantly changing and to capture even a minute part one must have uptodate firsthand contact it is easy to discover the fact that mr himes is a talented writer but it is equally apparent that the talent was not uniformly applied in places and things that required extensive hard work we find the author apparently settling for less than his native abilities could produce perhaps if harlem were not so well known to us the book would have been more palatable and believable but the harlem of mr himes does not come off with the reality we have seen in person and read about in the works of some others who strangely enough did not generally appear to have the basic talent that mr himes possesses in his book mr himes fails twice he fails himself and what he is no doubt capable of and he fails harlembrooks johnson chicagos weather report predicted clear skies and a high in the s earlier that same group of visiting french saluted their flag as they proudly

planned to return home dr_king vowed to return again comedians may jest politicians may orate and harried taxpayers may fumebut income taxes are a necessary part of our economic structure income taxes were first imposed in as an emergency measure to meet the expenditures of the civil war repealed in and revived in income taxes left the american scene when declared unconstitutional in the sixteenth amendment to the constitution enacted into law on february gave congress the power to levy and collect taxes on income from all sources without equal apportionment between the states or apportionment based on any census considered a model among tax systems the american tax system has a reputation of being one of the most effective and strongest systems anywhere in the world what is quite unique in our system is that almost billion is collected each year with approximately being collected on a voluntary basis this is the result of the selfassessment system whereby taxpayers in good faith assess themsplves by listing income and deductions and compute tax liability many taxpayers are resentful of the taxbite but by and large people are cognizant of the fact that most countriesboth of the eastern and western blocshave income taxes at higher rates than our own to complain to disagree to petition and to want taxes abolished altogether are an american institution what these antitax proponents know deep down in their hearts is that our system of government could not continue without the revenue derived from income and excise taxes inequities exist in anything human and congressional tax experts are aware that our tax laws are replete with loopholes and opportunities for special interests to pay less than their true share of the tax burden however studies by tax counsellors who work for the nations lawmakers are constantly underway the introduction of electronic data processing is expected to curb the deliberate omissions of taxable dividends interest and other items and to keep a check on dependency exemptions and allowable deductions at times it may not seem to be a privilege to pay taxes without waving the flag realization is a must that the annual federal tax bill is but a small price to pay to be able to live in a nation which has a constitution which embodies so many protections for the rights of its citizens while the treasury department through the internal revenue service wants you to pay your true and full tax liability it does not want you to overpay many taxpayers overpay their taxesunnecessarily or fail to receive refunds for previous overpayments because of faulty penmanship beware of deceiving digits consider the errors that can occur in computing your tax or filling in your forms if your ls s and s all look alike if your s and s appear to be interchangeable if your s and s cannot be told apart illegible numerals are not the only troublemakers each year hundreds of thousands of tax refunds are delayed in reaching claimants because internal revenue clerks cannot decipher names of individuals streets or cities failure to notify the district directors office of a change of address also results in delayed checks and unnecessary correspondence because by law the post office department cannot forward an envelope containing a government check you can save yourself a lot of grief if you approach the preparation of your tax return in an orderly fashion also tax time can be very costly if you neglect to keep a record of deductible expense and wait until the last minute to work on your return and in your haste overlook legitimate deductions on one sheet of paper list the figures from your w forms together with all other sources of income such as fees commissions profits from real estate profits from stocks dividends interest etc make sure that you do not include nontaxable income such as loans gifts compensation insurance proceeds insurance recoveries for injury or sickness etc on another piece of paper list your tax deductible expensescontributions interest casualty losses taxes medical expenses and miscellaneous items now it is time to make a decision which return should you use which method of filing will give you the lower tax to pay or the greater refund if your gross income is or less you can elect to use the tax tables even though you make this election you can still deduct local carfares travel away from home expenses including the cost of meals and lodging which are necessary to your employment when your deductible expenses exceed of your gross income it will pay you to make the election to itemize your deductions on what is known as the longform where your income is over you can elect the standard optional deduction limited to you can list your itemized deductions for taxes interest charity etc or you can elect to use the minimum standard deduction frequently taxpayers will see published tables of average deductions and assume that their returns will not be questioned if what they claim is within the guidelines nothing could be more erroneous a taxpayer can only deduct that amount actually spent which is substantiated by receipted bills or cancelled checks the first draft of the return should be put away for a few days thereafter the return in draft form should be examined for omissions of income or deductible items the return should be checked for mathematical accuracy a clean handwritten or typed copy should be prepared for submission to the treasury department to this copy should be attached copy b of form w together with all schedules necessary to support deductions claimed on the return tax laws are complicated and often beyond the comprehension of the layman knowing this phony tax experts open up shops in candy stores barber shops poolrooms gas stations vacant stores etc during tax time each year some yearend tax preparers are fully capable while many others are either ignorant of the tax laws or are downright crooked several years ago a new york city newspaper tested the accuracy of these flybynight establishments and sent reporters with a set of hypothetical figures to five different taxseason experts the result was five different sets of answers yet despite warnings each year from governmental authorities and professional groups countless persons fall prey to these phony tax consultants usually the lure is that theyll get you a refund maybe so but you the taxpayer must pay the piper if your figures for deductions which you can actually substantiate are doctored and stretched in order to get you the refund the internal revenue service recently issued information concerning the arrest and conviction of rings which consisted of these illicit operators and internal revenue service personnel one a pennsylvanian asked his clients to sign blank returns and to make their tax payment check to his order he then falsely increased deductions and paid a reduced tax and pocketed the difference in addition to a yearandaday prison sentence he was placed on probation for three years during which time he cannot prepare any returns other than his own a parttime salesman convinced many persons that the w form was the full tax return he then prepared false returns containing exaggerated deductions and listed nonexistent dependents signed the return himself and after receiving the refund checks forged the endorsements and pocketed the refunds still another induced his customers to sign forms authorizing the government to mail the refund checks to his order unaware of the actual amount of their refunds as they never saw the copy filed with the revenue service the taxpayers accepted the amounts tendered while the tax consultant pocketed the difference under existing laws and regulations a taxpayer is responsible for the accuracy of his tax return and can face both civil and criminal penalties for the filing of a false return how can you protect yourself against this racket in any part of the country you can find a qualified lawyer or accountant who regularly does tax work what you have to keep in mind is that anyone who wants to can under existing law designate himself as a tax expert it is a safe guess that there is at least one crooked expertand probably morein every community and he can get as many as a thousand innocent taxpayers into serious trouble with the government so watch out the internal revenue service has recently issued a list of suggestions to taxpayers who are seeking assistance in the preparation of their returns be sure of the competence and integrity of a prospective tax advisor consult the better business bureau or similar organization if no other references are available be sure the tax advisor has a permanent place of business where he can be reached in case the internal revenue service subsequently questions data on the return except where absolutely necessary do not sign a powerofattorney form always insist that refund checks come to you not the consultant never sign a blank return you are fully responsible for everything appearing on your return beware of those whose stock in trade is their claim of ability to obtain large refunds be especially careful of those who ask for a fee based on the amount to be refunded steer clear of any advisor who suggests claiming dependencies or other deductions to which you are not entitled participation in such a scheme may result in serious criminal and civil penalties cooperate with the government by reporting any suspicious actions by practitioners or any evidence of unethical or fraudulent practices your information will be held in confidence to these we might add the following a insist that your advisor be a licensed lawyer licensed accountant or person who is enrolled to practice before the treasury department lawyers and cpas are automatically enrolled others have to pass a rigid test to see if they know the tax law b examine your return before signing it make sure no incorrect items are listed accidentally or otherwise c when you owe money insist on making your check payable to the district director of internal revenue or to the internal revenue service mail your return yourself d be very cautious with advisors who claim that they can save you money in comparison with what you have paid in the past perhaps the best advice you can get in connection with your yearend tax problem is to stop looking for bargains a competent tax advisor will usually charge a fee based on the complexity of the return or the amount of detail involved but the fee if larger than that charged by the flybynight operator will be in line with that charged by other ethical professional tax men every return filed is checked for mathematical accuracy by a comptometer operator thereafter trained auditors scan each return for items of obvious error and for items of unusual nature you may receive tentative approval or you may receive a letter directing you to appear at the local office of the district director with proof of certain items claimed on your return your first thought when receiving a communication is why me the treasury department takes a second look at returns which contain large or unusual deductions where claim is made for large refunds where items are not fully explained where abnormally large deductions are claimed in relation to income all returns which have gross income of a certain figure are checked all business returns of a certain gross sales volume are checked the limits set each year by high officials in the treasury department these figures are not released to the public and are circulated to internal revenue service personnel only the treasury department has many sources of information available to it to ascertain that you are reporting all sources of taxable income your employer is required to file form w showing any wages paid to you any person firm or organization paying you or more in compensation fees commissions rents etc is required to forward such information on form any payor of dividends or interest of or more is also required to report such payments on form banks are required to report any unusual currency transactions in your account treasury agents keep a close check on county clerk offices to observe purchases of real estate they keep a close watch at race tracks and other places where large amounts of cash are spent they read divorce proceedings and separation suits where financial data is exposed they read newspaper accounts of robberies involving cash and jewelry a constant check is kept on prizes and awards given on television programs and in nationwide contests or sweepstakes no doubt youve read about adp automatic data processing is being used by the government to establish a history of each taxpayer on magnetic tape reports of dividend interest and other payments will be fed into the input and made part of the individual history comparison will be made with the return as filed and electronically the machine will punch out cards to alert the treasury department to failures to report taxable income another source of information is the informer our government checks letters sent to it by persons bearing a grudge who reveal information about taxpayers a jilted girl friend a jealous neighbor a disgruntled exemployee a dissatisfied present employee are but a few sources of squeal information to encourage this practice the government pays awards to informers based on the amount of the tax and penalty recovered and the amount of help received in the information furnished many congressmen are disenchanted with any system which encourages one person to spy on another and attempts have been made and at this writing are being made to suspend the system of making payments to informers what do you do when you are called for examination if you had your return prepared by a taxattorney or by an accountant it is best to let him handle the audit professional tax practitioners are better equipped to handle this matter and are less apt to put their foot into their mouths as you might do when representing yourself should you have someone representing you it is the best policy to cooperate fully by revealing complete facts regarding the items shown on your return locate all supporting evidence cancelled checks receipts etc and give these to the person whom you picked to represent you a word of caution where you were foolish enough to have your return prepared by one of the phony operators discussed previously it is best to represent yourself or secure a competent person to assume the responsibility of conducting the audit representing yourself call at the office at the time designated or if you cant keep the appointment call in advance and ask for a change to a more suitable date how are you to act the first rule is not to be offensive remember that the examining officer or revenue agent is only doing his or her job let the agent do the talking and let him tell you exactly what items are being questioned where you are asked to produce proof of a deduction taken on the return show the receipted bill or cancelled checks and if the agent is not satisfied offer to get additional information keep in mind that the audit does not have to be completed in that one visit you can ask for and youll readily get an opportunity to produce substantiating evidence to support your claim deductions where you can prove most of your deduction but not to the last penny the agent will most likely give you the benefit of the doubt if you have been agreeable cooperative and in a position to prove most of your deductions by evidencenot by oral argument when the agent reveals that he has information of income which is not disclosed on your return and you omitted such income based on your honest belief that such item is not taxable income show what evidence you can that such omission is based on law not just a desire to avoid paying taxes the agent will probably have on his desk a copy of one of the private tax services such as prentice hall or commerce clearing house and hell be glad to check in these volumes if you give a quote or section number to support your argument each proposed disallowance of deduction that you claimed and each proposed addition to taxable income will be discussed with you before the agent writes his report where you agree to the changes he will write his report and ask you to sign a form wherein you agree to the charges and waive your right to take the matter to the tax court where you subsequently find that you were wrong in signing such form you can sue in the federal district court or in the court of claims to recover the taxes you paid butsuppose you dont agree with the changes that the agent proposes then you dont have to sign anything you thank him for his courtesy and ask him to send you a notice of the proposed changes from this point on you are dueling with the government but you have many many powerful forces on your side before the treasury department can issue an assessment and force you to pay additional taxes when you indicate that you do not agree to the proposed changes the agent will send you a letter stating the proposed changes and will arrange a conference with his group chief at this conference you will be given an opportunity to discuss the findings and to dispute them and show why you think your return as filed was correct should you not reach an agreement at this conference you will receive a copy of the agents report together with what is known as the day letter this letter gives you three courses of action you can execute form which will be enclosed agreeing to the agents determinations and thus closing the case or you can file a formal protest setting forth the pertinent facts why you think you are right this is filed with the district director of internal revenue the appeal is referred to the appellate division you can ignore the day letter and wait for the government to send you what is known as a day letter which is a statutory notice when you file a formal protest after the receipt of the day letter another conference is arranged this time with conferees in the appellate division an informal atmosphere prevails at these conferences no stenographer is present and you or your designated agent are given the opportunity to offer either written or oral evidence to refute the agents contentions every attempt will be made to reach an agreement and not have the case reach an impasse where you cannot reach agreement and a closing form is not executed you will receive the day letter which is statutory notice of the governments intention to issue an assessment against you the day letter will inform you that unless you decide to agree to the assessment as proposed you must make a petition to the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency if you dont petition the tax court you will lose by forfeit and the government can levy its assessment but if you do ask the tax court to docket your case for a hearing the government cannot collect or levy an assessment except in very unusual cases where there is reason to believe that collection would be endangered by delay all during the period of waiting for your case to be heard by the tax court the opportunity is given you to settle your case conferences are granted to iron out differences of opinion and to effect compromises at the hearing before the tax court every avenue of justice is available to the taxpayer the court may decide for either the taxpayer or for the government or may decide that the issue is one that just requires a recomputation of tax liability after defining some points in either sides favor where a taxpayer loses a case in the tax court he may post a bond to cover the amount of the tax and take the case to the court of appeals and even to the u s supreme court this is one very unfortunate situation with relation to tax court decisions you might have a case which is exactly like another one to the last dotted i yet the same issue will be brought up by the government in an audit of your return this is because the commissioner of internal revenue can acquiesce or not acquiesce to any given decision if the commissioner does not acquiesce in an adverse decision each taxpayer must argue the same issue many congressmen are alarmed over this situation and have proposed that the commissioner in the event of a nonacquiescence must take the case on appeal to a higher court so that the issue is resolved one way or the other the same situation prevails in the event that you elected to bypass the tax court in this event you would have had to pay the tax deficiency and sue for a refund if the district director did not honor your claim for a refund presented on form again you have an opportunity for conferences before the case is tried in the court of claims or in the district court appeals from both can be made to the u s supreme court the trouble with district court cases is that the same issue can be settled with different results in different districts the district courts are free to ignore decisions of other districts here again congressmen are trying to convince the commissioner that where different decisions are given to a similar set of facts in different districts that the case be taken on appeal automatically to the u s supreme court for final adjudication the entire system of our tax laws is designed so that the administration of these laws is consistent with the principles of american fair play and justice as emphasized mistakes are made laws may seem unreasonable and tax time may be unwelcome but it is a reminder that the costs of freedom come high i never will forget that day in early september about dusk when dick came home from work on aubrey bradleys farm raving about tea ice we hired outdick and me to the farmers around in our vicinity of the hocking valley whenever we could get a days work the week before we had worked every day for jim chevaliar the harelip township trustee putting up loose hay aubrey bradley baled his hay it sure was heavier that way when he used the little baler those bundles came out weighing about sixty or seventy pounds when he used the new baling machine they weighed ninety or a hundred that was almost moren i weighed i was getting ready to graduate from high school next term and ever since id been there i had tried everything i could think of to get the scales up past a hundredun twenty i guess thats why aubrey bradley asked for dick to come to work that early monday morning in september when he drove out to our house and stopped so fast the dust and gravel caught up with his red pickup truck when he skidded to a fishtail halt in the winter a farmer could take his time but in the summer he had to hustle to make hay while the sun shined not only is farming fast work but its back breaking which as i said is why aubrey bradley hired dick that morning and not me dick was sixteen a year youngern me but he was twice as sturdy and he was as strong as a young white oak tree i was more like a softwood maple i would hold together but a topheavy load could send me sagging before that summer before jim chevaliar hired dick and me to set fence posts and then to put up hay when the haying season cameneither of us had learned much about farming our family owned one of the largest pieces of land in that part of the valley one hundred acres but it was all grown over with underbrush grandpa had never really intended to farm it when he bought it oh he said he wanted the boys my unclesto farm it and he even bought a couple of horses and a cow but hehimselfwas not a farmer he was a city factory worker who moved to the country to have room for his family his sonsmy unclesfollowed in his footsteps they tried to farm at first but somehow everyone else was always harvesting by the time the boys finished plowing the rolling west thirty acres beside the house by the time dick and i became farming ageother boys we went to school with started when they were about eight or tenour family had given up all pretenses of ever becoming farmers my uncles had even tom away half of the front of the barn so they could get their cars inside to work on them away from the snow by the time i reached high school grandpa had died my uncles had gone off to columbus or akron looking for work and ma had sort of inherited the running of the farm starting at seventeen working for harelipped township trustee jim chevaliar i found farming a very difficult task half the time i had to guess what jim chevaliar wanted his words always came out in a wheezy raspy whisper covered all over with a shower of spit i never made fun though like the kids at school used to do i had been taught better than that i just tried to guess what he wanted and then do it maybe thats why he hired dick and me in the first place certainly there were lots of other boys around who knew more about farming i was glad to be making a little money but i wasnt always sure farming was the best way especially when the hay got stacked so high on the wagon that i couldnt throw a pitchfork full all the way to the top and it came tumbling back down on me to stick to my sweat or even worse when it came time to put it away in the hayloft hades itself surely can be no drier or hotter than the position furthest back in a hayloft in late afternoon right under the sunbaked tin roof where nary a breeze ever stirred and the chaff dinged to your sweaty skin like short prickly leeches i never thought i would live to crawl out of that hole into the air again but when i did and jim chevaliar took us home long after suppertime there was a certain innerglowing satisfaction at knowing that i had earned five more dollars i knew my five dollars never amounted up very fast but i pulled the little wad out of my watch pocket every night and shook out the chaff when i fell exhausted across my bed overlooking the ribbonlike dirt road i wondered how many mornings jim chevaliar would drive up that road or how many more mornings id be able to drag my aching bones out of bed to meet him finally come saturday the last of jim chevaliars hay was stored in the hotbox of a bam loft and dick and me began to wonder how we would spend our money we knew it would be for school clothes probably a pair of levis i needed a pair of shoes the only ones i had now had one sole flapping theyd already been half soled and they would have made it through the winter if i hadnt had to wear them in the hay field or maybe id buy some new shirts or socks it didnt matter i only wished there was more money so i could buy all my school things myself dick and me were just lying there in the yard under the maple tree nursing our aching muscles and looking at the montgomery ward catalogue trying to decide between all the things to buy and wishing we had more money when here come aubrey bradleys red pickup truck kicking gravel and dust for half a mile jim chevaliar never drove his old blue chevrolet pickup like that but then jim chevaliar was an old man never in a hurry for anything even when the hay was already cut and the sky darkened with rain clouds he just plodded on and somehow we always managed to be sitting in the swing on his front porch drinking ice water by the time the rains came but with aubrey bradleyhe was a young farmer maybe just in his early fortieseverything had to be done right now why dick hardly had time to tell anyone where he was goingnot that there was anyone much else than me to tell since ma was at work in town and we didnt fancy reporting to the girlsbefore he was sitting up on the back of that pickup holding on for dear life and looking for the world like he was afraid the dust and gravel was going to catch up with him at any moment i just kept on looking at the montgomery ward catalogue and wondering what dick would buy with his extra money i wondered how much more money he would have than i had since wed never worked for aubrey bradley before i didnt know if he paid bettern the fifty cents an hour that jim chevaliar paid or even if he paid that good he certainly looked more prosperous with his fine big white house sitting in the middle of those sloping hills right on the highway wed always wondered how much land he owned beyond the hill and out of sight i guess there had always been a lot of things we wondered about aubrey bradleys farm with its great herd of hereford id always fancied myself a beef cattle man too ever since i studied agriculture in the ninth grade course a hereford steer was out of the question as a class project so i planted a quarter acre of potatoes we would have done that anyway to get us through the winter as soon as i could i quit the ag class but i still admired aubrey bradleys herd of whitefaced herefords aubrey bradleys oldest daughter norma jean was in dicks class and she never acted like her family was anything special but howie willet who had worked on the farm since he was in the third grade and learned to drive tractors and trucks there was in dicks room too and howie always acted like he was something real special aubrey bradleys man not just a hired hand by the summer when aubrey hired dick howie was practically like a foreman so there were all kind of things i wanted to know about aubrey bradleys farm when dick got home that night was it harder working in baled hay than loose hay was howie willet really as important as he pretended and was the bradley house really as nice as it looked from the highway hidden behind that white picket fence imagine how put out i was when dick came home talking about ice tea he was raving about ice tea mrs bradley served it with the midday meal and it tastes like nothing you ever drunk before dick marveled he did arouse my curiosity some it wasnt like id never heard of ice tea before i had the rich folks ma worked for in town served it all the time i saw them drinking it once when they hired me on saturday to mow the lawn but i had to confess id never drunk any the only time we had any ice in our house was when ma bought a fiftypound block or two twentyfive pound blocksor what was left of it after a twenty mile ride from townhome in the trunk of the car for the ice box if there had ever been any extra ice it would have been too dirty after it was wrapped in a burlap bag and set in a tub in the trunk of the car to be used for ice tea so i was seventeen years old and had never drunk ice tea you would have thought that was a cardinal sin the way dick carried on that night he came home from working for aubrey bradley he talked about ice tea so much at supper that he got on everybodys nerveseven mas it was only when the girls started making fun of a sixteenyearold boy carrying on so that he was shamed into silence one thing dick didnt like was being made fun of but as soon as we went to bed he started again trying to tell me just how it tasted i told him i probably wouldnt like it he knew didnt eat anything new i reminded him how i got sick just trying to eat beets after that time he smacked his lips over them for so long i think dick got a special kick out of telling me about something i didnt like he just kept on talking about beets boiled buttered cooked any kind of way after he found out i couldnt eat them almost anything but beans and taters tasted strange to me oh but youd love ice tea he exclaimed its so cold but not like water its kinda sweet and moren that its got a peculiar twangyflavor he went to sleep looking forward more to the next days glass of ice tea than the sixtyfive cents an hour aubrey bradley paid f xaubrey needed extra help the next day because he was right in the thick of the third baling he hired me when he came after dick working for aubrey bradley was a heap bettern working for jim chevaliar in one respect with baled hay there werent any scapegoats had to stand all the way back in the hayloft under a burning tin roof pitching for dear life at the hay cutting you off from your one air hole least ways at first i thought it was better working in baled hay it wasnt too bad at first when the bales were as thick as the morning dew and you hardly had to move out of your tracks to throw em on the wagon moving between the rows i felt kinda good to be working with dick again him on one side of the wagon and me on the other pitchin bales for hallelujah like a team although we never said it in words didnt have to those ole bales said it for us just as fast as his hitwhump mine landed with another whump all while the morning sun rose we marched through the field behind that tractor and wagon whump whump whump the bales hitting end to end on the first tier side by side on the second and then end to end again whump whump about the time the sun soaked up the last of the dew off the clover all those easy bales were gone then we had to stray further and further from the tractors path to pick up bales needless to say the quicker we got back with em the less distance we had to run with em to catch the tractor one thing about howie willet when he was driving tractor he didnt wait he went right down the row at his set speed and either you were there with the bale or you ran and caught him always made like he couldnt see you when the bales were piled so high but i suspected he hated to see aubrey so far ahead on the baler by the time the sun dried out the alfalfa stubble which made it jab like spears up through the flapping sole of my shoe the bales were stacked five tiers high higher than i could reach my whumps had lost their umph and the bales i flung landed with soft plops about half way up the pile and there i went racing after the tractor pushing the bale the rest of the way up then i had to run back and git what i missed by the time we pulled into the barnyard to unload the first load that loose hay of jim chevaliars never looked so good both dick and me were nursing hands with palms red and rutted from the wire binding that the new baler used course the string that the old baler bound the hay with could cut your skin a lot quicker if you made the mistake of letting it slide along your fingers so i held on to the bales for dear life and when the right time came flung for all i was worth when that wagonful was unloaded i fell back on the stack in the barn more wilted than a tomato plant in a drought without a support stake and i dont believe jim chevaliars hayloft ever made me any hotter my tongue was hanging worsen a hound dogs after a useless rabbit chase i couldnt even respond when norma jean came to the back porch and hollered out whether or not we wanted her to fix us something cold to drink luckily for me howie went after it though i dont know why he was hot from just riding on the tractor he was gone a good while and i was glad i just lay there on the bales of hay panting and peering at my red blistering palms thats when dick started again man i sure hope he comes back with some of that good ice tea he crooned i was so hot that even the salty sweat trinkling through the corners of my mouth tasted good a good tall glass of water with ice cubes tinkling against the sides would have hit the spot perfectly but if he came back with ice tea i would jump for iteven if i did have a thing about not liking anything new anything wet would have been good but dick kept harping about ice tea almost bragging the way he did about buttered beets i was just hot i didnt care about his ice tea all i wanted was something cold man you know aint nobody serves ice tea in the barn i snapped maybe it was my implication that he didnt know etiquette more than my rebuke that riled him but i could tell he was riled by the way he tensed his body and snapped his shoulders back proudly after that he didnt say anything he just sat there and stared at me with beady eyes set in a sweaty forehead for his sake i kinda hoped howie would come back with ice tea for my sake though i was glad to see a pitcher of ice water nothing tastes as good as cold water when youre roasting inside but before i could cool off my innards that darn fool howie jumped on the tractor again and yelled something about aubrey getting way ahead of us now if theres anything makes you feel worsen you do bringing in a load its knowing that you got to start all over again and the hardest partthrowing hundredpound bales a mile highis just behind you and so fresh in your mind you cant even enjoy starting out at the bottom again the second load the one aubrey baled while we picked up yesterdays work was on a hillside dick looked at me with his stillbeady eyes and jumped off the wagon on the uphill side i didnt mind taking the downhill side where all the throwing was uphill because i was older just because dick was as straight and as strong as a young white oak tree and i was more like softwood maple was no reason to let himor howie who was in dicks class a grade behind me think i would slough off the hardest part besides id lived around dick long enough to know to stay out of his way when his eyes were beady our team work was broken up right away dick snatched bales of hay right and left and slammed them onto the wagonwhump whumpfwhump it was impossible for me to keep up with that pace throwing the bales uphill and all and with the spearing chaff penetrating my flapping shoe sole like i was barefooted and howie as soon as the bales were three or four tiers high couldnt see me anymore so he gauged his speed by dicks work on the uphill side and he kept chugging along faster and faster sweat and loose chaff ran in rivulets together under my tee shirt by dinner time i wondered just how in the world much work aubrey bradley expected for each sixtyfive cents the fact that it was the best wages i had ever earned was little consolation to my nowwelted hands and my right foot pricked through the flapping sole by so much chaff i was limping i would have quit with half a days pay but it was a good three miles home and i didnt think i could walk that far i sat atop the jogging towering stack of bales as we went in with the noon load and mulled over what i should do certainly i wouldnt do anything until after i ate dinner maybe by the time the dinner hour was over i would have found an easier way to load hay just another glass of ice water might shed an entirely different light on the matter the hot sun and the baling wire had taken some of the beady glisten out of dicks eyes too now youre gonna find out just how good ice tea tastes he half whispered high above the tractor drivers head i dunno id just as soon have a good glass of water i suggested you dont know wha chere talking about dick almost shouted then he boasted course you aint never tasted no ice tea before neither dick nor i was ever really sure whether or not he could hurt me if we really got mad as far back as when we were at lotteridge grade school dick was the only person i wouldnt put the boxing gloves on with at recess time and that included big ole bobby sampson in the class ahead of me and bullshouldered jay price i knew either of them could tear me apart anytime they wanted but sampson and jay were my best friends i knew they wouldnt hit me hard unless i hit hard first the one time i did forget myself and laid a straight left jab on sampson that swelled his eye i hurried and took off the gloves while the teacher and everyone looked at his bruise but i never would put the gloves on with dick even though somebody was always after us to go at it i guess i just never liked the idea of the only colored boys in school fighting each other we never discussed it but i was sure dick felt the same way everybody said i was scared of him everybody in school knew dick was stronger but both dick and i remembered the time i caught him around the neck and jerked him off that little russell boy who called dick a nigger i got scared he was going to kill the russell boy and i nearly choked dick to death ever since then dick never started a fight with me whenever he got mad he just kept goading trying to get me mad enough to forget myself and hit him or hed just sit real still and his eyes git real beady if he didnt feel like fighting thats the way he sat atop those bales of hay riding in for dinner where they would serve ice tea i couldnt be sure he was sulking because he looked away from me like he was surveying all aubrey bradleys meadows but he sat like that all the rest of the way across that bumpy field and i just figured it was because i had insulted him by suggesting i might not like ice tea anyway if he had been sulking on the wagon it left him as soon as we washed up and he saw those glasses of winecolored ice tea setting around the dinner table w i paid more attention to the fancy white table cloth and the curved glassfront china cabinet in the dining room and the fact that we were eating in the dining room and all of usdick and myself howie aubrey bradley mrs bradley and their two daughters it never dawned on me right then that in all that big fine white house hidden away from the highway behind the white picket fence that this was the only place for anybody to eat i just kept hoping i wouldnt get the white table cloth dirty or break the dishes dick just kept jabbing me in the ribs while aubrey bradley said the blessing and nodding toward the ice tea and grinning from ear to ear i just studied the silverware the way the knife and spoon rested on a napkin and the fork all by itself on the left side of the plate suddenly the bottom fell out of my stomach taking my appetite with it i didnt know anything about the kind of table manners that called for the knife and spoon on one side of the plate and the fork on the other god what was i supposed to do i declined the peas when howie passed them i didnt like peas and i wasnt hungry any longer anyway by the time the potatoes got to me i figured i could watch carefully and do what everyone else did i was just settling down inside when howie passed the pork chops and kept the fork off the platter for a moment i faltered and nearly dropped the platter whats the matter boy we been working you so hard youre weak aubrey laughed i grinned my left hand edged toward my fork on the table but somehow that just didnt seem right getting the meat off the platter with the same fork i was going to eat with course we did it that way at home but we didnt have the knife and spoon on one side of the plate and the fork on the other quickly i passed the platter on to dick an act which i immediately regretted when mrs bradley remarked on the sparseness of my meal i passed it off with the explanation that im a beans and tater man cant get much work out of you this afternoon on what youre eating aubrey barked looking at the little bit of potatoes on my plate i was beginning to hope that ice tea was everything dick said it was the first few minutes at the table had restored my reason enough for me to know that i couldnt go home at noon i wanted the extra two dollars and sixty cents for a handcarved leather belt with a silver buckle i saw in the montgomery ward catalogue so i swallowed hard and figured id make it through the afternoon as best i could on the potatoes and a couple glasses of ice tea i watched dick gulp down half a glass of the brown liquid almost swallowing the ring of lemon and a big square ice cube in his haste then he dived into the pork chops potatoes and peas on his plate i looked at the ice tea again it must be good i told myself if he can drink it like that besides it was the last thing between me and all those hundred pound bales id throw before nightfall my stinging puffed hands almost fumbled the cool glass of nourishment just feeling all those wires wrapped around em the very coolness of the outside of the glass was refreshing and it strengthened me i lifted the muddybrown tea to my lips and closed my eyes the first cold drops parched my tongue like it was water and quickly i tipped the glass and poured down half the coldness halfway to somewhere my taste buds translated the coldness into bitter indescribable strangling fluid it came back up into the glass and onto the white table cloth chased by gasps and chokes i begged mrs bradleys pardon saying the tea had gone down my wind pipe and i reached for some water it was only then that i realized ice tea was the only drink on the table i smothered a few more coughs and sputters with potatoes when mrs bradley came around again with the tea pitcher i politely said no thank you maam x seemed io wynton that his brother was in a particularly black mood for one thing it was hotwell over s v j a ninety againand after two weeks the muggy days had not ended for another the weekenders were even more worrisome than usual for the last two hours groups of them had been hanging around the cottage staring and asking questions it was especially hard on arnie because he never liked them in the first place if he answered at all it was usually something that made them stop suddenly look him up and down and stalk away well white people were like that it didnt pay to fool around with them mr raglin would probably say something about it when the day was over why dont you just take off wyn arnie said finally turning to wynton with nervous impatience go on take a swim i can handle these goons arnies face tensed as he spoke of the tourists for a while anyway he added darkly then turned and again leaned over the big freezer his white tshirt was wet at the armpits and beads of sweat dropped from the tip of his nose into the salted ice i aint tired wynton said perkily trying to show in his voice he really meant it anyway its only a couple more hours when the next boat gets back we can both wynton cut himself off for arnie had stopped churning the machine and was staring testily at the floor wynton knew he wanted to be alone maybe he said tentatively after a pause i could just run on over to the broadside and see about that ice we hardly got enough to to hell with the ice arnie said raising his voice i mean just forget about the ice you wasnt born to drag ice around here in the hot sun now stop botherin me hear just go on down to the beach and ill be along in a couple of hours arnie had tried to soften his voice for he did not often swear at wynton but it was too late and the younger boy glanced dejectedly at the back of his brothers head then left the cottage without a word outside was like an inferno it was the hottest part of the day the sun beat down on the patches of grass and the blazing white cottages with an intensity you could almost see could almost hear the maryland countryside rose and lowered in the distance and beyond the lake where the hills met the sky the faraway trees seemed to simmer in the heat wynton swallowed hard and tried to shake off his brothers words arnie was all right when he wasnt mad but lately he had been getting madder and madder a little madder every weekend wynton did not always understand him maybe it would be better that night when the work was done wynton breathed heavily through his mouth and continued along the narrow dirt path that led from the cottage area to the lake off in the distance the long white beach glared like a luminous band and he could hardly wait to plunge headlong into the water and let the lazy warm waves swallow up his body it seemed to be deserted most of the guests had taken the cruise to storey point or were lounging around the cottages where the shade trees were wynton could make out an abandoned rowboat and nearby a colony of those funny strutting little birds with the spearshaped bills that had been hanging around all week they looked so funny wynton had given them a name fussy grannies because they were so much like old people he named all the animals he saw the cottontails were dancers foxes were sneaky boys and squirrels were jello because they were so fidgety and shook all the time even at half a mile wynton could hear the grannies talking among themselves and fussing it was like each of them were constantly answering the other full of conviction like old people thats right thats right right wynton loved it along the lake in the summertime he loved the water and the beach and the dark woods where he and arnie rode horseback in the heat of the day he loved sitting at night at the edge of the lake tossing firecrackers into the blackness hearing them pop just before they struck the water sometimes arnie took him along to the broadside where they sat in the corner away from the crowd while arnie drank beer that was mostly on thursdays just before the weekend after that things changed pretty much mr raglin had to smile all the time around the tourists and that made him all the meaner around arnie mr raglin ran the ice cream house where the weekenders sat and talked when the sun was hot along with rev sharkey he was trying to make a man of arnie who had dropped out of college and was talking about joining the merchant marines dont throw it up just yet rev sharkey would say glancing at arnie in his nervous way the world hasnt failed yougive it a chance what kind of example will you be to your brother and such a young man but arnie was a loner and didnt much trust thingsor people not even rev sharkey not a lot anyway wynton reached the edge of the beach and felt the hot sand burn his feet not a whiff of wind was stirring and out across the lake the water was dead still like glass he was just about to climb out of his shirt when suddenly he froze somewhere on the beach a woman was laughing the sound like from another world caused wyntons heart to leap and he glanced quickly around the desolate beach at last he saw themwhat looked like half a dozen people clustered around an umbrella down at the far end somebody a woman had stood up now and was walking back and forth along the edge of the water from the distance she seemed to be dancing now wynton could hear the unison sound of hands being clapped and all at once a peel of laughter highpitched drunken the tourists were a strange lot they did such peculiar things from the city they came carloadsfull to lie upon the beach they lived in big white cottages along the highway and held loud parties far into the night daytimes you could find them at the ice cream house grinning nervously and asking all sorts of silly questions wynton did not always understand the world sometimes he agreed with arnie that it was all just a dream full of meaningless people doing meaningless things they seem real enough arnie always said but when you investigate try to touch them theres no one there its kind of scary wynton wynton was about to turn away when the dancing woman lifted her hand and seemed to call him she stood widelegged at the edge of the water waving back and forth and now and then he caught snatches of her voice wynton was a little afraid of the tourists they were all right he figured but you couldnt always tell reluctantly he buttoned his shirt and hurried down toward the umbrella wishing he had thought to wear his shoes when he arrived the tourists six of them three men and three womenwere sprawled across the sand one of them was mr cain who lived in washington but owned a guest house up the road the woman who had called him lay on her back a strange grin on her face youre the kid from the ice cream house arent you yes mam we were wondering if you could get us one of those boats well pay she didnt look exactly at him more at the top of his head her eyes laughing leave the boy alone ethel one of the men grunted lazily if the boats were for rent thered be somebody over there he was old and wrinkled like mr cain and the other man all the women were young shut up hal she replied and giggled im making time with the kid whats your name sonny wynton mam answered wynton feeling a tremor pass through his body why had he come he thought suddenly why hadnt he looked away pretended not to see them the smell of whiskey was everywhere these were the people who had come in last night well wynton youre just the cutest little thing but i saw you spying on me a minute ago anyway hows the fishing around here its all right i guess wynton stammered if you want a ill go and ask thats all right son said the wrinkled man brushing a fly from his forehead nobody here wants a boat the dancing woman sniggled againthis time kind of different and glanced out across the beach hal brought his own amusement she said at last thats how it is with these elderly bastards dont swear around the kid ethel the wrinkled man said but he didnt seem to much care the fly had returned and was giving him trouble what i mean the woman went on again studying the top of wyntons head is that this here is mr shulan hes a united states congressman very important youve been reading about him im sure you study the government in school no mam wynton said uncomfortably glancing nervously at his feet he had tried to give the answer a kind of finality maybe now they would let him go of course he doesnt study any government interrupted another woman who looked exactly like the first that is they both wore skimpy bathing suits and plucked their eyebrows like in the movies they both looked like marilyn monroe thats in the high schools for cryin out loud well he oughta be studying it said ethel teach him about the democratic process about the wonderful job hal js doing there was a loud sniggle just then but wynton did not look up when finally he managed to raise his eyes it was only to gaze nervously out across the lake from the direction of the boathouse a faint breeze made ripples in the water and far away the trees on jacksons island swayed gently back and forth wynton remembered the time he had swum all the way across and then back again and hadnt told anybody arnie would have thrashed him then he shifted his weight awkwardly from one foot to the other as if to break the spell the quiet day suddenly exploded with sound the earsplitting foghorn honked twice and then was silent captain adams old excursion boat was making its sluggish way toward the boathouse a trail of churning water followed its slow course along the lake and tourists stood on both decks staring silently at the shore the explorers are back ethel said tiredly slapping loudly at her thigh have your last cocktail children god what a weekend mr shulan took a long swallow from a flask he had been holding on his lap and placed it carefully underneath one of the blankets we should have gone to the peninsula like i said no offense cain its been great ethel giggled again theres a platform at the peninsula and hal could do his stuff everybody laughed andrew jackson shulan the third man said the new savior from the west its a commodity said mr cain he does it very well the congressman remained silent seeming bored he crossed his hairy legs on the blanket and stared listlessly at the lake wynton saw his chance and took it excuse me miss he stammered pointing to the boat and without waiting for a reply took off across the sand toward the boathouse he ran quickly not daring to look back funny people he thought at last reaching the edge of the water and letting his feet wade in the shallow warm surf kind of scary though wynton had never met a congressman they ran the country miss stevenson saidcongressmen and senators and the president they were the spirit of america and every kid should want to be one but arnie wasnt like that and wynton loved his brother and wanted to be like him life was so awfully strange sometimes you didnt always know what was what for at the same time wynton did want to be a congressman or maybe the president and amie they all said would never amount to anything at the boathouse the passengers were already filing down the wobbly ramp observing them wynton lost all thoughts of the congressman and of arnie they were so funny the tourists for all his shyness wynton loved to observe them watch them do their funny things like lying halfnaked in the blazing sun or stomping around in the woods in their short pants or funniest of all shaking their bodies on the dance floor over at the broadside arnie called them a plague but wynton enjoyed them from a distance there was something a little strange about the tourists like most white people they smiled a lot but you couldnt always tell after the boat was empty captain adams said there was no sweeping to do so wynton followed the last of the passengers from the boathouse and down the narrow beach the crowd fanned out along the sand looking like hundreds and hundreds of strange and funny birds already some had entered the lake and the day rang with splashing water the squeals of excited women more umbrellas in strange lively colors burst open along the beach and gay expensivelooking blankets dotted the sand wynton ran wildly along the beach feeling fresh and happy in spite of the heat when the weekenders came it was like a carnival full of colors and the music of a hundred transistors all playing at once noise followed them everywhere on the beach at the ice cream house in the big white cottages where they held their latenight parties americans ruled the world miss stevenson once said because they had more energy like honey bees to wynton they were more like flies nervous and jittery with nothing to do america was the greatest nation in the world she liked to say but arnie who had worked last summer in haiti didnt agree we dont know what a nation is he had shouted to wynton one night as they sat at the edge of the lake a nation wyn is a kind of tribea large family you might saywith millions and millions of brothers and sisters nephews cousins they eat the same food speak the same language they even look something alike they are one people and to defend that principle every man woman and child stands ready to die thats what a nation is wynan identity a pride americans dont understand that well whatever it was wynton wanted to be a leader a congressman perhaps and be a credit to his country thinking it over he found a deserted spot near the trees and lay his head down in the sand musedly watching a small rowboat filled with shouting people a little ways out from the shore wynton must have fallen asleep for all of a sudden he lay wide awake upon the sand knowing something horrible had happened on the beach about a dozen yards away at the edge of the lake a large group of people had gathered round mr shulan and someone was handing him a pistol get those kids back someone shouted and suddenly a woman screamed his heart pounding wynton leaped madly from the ground and hurried down to the shore fearing what he might see but no more able to turn back than had he been drawn by a magnet the tourists had formed a tight little knot near the lake and had fallen strangely silent staring excitedly into the water something very wrong had happened to the day and overhead the scattered clouds hung motionless in the sky a scrawny old woman in a pink bathing suit the blue veins showing in her legs made an ugly face showing her teeth and a groaning sound deep in her chest a man nearby grabbed his little boy and held him high in the air to see after a long while wynton at last saw it about thirty feet out what looked like half its body protruded from the water and only a brief flicker of its tongue let you know it was a live thing and not some tree limb some large twig washed in from the deep mocassin one of the men said straight from hell get those people back wynton stared at the treelimb object silent and still in the trem bling water and felt a strange fear all his life he had seen them a hundred times slithering from the water in the still of the day going silently easily to their secret places the lake area was full of them so the old people said wynton called them old grey because thats how they werecool and damp and mysterious often he would discover one in the road its long body flattened by a car and pick it up and fling it into the weeds sometimes he kept it stripping its skin and tying it to the light string in his room at mr raglins some of the kids made belts he had never before feared old grey but this one seemed different with the crowd all around wynton looked at the congressman who was doing something to the pistol and then out at the mute motionless object in the water and breathed silently it could have crossed the lake he figured and gone in at the island or farther down the beach but that was old grey he didnt have much of a brain except for getting food he didnt know about tourists and children and safety precautions and things he lived in his own little world a slow secret place where people didnt go now he was trapped unable to stay in the water and blocked from getting on the beach but he didnt seem to panic in spite of all the people snakes were mostly like that wynton was staring regretfully at the water when suddenly it happened he would remember it for years to come one of those brief experiences unknown to adults that so powerfully affect a young child reality for a brief moment seems to run amok all the familiar things are there but somehow disjointed and horrible like a nightmare the congressman had raised the pistol above his head and was waving it gaily back and forth the gesture sure practiced reminded wynton of the ringmaster he had once seen and feared when the great circus came to town let im have it shulan a man shouted the filthy communist as if answering the command the congressman a wrinkled old man with trembling hands turned abruptly and without aiming fired twice at the snake both shots missed skipping out across the lake and making little splashes in the glassy water again he fired then again and again his pale old body jerking with each report so out of place there on the beach he was faintly terrifying somehow one of the bullets struck the mocassin twitched violently seemed to linger in the faltering day then sank lazily into the lake the murky water swallowed up its body and turned a dull red wynton was terrorstricken the scene in its senseless violence was like the tribal ceremonies you saw in the movies the crowd had gathered around the congressman and were taking his picture others rushed to the lake gazing intently at the bloody water wynton could smell their bodies the tanning lotion they used on their skin these were the americansthat great grinning people who had captured the world without realizing it wynton found himself running breathlessly across the sand headed nowhere but needing suddenly to erase it all he raced along the edge of the lake hoping the lazy ripple would somehow drown out the sound of the cheering he thought of miss stevenson his proper little schoolteacher it was funny how people lied and sometimes they didnt know that they lied arriving at the boathouse he dropped heavily onto the ground and lay trembling on the sand he remained for a long time catching his breath the sun had begun to get lower in the sky and suddenly a cool breeze from across the lake bathed his moist body around him he heard the country soundsa bird call the bark of a dogas evening descended over the lake it was getting on toward four oclock he remembered suddenly and arnie would be along soon and the thought of arnie was like awakening from a nightmare wynton lay motionless and silent at the edge of the lake waiting for his brother back in antiquity there was a saying that is still very much with us today the saying is render unto caesar that which is caesars and render unto god that which is gods this was a tacit assumption of that fact that there was to be a split between the secular and spiritual realms politicians were to minister to the secular realm and churchmen to the spiritual realm even then there were great conflicts between politician and pope the two swords doctrine manifested in the above quote which was a source of conflict down through the ages still lingers with us of late it is demonstrated in the conflict that goes on within the minds and souls of religious leaders today in the area of civil_rights just how much should a clergyman concern himself with the secular movement of negroes into the street to protest how involved should be get in the basic mundane struggle of black people to leave the ghetto and throw off their ghettorization for negro ministers this has often proven to be a thorny question with no fast and sure answer for many white ministers it has proven to be a question that they have refused to meet head on and have attempted to ignore it whenever and wherever possible but there is a discernible change in their reaction to the civil_rights movements more and more white ministers are coming to the front lines some assuming roles of leaders but david reimers white protestantism and the negro oxford university press is not so much concerned with what the various white christian leaders are doing but rather my purpose is to provide the historical perspective for viewing what they are doing it is perhaps too shopworn to repeat that the most segregated hour in america is sunday morning from eleven to twelve when america is worshipping this is a very provocative and pitiful paradox mr reimers book does help to understand how this blightful fact got to be such understanding the background does not of course cure the ailment but it does provide us with a basis for making intelligent diagnosis and the ultimate application of preventive measures to this end mr reimers book furnishes us with a valuable piece of literature it is perhaps necessarily incomplete because this is not the kind of subject that lends itself to a definitive treatment it is easy and intelligible reading and will give the reader certain historical insights into whys and hows of american white christianity and its relationship to american black people this is what the author sets out to do and after some pages you get the impression that he has succeeded the awakenings of africa are numerous and many are lost with that part of history that is conveniently listed as unrecorded it is refreshing to read a book that makes an admirable attempt at recording parts of the more recent political awakening of africa rupert emerson and martin kilson have coedited an interesting book entitled the political awakening of africa prenticehall new jersey the method of chronicling this more recent awakening is to collect the speeches of some of africas leading nationalists and leaders starting back with j e casely hayford and felix eboue and their special brand of nationalism and continuing down to more current leaders and their brand of african political nationalism the book is outstanding for what is included and the light that it sheds on the basic thinking of african leaders some years ago the book points to the former african desire to better conditions within the existing framework of political domination by for eign powers the goal of these early leaders was to convince the ruling powers that the african was worthy of better treatment on one hand and to make the african more deserving and faithful to the colonial country on the other as stated above the book is impressive for what it says but it is also impressive because it does not say as much as one would like hearing the leaders of africa past and present talk about african political problems is a very enlightening and realistic method of understanding what the african thinking and goals really were and the methodology they sought to employ to realize these ends the amount of literary and intellectual salt the reader has to apply to get a full understanding is correspondingly reduced when the subject matter is presented in this fashion the upshot of all this is that one is impressed with what is said and how but really wishes that the authors had given us more while the old theatre axiom always leaving wanting more is good theatre technique the result of the same feeling here is that the reader is left partially pleased but generally frustratedbrooks johnson chester himes the heats on putnams and sons new york tells of the havoc that a misplaced cache of heroin in harlem can cause to do this he uses addicttypes with their full complement of supportive characters sometimes these characters come off and sometimes they dont but himes does manage to keep an element of suspense in the story right up to the very last page he is extremely successful in his attempts at humor this is perhaps the very strong point of the book humor is generally a visual experience and to elicit the kind of humorous response he gets from his use of the printed word demonstrates truly a marvelous talent unfortunately that talent does not obliterate the shortcomings in things such as dialogue and feel the reader is left with the feeling that mr himes would have been better off to have returned to harlem to restudy some of the patterns and vernacular that now are in vogue rather than depending on his memory for things about harlem that were true before he left there for residence in paris harlem is elusive because it is constantly changing and to capture even a minute part one must have uptodate firsthand contact it is easy to discover the fact that mr himes is a talented writer but it is equally apparent that the talent was not uniformly applied in places and things that required extensive hard work we find the author apparently settling for less than his native abilities could produce perhaps if harlem were not so well known to us the book would have been more palatable and believable but the harlem of mr himes does not come off with the reality we have seen in person and read about in the works of some others who strangely enough did not generally appear to have the basic talent that mr himes possesses in his book mr himes fails twice he fails himself and what he is no doubt capable of and he fails harlembrooks johnson
let us speak with each other for a time about the brotherhood of blackness which might almost just as well be called the k fellowship of the wretched and the disinherited fanon called us the damned of the earth all of us club members soul brothers and sisters if you will are members of the brotherhood not because we organized this club biologically on the basis of race and color but because of what western man made of the factors of color and race we are members not because we wanted especially to be members we are members because we have been made to pay the dues for membership in terms of being the victims of the crudest exploitation in the entire history of mans inhumanity to man ours is more or less an involuntary membership we have been for centuries the victims of white supremacy that fountainhead of the western judeochristian world white supremacy racism brought the club together all over this unhappy earth and designated the members of the brotherhood as niggers it was the great recruiter but now the time is long past due for us to call the meeting of the brotherhood to order the first order of business being the bringing about of the downfall of our founder let us stop squabbling among ourselves over favors from the founder a part of our task is to bring about the early demise of great white fatherism we are not racists ours is a struggle to the death against racism so now it is time for us club members africans and africanamericans to cease looking at ourselves and at each other through the jaundiced eyes of the western world which is psychologically white and which looks with illconcealed contempt upon all the members of the brotherhood all the darker peoples who dwell upon this earth the thing that struck me most sharply about the statements written by john a williams and thomas echewa in negro digest on the question of africans and afroamericans was that all three articles read like they had been written by nonclub members of european descent and if not certainly by white men masquerading in the skins of blacks both williams and echewas statements remained most of the time on a highly superficial level as they recorded loads and loads of surface truths and halftruths and numerous irrelevancies which would hardly seem to have much bearing on the fundamental question facing our relationship because this question has nothing at all to do with how africans drink cognac or conduct themselves at bourgeois parties or the boisterousness of the lowerclass negro americans what is the fundamental question the thing is that afroamericans and africans have a common heritage which is africa which had a history thousands of years before the white man discovered it western man works from the proposition that history and civilization began for any corner of the earth at the moment it is discovered by the white man hence the myth that columbus discovered america even though there were people here when the man arrived but you werent discovered you know until mister charles got around to you get the picture you just existed in a kind of limbo in africa and in asia and on the islands of the seas waiting for the man to loom up over the horizon so that history and civilization could begin for you you noble savage you instead of waiting for godot or lefty you waited patiently for whitey let us also stress the fact that afroamericans and africans have a community of experiences visavis the white man it is the community of oppression cruel inhuman racist exploitation slavery and segregation and discrimination on this side of the atlantic at the journeys end colonialism and the slave trade at the genesis in mother africa where man first walked straight and upright on both sides of the ocean the impact on our personalities on our manhood on our selfhood was total if the impact on the african personality was less in its totality than the impact on the afroamerican it was merely a question of degree the fact of the matter is in both cases we still very often seek human dignity and pride in all the wrong places we seek dignity in the eyes of whitey who deprived us of it in the first instance but the slave master can never endow dignity upon the slave nor can the colonial master endow more than a superficial dignity upon the socalled native he who looks for dignity from his master is a fool it is up to the slave and the native to affirm their own dignity all else is false pride and vainglorious stupidity all else is gunga din and uncle tom and mister johnson let us cite a few examples of the whiteness of these learned essays on african and afroamerican relations mr echewa says in my opinion any white who is willing to entertain an african in his home could hardly be accused of negrophobia and further there is of course the story told of an african who sat beside a white couple in church the couple got up and moved to another pew after the service they came to the boy to apologize they had discovered that he was an african they even invited him to dinner in their home but the incident would seem to disprove his proposition that any white person who entertained an african could not be a negrophobe the real question here is did the african accept the invitation certainly what the white couple was saying in effect was you african blacks are all right its just the american niggers we cant stomach if the african did indeed accept the invitation one can only comment that it would seem that his dignity lies in another direction for example some african diplomats visited atlanta georgia not too long ago to observe the american way of free elections it seems that a ghana diplomat went innocently into one of the election booths and got roughed up by the evervigilant atlanta police you see they had mistaken him for an american citizen a faux pas of enormous proportions and of course upon discovering their grave and international error the city fathers hastened to apologize but the african brother said if there is any apology due at all it is due to the black people who live here in atlanta and to whom it happens every day brothers and sisters this is dignity believe me this is in the spirit of the brotherhood of blackness that when you deny the least of us you deny us all john a williams says there is nothing like a trip to africa to make an american negro realize just how american he is of course this is not the essential feeling of some negro americans who have made the trip i imagine it depends on what your values are what you go to africa looking for if you go to africa looking for a replica of the west if you look at africa out of tired cynical western eyes better known these days as white objectivity then you are bound to feel estrangement but if you go there for a new dialogue of values convinced that the values you left behind you in the west are fake and phony and deathly sick then you will have a different feeling about your experience the other thing is some black americans when they go to africa go there with whiter attitudes than those of white americans they are whiter than white americans in much the same way that some excolonial africans are more french than the french and more british than the british john a williams gratuitous comment on his feeling of extreme americanness is a case of unadulterated superpatriotism and shameless flagwaving of the american legion variety and is at one with the gunga din uncle tom bit that floyd patterson pulled when he had the extreme bad taste to bring religion into his battle of words with cassius clay the champ i mean the bit that he was fighting clay again to win the championship back for america as if clay were unamerican because he chose to be called muhammad ali does not floyd know that one of the founding principles of this republic was religious freedom but here we had the roles clearly and classically defined muhammad ali was the sassy arrogant nigger too big for his britches and poor floyd was the new white hope who had assumed the very tough assignment to cut the nigger down to size also went to africa did not need the trip to africa to realize how american was the negro is the most american of americans with the possible exceptions of the socalled indians i knew i was american to begin with very american most american notwithstanding i did not go to africa looking for america went to africa looking for africa and found her in all her wondrous mysterious magnificent diversity for africa is many different things and many different peoples in the summer and fall of arrived in lagos the capital of nigeria and drove in a land rover miles over the african countryside we drove from lagos to ibadan capital of the western region then to historic benin city then to asaba where i first glimpsed the great river niger and crossed on a ferry to onitsha then on to enugu the capital of the eastern region leaving enugu we traveled deep into the niger delta at port harcourt and bonny and calibar from there we came back to enugu and then followed the niger river hundreds of miles all the way to the ancient city of timbuktu the terrain changing before our eyes from the awesomely beautiful mangroves in the gulf of guinea at the edge of the continent to the delta region to the gorgeous lush rain forest to savanna land to the backdoor of the great sahara and the people we were in african countries and everywhere i went people called me brother welcome american brother shall never forget the evening i arrived at margaret ekpos home in aba in the eastern region of nigeria i had driven there with martin leighton a tall rugged friendly bbctype britisher mrs ekpo is a nigerian champion of the cause of womens rights and sits in the house of chiefs of the eastern region she had expected us and had invited some young nigerian politicians to her home to meet us when we martin and i were introduced to them they surged toward me and shook my hand and embraced me and said almost in unison welcome american brother martin stood there beside me invisible and unnoticed growing paler by the second mrs ekpo gestured to her constituents that i was not the only visitor and suddenly they turned embarrassed to martin leighton and said oh yes welcome friend i had many similar experiences whether i was in the crowded cities or in what the british call the bush and i had no need to hang out with englishmen or americans in order to get an orientation as to what africans are like i had not come to africa for that john a williams tells us further that americans and britishers accuse the nigerians of the habit of mixing good cognac with ginger ale a valid complaint according to mr williams presumably this was called to our attention to prove that nigerians were crude in the extreme and unsophisticated maybe even just downright uncivilized on the contrary all it really demonstrated was the shallowness of my american brothers thinking it exposed moreover a terribly brainwashed naivete since when did the matter of how one mixes ones whiskey become a gauge of the degree of civilization of a people as a distinguished writer we expected mr williams to give words newer deeper meanings mr echewa of nigeria seems to say that the afroamerican whom the visiting africans really hold in deep disdain is the lower class negro whatever the phrase encompasses in any event if it were true that stateside africans are disdainful of the lower class negro if we understand the implications of the phrase this great disdain would include the vast majority of our nations black population which would be to say that generally speaking visiting africans are disdainful of the american negro because williams optimism notwithstanding the vast majority of american negroes live out their lives in that lower class category and have never even walked across a college campus in another burst of optimism mr williams says but since the american society from the s has been mostly concerned with social changes or progress it seems inevitable that before long power will be shared by black americans this is the most incredible interpretation of the last years in my country that i have ever come across and by a black american i mean where has the brother been all statistics available point to a very different development even the federal governments own statistics which are usually overly optimistic point to an alarmingly growing gap between the income of the negro people and the income of the nation as a whole and income is precisely where the power is at and power is never shared power is taken as per usual the great frederick douglass was right power concedes nothing without a demand it never did it never will one other thing i believe john a williams to be speaking for a very small minority of negroes including himself perhaps when he states that many negroes were jealous of africans achieving their independence i think most negroes reacted if at all very sensibly with pride and a deep sense of identification with their african brothers the thing for africans and afroamericans to understand it seems to me is that just as there was a community of oppression at the hands of whitey the difference in degree and in the style and structure of the oppression notwithstanding there is also a community of objectives in this brotherhood of blackness in this fellowship of the damned the disinherited the community of objectives is a mutual determination to throw off the black mans burden all over this whiteoriented earth let us face a few cruel indisputable facts there is no need or place for arrogance between us members of the brotherhood africa is not free and independent yet and neither is the american negro news coming out of that turbulent continent tells us every day that european presence is still a fundamental reality particularly in the economic sphere but also politically coups and rumors of coups reflect the grim reality of a european omnipresence playing its centuriesold game of divide and conquer repeat there is no need for arrogance between us duespaying club members of the brotherhood but there is a crying need for understanding fundamental understanding that we members of the brotherhood will stand or fall together that when the prestige of africa rises the prestige of black men rises all over the earth yes even in america and that every blow the black man in america strikes for his freedom is a blow for freedom over the length and breadth of this wonderful and terrible earth africans afroamericans we can not run away from each other even if we wanted to obviously some of us engage in such wistful thinking and work out our frustrations in pathetic acts of wish fulfillment but we wear the badge of our oppression in the color of our skin we are chained together the yoke is on our mutual backs the pain still throbs the scars still show physically psychologically politically socially economically let us stop fighting one another its time to put an end to this petty wrangling like dogs around the masters table snapping at each other in one pathetic scramble for the scraps the master throws at us vying with each other to see who licks the masters hand and gets a fond pat on the head let us rather emphasize the fundamental things which keep the brotherhood together and forge a unity from johannesburg south africa to jackson mississippi to throw off the black mans burden it is left up to us to make this the freedom century it is up to us to forge a unity of our minds and muscles dedicated to the proposition that we shall lay this burden down and free all mankind everywhere it was march and it was cold in boston a group of men left a tavern encountered some british redcoats and shots were fired the first to die was a man named crispus attucks he was a black man this incident was later called the boston massacre and dates the beginning of the american revolution attucks death then started the american revolution but attucks himself didnt really see himself as a revolutionary like so many other men of that day he merely wanted change but faced with obstinance and resistance of a most determined nature revolution was the only course attucks later became something of a hero for negroes despite the fact that he was not acting in a negro cause but rather in a capacity of a citizen agitating for his rights in his office in the state house of massachusetts state attorney general edward w brooke is only a few blocks away from the actual scene of the boston massacre and closer still to the graves of attucks and the men who died with him that night it would appear that brooke will in many ways be a th century attucksa reluctant revolutionary edward w brooke says he is a man who would like to do his job as just another american public servant but there are several factors which prevent this first he is a gifted and dedicated administrator second he is eminently successful as a public servant third he is politically ambitious and fourth he is a negro these elements combined with his republican party membership have set the stage for him to help bring about a revolution that he really wishes wasnt necessary there are several unsettled factors which bear upon the revolution mr brooke is about to help launch perhaps the most important one is his successfully campaigning this fall for the u s senate seat vacated by leverett saltonstall it is generally felt however that he will be the next u s senator from massachusetts for three reasons brooke campaigned on a paltry budget for the attorney generals office of massachusetts in and won he won because the voters of massachusetts had reached the point where they felt that anybody who promised to clean up the corruption in massachusetts was worth a try then he was a republican in a normally democratic state and negro to boot in the voters returned brooke to office with the largest plurality of any republican in the u s and in doing so they gave him the greatest plurality ever achieved by a republican in massachusetts the reason for this is that edward brooke diligently kept his campaign promises and prosecuted those his office found guilty of corruption while holding public office he was no respector of party lines trying republican and democrats as he found them the result was the people of massachusetts have a great deal of confidence in their attorney general as a man who has integrity intelligence and their best interests at heart this explains the first reason given why edward brooke might well become the next u s senator from massachusetts for as it was expressed by a cab driver he did a damned good job the office of the attorney general of massachusetts is decorated in soft muted tones of blue they are distinctly masculine but obviously chosen with taste there is a very strong suggestion of warmth and cordiality with an unrelenting undertone of efficiency and businesslike feel to the office to a very great degree the office reflects the personality and character of the man himself moreover mr brooke is the kind of individual who has the power of projection he is able to put across the kinds of fine touches that are looked for in men but he does so with such ease that the result is confidence in the strength and sincerity of the man as one might expect he is very well tailored in clothes whose colors and cuts impute stability and taste he is a handsome man and in these days when politicians must look good he easily falls into the part with his clean facial features and hair thats attractively greying at the temples he has a look of quiet assurance about him that many men who know what theyre about have the above notwithstanding and perhaps because of it the second most important reason for his probable victory next fall is the fact that he has charisma he has the capacity to excite people upon contact he can communicate with people but in addition he has the talent for doing so at the level and manner in which they seek to be reached he has that indefinable quality that carries a special message for individuals despite the fact that he may meet them in group circumstances in this age of mechanical mass communication he still does a great deal of campaigning in person but in person or not he still projects that feeling to an audience that he holds the key or answer to whatever it is that they are looking for in a leader the third reason he stands a very good chance of winning in the fall is the fact that he is a negro mr brooke has stated that he feels the race issue has neither helped him nor hindered him he wants to be judged on his personal merits as a public office holder and not for the color of his skin despite his genuine wishes on the matter his race is not going to be overlooked and the voters of massachusetts will have his race in mind when they vote massachusetts takes middleclass pride in the fact that it was liberal enough to elect a negro attorney general but this feeling of pride is further compounded because massachusetts has come in for its share of negative publicity on the civil_rights score and scores of massachusettsians are righteously anxious to overcome this stigma further theres nothing more boastful than a white middleclassed american who has taken a negro to his bosom some of my best friends are negroes if the negro turns out to be exceptional this attitude is merely more intense to a great extent this is one kind of feeling that brooke will be facing in predominantly middleclass massachusetts he is the proof of the liberalism and intelligence of the electorate of massachusetts while at the same time he has also freed their consciences and it is likely they will want to ride the crest of this racial euphora to the limits if it appears from the above that mr brooke will walk into the u s senate without any opposition then its time to point out that some of the points mentioned above breed opposition in investigating and prosecuting graft impartially he has made enemies inside and outside of his partysome having considerable influence it is likely that the democrats will run the mayor of boston john collins who is reputed to be a tough campaigner and is a known vote getter he is confined to a wheelchair and this can have advantages for him similar to inherent advantages in brookes color but should brooke win the stage is then set for something of a revolution in american politics for the past thirtythree years or so the republicans have been losing political strength eisenhower was elected on his own popularity and personality rather than as a party candidate and for the exception of his two terms the democrats have held the presidency since roosevelt one of the major causes of this is the fact that the republican party has virtually ignored the immigrant and minority population of the major cities its a political fact of life that there are certain states with their large electoral vote count that a party must carry in order to win a national election these very same states have as the basis of their large vote count large numbers of immigrant and minority groups the republicans in ignoring these people have isolated and insulated themselves from the people who provide the political pivot in any nationwide campaign the republicans have become identified with money and not men there are many old guard republicans who prefer it like this to them the party is a collection of select clubs that get together every four years to propose a candidate these are the men according to brooke who would rather lose the ball game just as long as they decide who is going to pitch it is because of this adamant and arbitrary position taken by the more conservative brooke calls them pseudoconservative leaders of the party that men like brooke lindsay romney and others are seeking a change but changes wont come easy and in fact a revolution will be necessary within the republican party before the needed change will take place reluctant as he might be to take on the power elite within the party as much as he wishes it was not imperative brooke will play a most strategic and vital role in the revolution there are many negroes who are wisely afraid they will be taken for granted by the democrats and thus lose their effectiveness as a voting block the voting statistics of bear this concern out in some cases the democrats rolled up percentages in negro precincts of over on the whole the percentages were well over because of the position and policies of the republican party many black people felt they had no choice but to vote democratic essentially what this does to the negro is to mitigate and dilute his political influence at a time when he is aware that civil_rights and other things he wants are wrapped up in his strength at the ballot bax there are some negro republican leaders around the country who have been watching this development and are just waiting and hoping for the time when the national republican party can produce a platform and attitude that negroes can support recently a republican leader in memphis told this writer man we been catching hell here lately but colored folks are getting just a little bit afraid the democrats figure they got the all them sewed up if you want to see some real fireworks let guys like lindsay start setting policy with a policy consistent with lindsays views there are negro republicans who now hold office who could provide the rallying point for negroes coming back to the party of lincoln the mayor of springfield ohio robert c henry is one he represents the new breed of negro republican who is genuinely interested and informed about local and national issues he is a republican and proud of it but adds not the goldwater type but the real trump card is edward brooke brooke steadfastly maintains that he doesnt want to be known as a negro leader he wants to be evaluated as a man but he also knows that the title of negro leader will fall to him if he becomes a u s senator if this title helps to rebuild the party along more realistic and liberal lines as it inevitably will then he is for it because he is a party man as a man he believes in civil_rights for everyone as a republican he believes in the future of his party as a negro he believes in his right to be a man and a republican without any special attention focused upon him because of his race the role of the revolutionary has been thrust at brooke because much of what he wants as a man a citizen and republican are denied because of the defeatist policies of the ruling circle of his party because he is ambitious intelligent and seems to have history on his side it is likely that he will emerge a winner but win or not his role as a leader in the attucks tradition is already assured thats victory enough for any man the preponderance of educational literature leans toward drastically revising or discarding the grade system they be analyzed in social class and selfconcept or social class and achievement most economically disadvantaged negroes fare poorly in our traditional graded education system tragically a vast majority of innovations placed into the grade system like the first old new england bridges covered with deep snow collapse from the weight of entrenched obsolescence causes of failure despite the fact that educators continually seek to develop school programs which will retain all youth until they graduate from high school approximately onethird of our nations population drop out of school as early as their respective local laws permit equally as alarming is the united states department of labor study entitled school and early employment experience which concluded that adverse school experience was the major reason given for dropping out this observation has been borne out by numerous other studies dropping out of school is an effect and not a cause of school failures there are many reasons why students fail to keep up in grade assignments foremost is the difference in sexual readiness where girls achieve academic maturity earlier than boys if we add other physiological and social differences especially ethnic to the personality matrix it becomes apparent that our concepts of normal students should be reevaluated certainly if as many social practitioners suggest negroes as a whole are even more disadvantaged than white students then it seems educationally unsound to expect such disadvantaged or deprived students to fit a traditional normal student mold while all of those who drop out of school do not reflect poverty backgrounds a disproportionately large number of dropouts are negro students who come from povertystricken homes school is no less painful for a majority of the lowerincome negro students who do not drop out those who stay in school realize that dropping out only accelerates their reaching a fulltime unproductive life leading to social oblivion why they might ask should a person drop out of school and into unemployment for which is hotterthe academic frying pan or the unemployment fire many educators are aware of the weaknesses in the grade system and have tried new techniques to educate socially and economically disadvantaged students but alas our formal educational road to failure is replete with good intentions to improve the traditional system john goodlad a renowned educator surmises that interest ability and other special groups within graded systems do not significantly expedite the learning advantages found in nongraded schools a primary reason for the relative ineffectiveness of modified grade systems is their builtin curricular rigidity other innovations in the grade system have taken on the forms of field visits recreational programs and tutoring in their efforts to correct program deficiencies many traditional schools have undergone processes closely resembling neighborhood conservation activities in an urban renewal program they have sought to conserve the best of the existing system and to abolish any outmoded portions and like neighborhood conservation these efforts merely delay the time before complete redevelopment must take place current studies further indicate that schools which are based upon grades do not usually enhance the selfconcepts of low achieving negro students it seems that the elements of standard curricula and periodic grading guarantee a greater percentage of students who will have negative feelings of their self worth each year thousands and thousands of negro students leave school believing that they cannot succeed in middleclass competition to prove their point they display report cards which are liberally decorated with failing or nearfailing grades some critics of the grade system maintain that such a rigid system cannot satisfactorily provide culturally disadvantaged students with adequate visual and auditory perception or language and speech patterns in our lockstep grade system the criticism continues lowerincome negro students drop further and further behind experience less and less success until they earn the titles of underachievers slow learners and poor readers their inability to succeed in the grade system perpetutes cultures of poverty so why not try nongraded education when grading is dropped criticizing the grade system john goodlad and robert anderson authors of the nongraded elementary school wrote first a certain amount of progress is held standard for a years work then the content of the work is laid out within the grade to be covered and to a degree mastered the slow are pulled and stretched to fit the grade sometimes because their godgiven limbs lack enough elasticity they are nonpromoted left behind where presumably another year of stretching will do the trick as for the gifted students the authors conclude that they are compressed and contracted to fit the grade in time they learn to adapt to a pace that is slower than their natural one by at least states had one or more communities experimenting with nongraded education the earliest primary unit elementary schools were given many names including the primary schools of green bay wisconsin wichita kansas provo utah the junior primary unit at dale mabry elementary tampa florida the ungraded primary in corona california unified school district and the primary unit plan at marblehead massachusetts the first high schools to try nongrading were the melbourne nova and satellite high schools all of florida chippewa valley high school mt clemens michigan and middletown high school in rhode island which became the first completely nongraded six year secondary school in unlike the grade structure the nongraded structure is based upon the premises that a year of school life depending upon the student may mean much more or much less than a year of progress in a subject area a students progress is not seen as being unifiedhe may spurt ahead in one subject area and lag behind in another adequacy of a students progress is determined by comparing a students attainment to his ability learning is viewed vertically or longitudinally rather than horizontally slow progress is provided for by allowing the student a longer time to do given blocks of work thereby minimizing failures rapid progress is provided for by encouraging bright students to move ahead without regard to a grade label finally the flexibility in programming allows for easier implementation of curriculum improvements by individualizing the curriculum nongraded schools seek to abolish failure as an educational concept they also seek to accentuate success of course not all students will be successful in achieving their academic goals but their attempts are placed within a proper achievementability content several studies indicate that nongraded schools are more effective than graded schools in raising a students selfesteem and maintaining it at a high level even after unsuccessful task efforts despite positive evaluation the larger school systems remain curious but cautious about nongrading chicago and detroit public schools for example have only recently decided to try nongrading on a limited basis at the elementary level however most large school systems appear to be neither curious nor cautious and are clinging to their graded programs in addition to its limited use and evaluation in large urban schools the foremost disadvantages of the nongraded system are report cards and community reluctance nongraded schools have not found an optimum solution to the marking problem they are still trying to design report cards that will properly reflect how the students level of achievement compares with others in the system how the student stands in relation to his own ability and how the student compares with others in the group perhaps the foremost disadvantage of the nongraded system is the fact that it deviates from current educational practices severing the umbilical cord of traditionalism is sometimes disastrous to break through the comforts associated with the status quo and to bring about change causes a cry from most individuals who have conceived and nurtured the graded system in chicago and detroit for example when first introduced many parents claimed that they could not understand the basic philosophy of nongraded schools teachers threw up their arms in despair at being trained to teach in such a system educators of teachers were slow to advocate methods or philosophy of nongrading and taxpayers resented the use of public funds to experiment with their youth but beneath the vocal din and scholastic subterfuge is the fear of the unknown most americans do not mind jumping on a bandwagon if it is moving few school districts want to be the pilot or experiment to test the merits of nongrading in almost the same tone as the antinegro question of would you want your daughter to marry one community leaders study nongraded plans and look at each other asking would you want your child to attend one the better bridge builders as a bit of academic hindsight it seems easier for a social practitioner to criticize an existing educational institution than to objectively analyze it and then if needed offer practical alternatives for achieving more effectiveness it is even more difficult for him to criticize his stated alternatives the latter task is psychologically disconcerting it highlights the gaps between social theory and social practice and equally important it reminds the social practitioner of his own inadequacies yet of all the changeagents action researchers or social engineers have built the sturdiest bridges between social theory and social practice bridging the gap between educational theory and practice requires a knowledge of the past an appreciation for the present and a projected awareness of the future to state merely that our school system should shift from graded programs to nongraded programs is to overestimate the value of nongraded programs and to underestimate the value of graded programs nongraded schools should not be viewed as being completely new bridges for socializing students but instead as being significantly improved bridges there was a time when vocational training remedial classes and cultural enrichment programs were called drastically new approaches to formal education quickly and correctly educators reminded us that these innovations evolved out of an existing system when viewed in this manner education is in a continual state of change thus nongraded schools become a means to better education and not better education in itself traditional education some critics claim is not even adequate for traditional or normal students therefore when forced to educate nontraditional students such as lowerincome negro students the graded system shakes as if beseiged with delirium tremens following an examination of the system its custodians fail to provide it with the much needed corrective surgery which according to most studies would kill the system in the meantime the system continues to hobble along causing students to drop out or to graduate without inculcating needed basic skills gradually cases are being made to declare the graded system educationally incompetent in addition the taxpayers are being asked to give educators the power of attorney to commit it to the past in hearing the testimony local communities must decide if the graded system is guilty and must be put away for the good of society or if it is not guilty and can continue its efforts to socialize students if the verdict is guilty counsel for the defense of graded schools probably will ask for a suspended sentence and an opportunity to undergo rehabilitation treatments social scientists and educators speaking as amicus curiae do not recommend trying to rehabilitate the graded schools their evidence leans heavily towards implementing nongraded programs with deliberate speed the diversified needs of all students particularly the povertystricken call for this greatly improved approach to education yet it is a reality of community organization that it will take a while before many communities accept and commit resources to nongraded schools in the interim period the students suffer an even more sobering conclusion was drawn by august kerber and wilfred smith in educational issues in a changing society if we were to imagine the traditional school system as a personalization we would find an old man with a heavy load suffering and creaking at the joints harassed by spectators and even wellwishers at all sides and confused by opposing bits of advice this of course is an oversimplification yet even the ideal school system in our society is filled with all kinds of problems the strange fact is that education manages to keep going summary since our culturally disadvantaged students must compete in a basically middleclass oriented society they should be prepared for such competition few educators will disagree with this premise the major disagreement comes out of a quest for the best means of educating disadvantaged students there are those who would argue that nongraded schools are artificial systems which merely delay the time when the disadvantaged student will compete in a lifelike situation following this line of reasoning nongraded schools are both pretentious and dysfunctional for middleclass survival but perhaps the most frequent argument against nongraded education is that disadvantaged children do not need special curricula only more of the traditional curricula and for a longer period of time on the other hand reminiscent of a political slogan a few educators are beginning to chant that it is time for a change like alice in wonderland they are beginning to realize that culturally disadvantaged students must keep running just to keep up the changes most frequently suggested are those which would bend or break the grade lockstep by providing for students who need special assistance in small classes who need more emphasis on basic skills who have average ability and who are above average nongraded proponents believe that their system is best suited for meeting societal and individual needs despite its merits the nongraded system has flaws the basic issue then becomes can we as a nation afford not to try new approaches to education which may allow disadvantaged students to enter the mainstream of democratic life if the answer is no then we should encourage our school boards to give nongrading a fair trial and evaluation in all the analyses postmortems and search for causes conducted in los angeles after the watts riots there has been a solid reluctance to admit that the local events foretell changes for the negro in america the attempt to explain that violence entirely in terms of local conditions not only ignores changes within the national negro community but actually obstructs a real understanding of those changes the watts riots represent a marked and obvious shift in attitude among negroes in los angeles and given the recent history of the negro it follows that from los angeles there stem national implications thus it becomes immaterial whether watts is or is not a slum area whether criminal elements were or were not responsible for the rioting or whether police brutality did or did not occur the important thing is how negroes are beginning to regard what they at least see as facts and this new attitude is by no means confined to los angeles the change is based on shifts in the negros overall power position from the expanded use of the vote has come political power the negro has made his purchasing power felt in certain locales and his consumption pattern has affected the national market in some key commodities and the unrelenting civil_rights movement has brought domestic advances in the negros broad social position in addition to moral advantages acquired through a sympathetic world opinion as a result he is learning about the rewards of bargaining in the american way of life but the favorable shifts in the negros position have given him only a taste of the tangy flavor of power wielding its weaponsthe vote boycotts nonviolent demonstrationshe glimpses an even larger arsenal of possible weapons these alternative weapons and strategies increase his bargaining position if he can make violence work as an alternative to peaceful demonstration he seems willing to try it the northern parallel of the negroes with guns experiment in north carolina louisiana and mississippi showed itself in watts last august where peaceful weapons do not operate violence is an alternative and though this may come as a surprise to a public almost surfeited with reports of victory in the war for civil_rights the peaceful weapons were doing little for watts i came home to watts after two years abroad a week before the riots began during the years away i had read much about the quickening pace of the civil_rights movement and upon my return i was eager to see what changes had been made i was soon let down the dismal sameness of the neighborhood disturbed me most watts had not a new building the community issues which were old two years ago were now traditional police brutality was still alleged by a persistent few and just as emphatically denied by an official few on first appearance it seemed not only that watts had been spectator to whatever impact the civil_rights movement was making on the negro community but also that it did not in the slightest share the dazzling growth of the los angeles area watts seemed passive neither swinging with the new progressive ethos of the civil_rights movement nor enriching itself by way of the southern california bonanza it was i thought the same watts i had known as a boy to grow up in watts then was to have no especial pride in the community it was a physical locale and a habit of thought that one was expected to outgrow local heroes moved away went to the westside and seldom were heard from again when i graduated from high school and was preparing to leave for college my advisers told me that if people asked where i was from i should say south los angeles not watts anyone aspiring to success in the outside world was expected to dissociate himself from watts nothing good was ever known of watts it was in the news only as the scene of a knifing or shooting and in watts no boyhood dream was complete unless it included some kind of deliverance from the burdensome stigma the important differences between that old watts and the watts of today began to emerge for me during a conversation before the riots with a high school classmate who had preceded me to college we had always thought alike but now after the intervening years we seemed separated by our different experiences he talked about conditions in the city for afroamericans as he called negroes and said that he thought there were more important things than a home and fine car he was concerned that i should always remember my beginnings in watts and reminded me of his own experiences after college though a successful student he was never hired in the field of his academic specialty disappointed he joined the army and there suffered an injury that has left him slightly crippled soon after the injury he was discharged and later he married he is still jobless the ordeal has left him embittered at one time active in the civil_rights movement he now pays it little attention most of his friendly relations with white civil_rights workers have been severed he is indifferent to integration yet matters having to do with race interest him now even more than they did two years ago what now concerns him is the selfsufficiency of the negro community after the riots he called to express his satisfaction but regretted that the riots had stopped too short the true history of watts is the evolution of a negro community and it thus makes better sense to discuss the los angeles riots within the context of the negro in america than as a part of the civil_rights movement for watts like the larger community may be affected by the movement but it is nevertheless an entity apart from the movement it has absorbed some of the achievements of the drive for civil_rights and repelled others discarding the civil_rights framework in order to explain the riots may appear ironic but in fact the separation between the negro community and the civil_rights movement is easily discernible the real irony of the situation is that the successes of the movement are often mistakenly seen as satisfying some condition of the negro community when to the dismay of many the recent riots followed on the heels of the passage of the voting rights act the comment frequently made was you give these people this great piece of legislation and what do they do they go out and riot it doesnt make good sense but the civil_rights movement and the voting rights act are one thing the negro community and the riots are quite another hence the riots cannot be discussed in terms of the old language the cause advances setbacks cannot explain the changes the riots introduced a new language it is hardly intelligible to anyone outside the negro community some evidences of the vocabulary of the new language can be gleaned from the tone of current negro literature the fire hi ext time negroes with guns are recent titles that have meaning in the new context the language is bitter and it smacks of desperate conduct and action yet even worse the nations ear is not trained to recognize it for the first time los angeles heard from a littleknown black man a kind of gnome he was a recluse in watts a negro qua negro silent invisible and until now always passive most of the time he has been the object of somebody elses action relentlessly acted upon when he met whites they were usually in a uniformthat of a policeman or a businessmansignifying some role antagonistic to the community it was no accident that the riots chose the police and the merchants as their targets initially it was an incident with policemen that provoked the riots but the policemans presence is always at issue he comes to the negro community to impose a legal order so incompatible with its style of life and patterns of conduct as to make it seem that he is imposing an alien civil code the charge often made that protests against police brutality are just a convenient cover up for a prevailing civic irresponsibility ignores the fact that the law and its agents reflect the dominant american mode of life and that the negro as a community is excluded from fully participating in that dominant mode so the law that appears to be a form of order for the largest sectors of the population is in fact an inconvenience and a burden when applied to negroes unlike the policeman whose presence is constant the merchant confines his activities in watts to business hours the merchant was damned not so much for his unethical dealingsto be sure the merchants are no more unethical in watts than they are anywhere elsebut ironically enough for his strict application of the american business ethic to watts in particular watts has been made an exception to the rules of the larger community but few allowances for the difference are ever made with respect to business it is hardly recognized that business practices appropriate to wilshire beverly hills and other sections of los angeles are in nowise suitable to watts the merchant righteously tells his customer in watts that his treatment is no different from the treatment of customers at the store across town the fallacy in this pitch to the negro customer is so obvious that it rarely goes unnoticed if the merchant is to do business in watts the terms of his relationship with the customer must be keyed to the individual pocketbooks of the local citizens examples abound in watts of goods being reclaimed and payroll checks being attached after a customer has failed on a single monthly payment negroes recognize the subtle alternating pattern of partiality with impartiality and they talk about it the watts riots were an assertion in still another direction in addition to expelling the white presence they created and exposed new reactions of the negro to himself the traditional roles were switched the negro was in the active role for the first time doing the chasing and wreaking the havoc to a people who have always been acted upon rarely doing anything for itself or to communities outside the riots were a bold departure from a long tradition of inertia admittedly the fact that the activity was destructive is not irrelevant but it is less important than the fact that rioting is for the negro in watts a form of expression no one understands his problem or bothers to care few of his local leaders have the imagination or vision to articulate his special feelings to the outside world besides it is the kind of story most americans will protest that they would rather not hear there in watts the negro is trapped and without a means of expressing himself or of making himself understood to the environment that surrounds him because of the inadequacy of the avenues open to him he resorts in desperation to rioting what seemed like a sudden reaction to his plight had in fact been developing in the negro all along it was sudden only in its manifestation by his relegation to watts the negro is forced to be conscious of the differences that place him there the isolation serves to accentuate his awareness of his homogeneity and it follows from this that the negro resolves most of the differences that relegate and isolate him into one unique differencethat of race to this race consciousness the negro attaches many thingsthe sum of his reactions to this world we all live in and to himself as the world about us changes to be sure the reactions he derives from this race consciousness are not consistently rational but then what human reactions are consistently rational to be a negro and aware of its serves as an organizing mechanism that simplifies many things for him explains why certain other things happen just to him and no one else and gives to him a justification not only for reacting differently but for acting differently as well the importance of the los angeles riots lies in the fact that it was the first time in watts that race consciousness has been a basis for acting previously the consciousness had been present but always passive it was a basis solely for understanding what was done to the negro on racial grounds what minuscule action race consciousness did take as in organizations that adhered to racist doctrines was more important as reaction to the black mans special predicament on most busy street corners in the neighborhood one could buy a paper and read about the negros new and growing awareness of himself but for the most part it was confined to newsprint and the muslim temple that it has now exploded in racial violence only reinforces and heightens the race consciousness the attempt to dispel it comes too late while the rioting lasted it divided the city into two very obvious camps but the intense race consciousness that was manifested during the riots has not been erased now that the riots have ended it lives on in internalized forms in new images and new possibilities there is a tragedy in the new prospect it is sure to make future relations between the negro community and the city somewhat strained at a time when both communities could profit by increased understanding of each other the distance that separated whites from negroes before the riots is even greater today the very understanding the negro solicits by rioting is barred by the effects of that rioting in an attempt to explode myths he has only magnified them by resorting to violence that traditional mode of human expression he has made future expression and communication more difficult the problem of communication is not new indeed the aftermath of the rioting showed how vast the communication gap has always been for one thing the news media lacked proper resources one of the major metropolitan dailies had to hire its negro advertising agent to cover the area because it had no negroes on the reporting staff a national magazine with offices in los angeles nevertheless had no coverage for two full days because there was no one in the local office who could enter the riot area also the news media were wholly without the experience to deal with the negro population after the riots had ended watts was practically overrun by press tv and radio in search of the facts but these media could find no reliable sources of information it was apparent that most of the reporters were going about the task of covering the riot area in total darkness the lack of facilities and techniques for communication may have added to the difficulties many of the published facts about the riots were not even approximately true most outsiders simply could not distinguish between forms the lack of experience with watts led to gross generalizing for example most officials outside concluded that there was no leadership in watts and this may be sufficient as far as the outside community is concerned but they fail to realize that the citizenry of watts is not a flock watts too is a community and therefore its leadership takes a variety of forms there are political leaders business leaders religious leaders et al whereas in the large community the leadership resides most often in business executives and professionals the same kind of leadership in watts falls to the barber the auto mechanic the bartender it is not so much that leadership does not exist but that the indigenous leadership takes forms which are largely unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the community pattern the same social factors that make the law seem alien and the business practices unfair can account for the outsiders failure to discover leadership in watts the problem in communication now is not so much a lack of interest in obtaining information it is rather one of dealing skillfully with an unfamiliar community riots in los angeles and the threat of riots elsewhere should serve to remind the nation of the negros growing restlessness the sad facts of the los angeles story indicate that violence can easily occur in all the big cities of the north and the problems are exceedingly difficult for it is impossible to deal with the negro as though he were something other than himself to expect the negro to become white in his thinking is to expect too much understanding can proceed only if there is a firm recognition of genuine differences a failure to recognize the differences and to understand what they mean to the negro will inevitably lead to more riots the tragedy of the rj r american negro is i t not at e s black in jv a white mans country but rather its the fact that he is helplessly trapped in a fantasy land of torment and terror a land which persists in trying to control everyone everywhere but merely succeeds in corrupting and destroying everything it touches conceived in genocide and slavery and now dedicated to the proposition that its ordained mission is to rule the world or act as world policeman as the daily press so quaintly phrases it america has now marked itself the thug of the th century by its wanton murder of unarmed peoples in distant lands who hardly knew this country existed let alone had any intention of dropping one pebble on its soil and needless to say this criminal attitude of total disregard for the legal and human rights of other peoples is making the white american detested in every corner of the world then counterpoised to this public spectacle of escalating horror is the private chaos resulting from the vicious subterranean battle waged by americas brainwashed overeducated white women who are made to live in a state of virtual servitude by their insecure racehating warmongering men folk and caught beneath these eternally clashing forces the negro is like a man tied to a sinking ship who has the option of going down with everyone else or breaking his chains and leaping overboard into the unknown uncharted waters yet up till this very moment with but few exceptions our leaders have constantly told us we must prepare ourselves so we will be ready to move into the mainstream when the time is ripe and it is exactly at this point that they betray themselves and this brings us to the second tragic aspect of the afroamerican his leaders speak for the oppressor knowingly or otherwise we are never asked if we want to move into the mainstream for due to the incredibly egotistical nature of the white man he has always assumed that all black folk are simply champing at the bit waiting for that glorious day when his benign white brother will reach out his hand and say come i welcome you at ast into my promised land and this is why the late malcolm_x and the black muslims are so despised by white america malcolm and the muslims dared to say what an everincreasing number of afroamericans have long yearned to say the white man be damned i want no part of him and his evil ways for who indeed in his right mind wants to move into americas polluted mainstream where every man woman and child stand neck deep in some one elses blood the stench here is as stilling as any that ever came from a german concentration camp only the sound is muffled but let us suppose for a moment that we should consider following that lets get ready advice how do we prepare ourselves to enter the modern house of horror that is america today obviously and of utmost importance we must learn to forego the pleasures of petty thievery no more this business of grabbing a loaf of bread and a few ham hocks and running for which we always receive ten or fifteen years when caught and we are always apprehended we never benefit from any of that cant finditis luck which always seem to befall white folk when they have victimized us from here on in we must play it the way the mainstreamers do work out a system we must plan our deviltry with premeditation and in great complicated detail so we can abscond with millions a la the bank tellers the salad oil boys the billie sol estes the teapot domers the dixon yates the bobby bakers the five percenters and the price fixers etc then too we must stop all this tomfoolery of bushwhacking each other in the future we must band together and blow up their churches and sunday schools in session and play target practice with their passing motorists and lurk in the darkened bushes and shoot their unsuspecting men and women and children in the back and then we must be prepared to sit on hung juries so we can let us go free and then give ourselves our profound congratulations for being so so white and in addition to this subtle warfare at home we must now learn how to wage allout war on foreign soil in the name of peace and democracy the first and most urgent lesson to learn here is that we must accuse them of aggression while we test our flame throwers our napalm bombs and other horror weapons on their women and children and no matter how far from home we are or how many cities and villages we wreck or how many people we blow to bits we must always remember to shout in righteous indignation those people must be taught that we will not budge an inch until they learn how to live in peace with their neighbors then when they have learned this lesson we will rebuild all their bridges all their hospitals and roads and villages and homes and schools and all their everything except the people we have incinerated but we mustnt let a little thing like that bother us because after all they werent like us you know and war is hell and besides look how it strengthened our economy another cardinal rule we must remember to adhere to at all times whether home or abroad is to bump off anybody we cant buy or anybody we no longer have any need of and then finally and foremost if we are ever to really make it big in the mainstream we must remember that at all times and at all costs we simply must keep the nigger down if you dont keep both feet on him day and night he will always take a little bit more and a little bit more until the next thing you know hes living next door and marrying our sister now that we have the magic formula for becoming a mainstreamer theres only one question left who is going to be our nigger but i should think the answer to that is as plain as day the black folk still stuck in the ghetto will be the black mainstreamers nigger of tomorrow to be sure more than one cani did observer of the american scene has noted that this nation has always been controlled by an elite group and never was this more true than it is today and obviously this elite group has historically been white males of anglosaxon origin the anglosaxon origin has given way somewhat under heavy pressure but the white male continues to rule this country in the same old fashion of granting preferential privilege to a select few and the overwhelming majority of white women in america are so brainwashed and so afraid that someone will label them masculine if they stop shouting the praises of their lifelong state of semivoluntary servitude to the male that they have become even more insistent than the white male that the nigger must be kept in his place imagine their consternation conscious or otherwise when they finally get the message that that equality business was meant for males white only that the female must remain a subservient subsidiary at all times and especially if she marries in which case she will even have to give up her own identity and follow the ageold slave custom of adopting the masters name and not only must she serve her husband hand and foot night and day but she must also loudly acclaim the neverending joy of such servitude now such a role may not be so onerous for some female who had trouble making it out of kindergarten but for these bright bas and phds who shout such rot nowadays its really not unlike watching a game of russian roulette unfolding for sooner or later the big game comes one such bang is the many mamas boys these bright serfs turn out which was so ably described in the feminine mystique by betty friedan some two years ago now the point where we are directly concerned in all this business is that so many of these inferior housewives vent their frustrations on the most convenient underdog they can find the afroamerican it isnt mere coincidence that in both the north and the south so many white women have made such tenacious efforts to keep the schools and neighborhoods segregated and just where did you think all those little old ladies in tennis shoes came from these insecure housewives realize all too clearly that if the negro gains his freedom they will be the only serfs left in this vast wasteland and in addition these same women having no life of their own inasmuch as they have been divested of their inalienable right to be free individuals rob their children and their husbands of their sense of self and peace of mind thus we see middleclass teenagers wrecking america in a far more prodigious manner than any black slum kid could ever hope to do and their fathers the men who rule the nation are so harried and unsure of themselves thanks to their dispossessed nagging women that not only are they dead set against ever letting the black man rise but these same men of power must constantly prove their manhood in any manner they can and usually in the easiest way by kicking the downtrodden further down for a grim example both arthur m schlesinger and theodore c sorensen have come up with sad afterthoughts concerning their part in the bay of pigs fiasco during john f kennedys presidency in his book a thousand days john f kennedy in the white house schlesinger called the invasion a terrible idea and reproached himself for not having protested more strenuously at the time while sorensen wrote in his book kennedy concerning that illfated episode that unfortunately among those privy to the plan in both the state department and the white house doubts were entertained but never pressed partly out of fear of being labeled soft or undaring in the eyes of their colleagues and he went on to point out that kennedy too feared that cancellation of the invasion would make him look soft at home and abroad he felt that his disapproval of the plan would be a show of weakness inconsistent with his general stance newsweek august and one bright day these same insecure men or men like them are apt to find themselves in a situation involving the bomb and in order to save face and look strong they may just as casually blow up the world and wont those brainwashed white women be surprised when they find that after all these years of proclaiming my place is in the home the home is going to be the first place blasted off the map when americas bombs come to roost idney poitier millions of people know that name it belongs to the only negro ever to win an academy award as a leading man in a hollywood motion picture that in itself is a pachydermatous accomplishment but even more it is a stupendous victory in the negros struggle for human justice poitier as any movie fan knows won his oscar for his outstanding portrayal of an itinerant worker for a group of poor foreign nuns in the film lilies of the field however there are those who claim that he was only good not great in the film and that he received the coveted award principally because of the times and not because of his talents they are dead wrong about his talent but they are right about the social climate it cannot be denied that the negro quest for civil_rights reached a pinnacle in it also stands uncontradicted that in the sixtyodd years of cinema the images of negroes on screen have been changingfrom fools to comedians to integral characters and now heroic protagonists still there is much to be desired of all the negro actors and actresses in this country only a handful have been featured in integrated pictures and in those instances their roles have been limited to segregation themes it is to poitiers credit that he has somehow managed to cast off the psychological chains that bind negroes to certain ethnic parts in films his success quite possibly could revolutionize the entire movie making industry for the moment however hollywood continues to follow a policy of white makes right this absurdity is manifested either in flagrant racism or in the utter ignoring of the negros existence so much so the industry has been under constant attack from the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and the congress of racial equality core and as of late some of the big white stars themselves in addition numerous resolutions have been adopted calling for an end to negro stereotyping as well as an end to discriminatory practices by the trade unions talent guilds and other agencies until studios and producers for years had stalled the efforts of negroes to obtain a semblance of equal opportunity in hollywood each year there were meetings between the parties involved but nothing ever came of them a few jobs as extras opened up for some negroes in b movies but the craft unions continued their closed shop policy finally the naacp stepped in and vowed to boycott theatres all across the country if action was not taken immediately the moguls not wanting to be hit where it hurts the mostin the pocketbookbegan a frantic search for negro talent no longer were there scenes of city streets or subways where there was not a single negro in sight moreover two negroes wendell franklin and otis greene were picked off for executive posts on two major projects franklin served as an assistant director for the film the greatest story ever told still to be released and greene was an assistant to producer james fonda on screen gems hazel series the target show of the naacps demand for more movie jobs at the time greene was quoted as saying that work available to negro actors had increased tenfold and he was right only thats like saying that a firm with one negro on its staff which then hires an other has increased its negro personnel some per cent discrimination is still a way of life in hollywood for instance there were negroes listed by central casting corporation in during all of and the first part of that figure was increased to the grand total of central an agency of the motion picture producers association has whites on its roles and orientals in the craft unions a training program has been instituted for all apprentice aspirants regardless of race but according to a spokesman for mppa the program is in its infancy and has very few unions under its wing this has led the naacp to threaten decertification proceedings by appealing directly to the national labor relations board one such target is the international association of theatrical stage employes iatse with which the unions are affiliated meanwhile iatse steadfastly insists that it does not practice discrimination but produces no figures to prove it and so it goes hollywoods discrimination against negroes remains for the most part true to tradition compounded upon a premise which by its very nature is not only bad but normally unjust that premise is comprised of many parts including union discrimination the southern shuffle restrictions imposed by financiers and ignorance the southern shuffle perhaps more than any of the others is responsible for the negros plight where movies are concerned film after film following the turn of the century specialized in maligning ridiculing and disparaging the race not only were the true hopes and ambitions of the negro suppressed but the characterizations of negroes as given were the vilest of caricatures the most odious stereotypes purposely drawn to show the negro as a brainless idiot and how they succeeded howls of laughter were heard from movie houses when the characters rastus and sambo were introduced to the nation while the disfranchisement and segregation of the negro was carried out at the same time it was a hideous crime but like murder in mississippi and chicago too it went unsolved the trend of negro treatment on the screen took a sharp turn in the years between and unfortunately it wasnt for the best uncle tomism came into being then such trash as for massas sake in slavery days and the debt spewed from the soundless studios uncle toms cabin itself appeared during those years but instead of the scathing indictment of slavery that its author harriet beecher stowe wanted it to be the movie became a disgraceful display of subservient loyalty then came d w griffiths birth of a nation termed a classic by some it aided and abetted bigots who for obvious reasons saw fit to perpetuate hatred between negroes and whites a former president of the us woodrow wilson lauded the film and reportedly said it is like writing history with lighting the new york times said it is by far the greatest motion picture work yet put forward variety stated birth of a nation is a new milestone in film artistry a great epoch in picture making but if the movie was a heavensent depiction to whites it was a hellridden falsehood to negroes nearly all viewed it as simply gross propaganda aimed at glorifying the outlawed and disgraced kukluxklan a storm of protest arose when the film was initially released and many theatres banned itfor a whilein several northern states yet the effectiveness of the picture is best seen by the fact that in there were some kkk members throughout the united states from that time until after the second world war the hollywood scene as related to the negro people remained just about the same but in came a wave of darkie interest films the first fulllength production was a war vehicle entitled home of the brave it was followed by lost boundaries pinky and intruder in the dust while they did not lean towards uncle tomism and lowlife comedy as represented by willie best stepin fetchit and mantan moreland they nevertheless were symbols of segregation at the time that they were made there was not one negro writer producer director technical direc tor or camera man listed as a guild member what is even worse very few negroes resided in hollywood and they for the most part were maids and butlers as for a negro becoming a star well that was out of the question that is until poitier arrived whereas the studios would spend thousands upon thousands of dollars building the white actor or actress into a star they spent nothing on the negro personality obviously the star system was built on color and black was not the in color it is well to note that it was stanley kramer producer of home of the brave who added a touch of racial maturity to hollywood by casting poitier opposite tony curtis in the defiant ones the year was and by then it had become politically possible to star a negro in an integrated movie still it would be five years later before poitier would be given a role which called for a top flight actor irrespective of race creed or color from all that has transpired since then it would seem that sidney has it made in movies this is hardly the case his roles will continue to be hand picked if for no other reason than miscegenation and for hollywood that is a dirty word out there race mixing is only for real lifenot the screen this malady is typified by the attitude towards the interracial movie one potato two potato turned down as a selection for the cannes film festival by the u s motion picture export association the producers of the movie larry peerce and jack weston had to visit a horde of european sources before they could get their work distributed in cannes a french selection committee readily agreed to show the film and it received widespread acclaim the female lead barbara barrie won the best actress award for her performance there potato told the story of a man who had left his wife and child to go to south america in his absence his wife divorced him returning four years later he discovered his wife had married a negro bernie hamilton so he sued for custody of the child contending that the child could not have a normal upbringing in an interracial marriage he won out of course this honest film was an independent production and thats hollywood today sidney poitier may be like a pair of brand new shoes to the movie colony but the same old feet are in them the movie industry remains like most of americas institutionsby for and about white people hugh h smythe a trjr skinny kid from the

kids if the kids react to you youve got it made once you have the kids on your side their parents know you cant be all bad kids react well to me and then smythe adds with a chortle kids and dogs the above lines from coleridges kubla khan are about as insignificant a passage of poetry as youll find like music they are singular and selfjustifying conveying nothing at all outside of the images they invoke they are an example chosen at random of what susan sontag refers to as the sensuous surface of artart as ritual as incantation independent of any social moral or even psychological obligation in against interpretation the noonday press the noted contributor to such magazines as commentary the nation and partisan review presents a brilliant defense of this aspect of creativity and a convincing argument against traditional approaches to literary criticism interpretation as miss sontag sees it is not an absolute value rather it must itself be evaluated within the context of history and culture in our own milieu with its hyperthropy of the intellect criticism is becoming increasingly impertinent to the stated product increasingly a shadow world of freud christian precept and contemporary social theory that bears little relationship to the creative genesis to treat works of art in this fashion is not wholly irrelevant but it is obviously putting art to use such treatment has little to do with what actually takes place when a person possessing some training and sensibility looks at a work of art miss sontag attributes the problem to what she calls the erroneous separation of form from content creating the illusion of values outside the stated work which is essentially formal indeed practically all metaphors for style amount to placing matter on the inside style on the outside it would be more to the point to reverse the metaphor as cocteau writes decorative style has never existed style is the soul and unfortunately for us the soul assumes the form of the body indeed contends the author in what adds up to a repudiation of the entire tradition of criticism as set by aristotle the sense in which a work of art has no content is not different from the sense in which the world has no content both are and while allowance is made for a twin function of art content is merely the pretext the lure which engages the consciousness in an essentially formal process of transfiguration this is how we can in good conscience cherish works of art which considered in terms of content are morally objectionable to us to illustrate this last point miss sontag cites gide proust joyce mallarme but she finds a broader example for her argument in contemporary drama and in the avantgarde cinema particularly the cinema that ultimate proponent of art as magic when cocteau in orpheus has his actors leap through mirrors it is like ritual a visual affirmation of the impossible similarly bresson the diary of a priest etc does not intend his characters to be implausible im sure but he does i think intend them to be opaque godard and antonioni employ ideas but less as content than as decor props sensual material and even the films of bergman though crammed with lame messages about the modern spiritstill triumph over the pretentious intentions of their director not surprisingly miss sontag scores a plus for the new wave of french writers nathalie sarraute alain robbegrillet etc mainly for their attention to the purely visual aspects of experience but she criticizes the novel at large in its antiquity of form in its failure to acknowledge the preeminence of form as the most reactionary of the modern art media traditional criticism contends the author in its demand for significance at the expense of energy and sensual capability is the revenge of the intellect upon art even more it is the revenge of the intellect upon the world for art like the world is basically an aesthetic phenomenonhamilton bims an old propaganda adage is repetition is a form of emphasis in a very real sense we have been bombarded with the most emphatic kind of propaganda possible on harlema ghetto exceptionally prolific in inspiring writers sociologists pamphleteers etc gilbert osofsky joins this long line with harlem the making of a ghetto harper and row he must be aware of the hordes of his predecessors because he has done an exceptional job of research and he must have felt that his book would make a contribution toward a better understanding of harlem in a sense his book does make a contribution it is one of the better documented works and reflects the kind of massive research he did making his collection of harlemtonia a scholars work much of the substance however is rather commonly known to negroes and to others who have any interest in harlem andor negro big city ghettos using certain problems he does show dramatically how little things have changed for example in charles dickens visited the negro slums of new york and wrote women and men slink off to sleep forcing the dislodged rats to move away we know that one of the principal fears today of the harlem mother is that her child will be bitten by rats during the night in the new freeman stated the present housing conditions of the vast majority of colored families in new york can only be characterized as disgraceful mr osofsky thus underlines that the problems are not new we are also aware that these conditions could not exist in america if authority and the power structure did not either condone or ignore them osofsky helps enforce this point by describing how policemen literally got rich in the viceridden negro section of new york policemen preferred to work there it was said to get their share of underworld graft a means of reprimanding a disobedient officer was to move his beat from the vice areas he quotes lest it be thought only the rank and file were involved he goes on anyone who was captain of the district the negro section a year could live on tenderloin steaks the rest of his life in his comprehensive research osofsky even investigated negro blues and folk songs of the era involved one of which contains perhaps the most meaningful statement of thingsthen and now it goes now i started at the bottom and i stays there dont seem like im gonna get nowhere in those days it was called the blues today that feeling is called poverty mentality whatever it is called doesnt obscure the fact that it is unnecessary unchristian undemocratic and unamerican perhaps if men like osofsky repeat the message often enough and loud enough then the blues song times gonna bring about a change will become a realitybrooks johnson africa before they came william morrow company by galbraith welch is very like prospecting for gold in sierra madre its arduous dry and uphill but the reader is rewarded often enough with nuggests of semiprecious information about some of africas golden ages that he keeps on another incentive is the wit and humor that is often woven into the fabric of the book and on occasions it is spiced with rather interestingly risque overtones this is not to convey the notion that this is a sexy book but to the extent that the author liberally goes into the personal lives of some of our great heroes and heroines like solomon and sheba the book does cover interesting sex angles but further the author is quite eager to point out the role that the weaker sex has played in the colorful african epoch this is to cover areas where the sexual prejudices of other historians prevented them from giv ing women their fair credit in african history while she makes a pointed effort to overcome some of the basic prejudices of her male counterparts in their treatment or rather nontreatment of women she heiself falls drey to one of the historians oldest prejudices that is she appears to be prone to go into great detail about the glamor glory and marvels of africa of the sahara but africa south of the sahara is usually relegated to a few paragraphs at the end of a chapter when topics common to the two africas were discussed there are several possible reasons for this treatment other than prejudice of course its probably true that information comes easier from africa of the sahara because in so many ways it is intellectually and physically more accessible but before a book such as the one mrs welch attempts to write can really reach its potential these handicaps must be objectively and effectively overcomebrooks johnson no time for tears johnson publishing company is both frightening and inspirational frightening because it relates a series of tragedies befalling one woman any one of which could have been crippling and which combined should have been fatal it is horrifying to think that one woman katheryn patterson experienced a broken home chronic illness culminating in epilepsy was a school dropout and when she seemed almost to have surmounted these obstacles and within sight of happiness a son was born to her who was hydrocephalic such pressures would seem enough to crush the hardiest but the resiliency of the human spirit is a truly amazing phenomenon and nowhere is it better displayed than in the case of mrs patterson the purpose of tragedy can be one of inspiration after reading her story one is likely to wonder is there really any justice in life the answer is provided by the fact that her family recovered from its misfortune and without maudlin selfpity found enough courage to lead as normal a life as circumstances would allow there is something inspirational and fulfilling about the manner in which delbert patterson her husband had the compassion understanding and fortitude to give her the necessities for overcoming her own individual problems and it is moving to learn how she in turn was able to pass these precious gifts on to her afflicted son the book eschews sympathysob prose and is told in a matter of fact fashion allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions it is fast reading simply told and worth the telling from time to time we are all prone to feel life has singled us out for a particularly nasty blow perhaps a book like this could serve as a point of reference to set the record straight againbrooks johnson in the foreward to his autobiography go up for glory coward mccann bill russell says i have fought in every way i know how i fought because i believed it was right to fight i think that no man should fear the consequences because every man must do that which he believes is right with a bit of hip literary drama so do a slow dissolve baby as they say in the movies into black russell takes you all the way back to monroe louisiana where he was born in where the black begins where he first discovered he had to fight the road stretches from the childhood in monroe and then oakland california the high school where most of the teachers were a negative influence on the negro students to the university of san francisco where he spearheaded two national championship teams to the olympics where he saw politics in action and on to the boston celtics and the loneliest life in the world bill russell maintains that he is a basketball player by accident and he calls his profession a childs game the accident perhaps is that he grew much taller than most men and worked hard to develop the skills that enable him to make large sums of money for playing the childs game but bill russell approaches neither basketball nor life as a child his story naturally revolves around the world of professional basketball but his observations of the american scene from the special vantage point of superstarone of our bona fide needsshould interest those who do not know a jump shot from a rebound basketball fans will find russells nba insights fascinating but as the bearded rebel promises this is not the friendship diary of a typical american athlete who makes good there is much causticity in his comments on how the negro views the police the march on washington the compromising that has him disenchanted with the civil_rights movement and an array of other things that have nothing to do with locker rooms and jockey straps russells concern with manhood permeates the book fame so often the great distorter seems to have given bill russell a most implacable sense of priorities he calls success relative and is adamant in maintaining that life to him is something more than a popularity contest the book concludes in reading massachusettswhere he raises his family with russell questioning that his children should be called niggers and hoping that his and his countrymens children might be spared the battles he has had to fight but russell with an amazing ability to dismiss the superficial and reduce the fantasy to truth has indeed grown more than most men in more ways than one it is perhaps an accident that at he has written an autobiography but some accidents are worth happeningd llorens hilip sterlings laughing on the outside the intelligent white readers guide to negro tales and humor grosset dunlap is a collection which both white and negro readers will smile and laugh over in his introduction saunders redding says that the humor of the negro is rooted in social oppression and the book covers the period from ole massa and the plantation to mr charlie and the civil_rights movement although the book is short it is not one to read straight through but to dip into and browse in one may have heard some of the jokes before or read others in collections like hughes and bontemps the book of negro folklore but here they are printed without the broken dialect spelling and are easier to read while they retain their conversational negro tone there are many tales which speakers could use to make a point as lincoln and khrushchev used to do a young minister trying to make a good impression bounded into the pulpit and began to preach at the top of his voice the congregation didnt respond and his voice got weaker and weaker and he finally eased himself from the pulpit and said to the elder i dont think they liked my sermon the elder said if youd gone up like you came down you could have come down like you went up the last section of the book contains the written word by george schuyler web du bois harry golden alice childress ossie davis carl rowan langston hughes sterling brown and dick gregory petroleum v nasby describes how ole massa reacted to emancipation and st clair mckelway how mr and mrs charlie felt about their servants getting defense jobs cartoons by ollie harrington are interspersed through the book and his expressive drawing and robust humor demonstrate that he is one of the best american cartoonists a detailed table of contents and a long bibliography serve the readers convenience dudley randall opinions of the late malcolm_x were mostly formed from the knowledge available through mainstream news media and the relatively few occasions when malcolm appeared on the popular television panel shows the mainstream news media is a poor source for discovering truth and not even malcolm was cunning enough to outmanipulate the boys down at wkkktv or what have you hence very few of us understood the man or his mission as brother malcolm if i may liked to point out you catch hell because youre a black man and he was never really at home never fully at ease or at peace with himself except when standing before his people doing what he did besttelling them why they were catching hell and exactly who was giving them hell malcolm was an orator and the tv panels were not his shot a little publicized book malcolm_x speaks merit publishers provides a belated but much needed opportunity to understand the man moreover this selection of speeches and statements most of them taped during the final year of his life illuminates the dramatic sequel of events that led to his tragic death a sequel of events that remain to the public somewhat mysteriousquite like his death itself trial by jury notwithstanding through his words brother malcolm emerges as one obsessed by honesty unusual phenomenon determined to tell a little more truth about this country and this world each time he opened his handsome mouth he made no false claims in march he humbly stated i am not educated nor am i an expert in any particular fieldbut i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials in an age of experts malcolm was a humanitarian who believed in people i for one spoke malcolm in december believe that if you give people a thorough understanding of what it is that confronts them and the basic causes that produce it theyll create their own program and when the people create a program you get action and malcolms mission was to bring about that action he spent his last year trying to give black americans an understanding of what confronts them and trying to impress them with the necessity of identifying not merely with civil_rights but with human rights malcolm knew that so long as his people refused to look beyond this nations borders so long as they were unable to relate to peoples struggling for freedom the world over there would be no vision though he said i am not educated indeed malcolm learned a great deal about the worlds economy and malcolm possessed rare vision it was in the audubon ballroom two months before he would meet his fate there that he spoke of america and europe controlling the worlds economy so as to keep other nations living at a low standard in plain language he told why america and europe have kept the nations of latin america africa and asia from becoming industrial powers these people are beginning to see said malcolm with reference to the poor nations as barbara ward has called them so when you hear them talking about freedom theyre not talking about a cup of coffee with a cracker no theyre talking about getting into a position to feed themselves and clothe themselves this is the way you and i have to understand the world revolution thats taking place right now in essence brother malcolm spent the last year of his life becoming a dangerous man black men are expected to protest against the system as malcolm had done earlier to be sure but black men are not expected to start messing with the system this book of speeches reveals that malcolm was messing with this mans as malcolm liked to call him system and this fact must be known if one is to understand what malcolm represented at the time of his death unlike the handful of black intellectuals with similar vision malcolm during his final year was discovering ways to communicate his vision to the black masses and he was terribly impatient when you and i are inside of america and look at america said malcolm in december she looks big and bad and invincible oh yes and when we approach her in that context we approach her as beggars with our hat in our hands if we understand whats going on in the world today and fit america into that context we find out that shes not so bad after all shes not very invincible they called him violent but like most revolutionaries brother malcolm was romantic and magnificently human when he spoke of the people his speech was marked with warmth and sensitivity and his admiration for those who battled for the peoplewhether in america africa china or whereverwas manifold to the end malcolm found honest alternatives to our constant lies and booming silence even though he probably knew it would lead to an earlv death malcolm_x speaks is a candid look at one who dared think in a nation that dared him to think black people once believed he was something horrible as white people promulged but if a black man reads this book and dares to think the only horror hell experience is the realization that the man we so desperately needed is no longer with usdavid llorens willard motleys posthumous novel let noon be fair putnams prompts the question asked by arna bontemps in anger and beyond in his discussion of jean toomers disappearance as a negro writer he says the behavior pattern known sociologically as passing for white then has its literary equivalent and the question it raises is whether or not this is proper in the arts like mr motlevs other novels this is not a book about negroes it is about white americans in mexico and their interaction with the mexicans yet although he does not write about negroes mr motley has the observant eye of the everpresent but invisible negro who sees the whites in their unguarded moments there is a sole negro character who is mentioned in only two or three sentences but there we feel motleys negro sensitivity to prejudice he tells how a selfappointed american official complained at the american embassy that one of his compatriots was a communist because she was seen talking to the negro the answer to mr bontemps question is that although mr motley writes of whites he has not copped out he sees them in their perversions drunkenness vulgarity idealism and lavishness with the objective ironical eye of a negro the mexican locale and characters raise a second question the question whether a writer from one culture can write convincingly of another in this mr motley seems to have succeeded i do not know mexico but the world of this novel is a coherent world mr motley writes of many characters but he does not stay long with any his method is panoramiche treats a character in a paragraph a page or several pages and then passes on to another character he is like a man setting tiles who seems to pick up the different colored pieces at random but who gradually forms a pattern we see the characters grow older have children die and we see their children mature the town of las casas grows from eight streets where almost everyone is poor but no one is hungry to a thriving resort where wealthy mexicans and americans vacation and children and professionals beg in the streets the mexicans leave their trades as fishermen and farmers and become cooks and waiters they learn the sexual deviations of the americans they learn to cheat them and to steal from them mr motley does not go inside the minds of his characters there is no psychologizing no symbolism but we get to know the characters as we learn to know our friends by their words and actions their words and actions are significant and so absorb us that it is hard to put the book down until it is finisheddudley randall the savage state by george conchon holt rinehardt winston is a translation of a book concerning life in a new african republic formerly under french rule the author is a former french secretary general of the central african republic it is suggested that because of his position he was able to see racism become a political issue a suggestion that implied racism became an issue after independence the fact of the matter is of course that racism had been an issue in africa before the white man and certainly remained a crucial and a basic political issue during his dominance and after it in a rather cumbersome fashion the story concerns a french couple first separated when the young wife runs away with another frenchman to africa where she leaves the second man in her life to live with an african minister of the new republic this tale is unfolded in a heavy manner which fails because the author forgot the old literary adage that which is worth saying is best stated in simple direct terms when he works with the attitudes and mannerisms of the ministers in their official surroundings the book lightens considerably this is also true of his descriptions of the heat and the scenery but leaving this for the characters the book generally loses plausibility in fairness to the author it should be stated that several of his characters are interesting but even they are sometimes difficult to believe a possible salvaging aspect of the book is the authors interesting dealing with the white masculine egos reaction to the choice of a white woman of a negro when there were attractive white men available disregarding the fact that the african is the second man the wife has been involved with since leaving her husband a young french officer in the republic to shape up the army tells the husband do something for gods sake show yourself worthy to be called a man get a move on this advice being ignored the officer says to a friend take him to bed and tuck him in hes a pansy this fellow beyond revealing how white men feel about their woman sleeping with negro men something negro men have known for some time the book at best is only relatively interesting this is unfortunate because the authors experiences prepared him for a much better effortbrooks johnson the street lights were turned off and the taxi carrying me from the airport crept cautiously through an abyss of candlelight and darkness people loomed like phantoms in the night and now and then came glimpses of the citya broken sidewalk a thatchedroof hut a shirtless cripple sitting on the ground a putrid smell permeated the alleys and now and then the wail of a beggar donnezmoi donnezmoi it was against this setting in the midst of this hell that i first viewed the presidents palace floodlit extravagant it sat mockingly in its little squarea defiant monument to greed cruelty and meglomania there are places in this world that transcend spatial limits and approach the realm of dream tibet they say is one of these as well as certain regions of the himalayas yet another though for social rather than physical reasons is the caribbean republic of haiti it is here in the dictator state of president francois duvallier that graham greene has set his latest novel the comedians viking and it is a case for a while anyway of fiction being just as strange as truth through much of the book haiti soars beyond the conscious is a kind of modernway inferno of wooden huts an occasional candle over a little group bowed over their rum like mourners over a coffin but the altitude once set is not maintained the comedians for all its promise of allegory inevitably bogs down in the shallows of politics sociology and bible morality the protagonist is a man named brown who is returning to his adopted country after failing to sell his resort hotel near portauprince on the boat back he meets jones a sort of international gay blade looking for adventure and the smiths a naive american couple who plan to establish of all things a haitian vegetarian mission vegetarianism isnt only a question of diet mr brown if we really eliminate acidity from the human body we would eliminate passion each is examined in his relation to haitis police state needless to say the americans are quickly disposed of at the first assault on their jeffersonian sensibilities they flee in despair to the dominican republic jones surprisingly acquires a sense of purpose and joins the resistance movement but brown although exposed for the first time to a clearcut moral issue cannot regain the faith he lost at a monte carlo seminary a political as well as a religious cynic he discovers too late that the world for all its senselessness is after all real the conclusion is of course true yet the truth of a major novelist one feels should run a bit deeper the comedians indeed in its unfulfilled promises reads like a blueprinted masterpiece that went astray and greene one of the best of the moderns typifies the general poverty of midth century literature at one point for example protagonist brown finds himself face to face with one concasseur a captain in duvalliers notorious secret police the tontons macoute this monster this mindless assassin of women and children betrays for a fleeting moment just the briefest glimmer of compassion and brown reflects i could understand whv these men wore dark glassesthey were human a true psychologist a dostoievsky say would have just begun his probebeyond freud beyond christ into the unresolved regions of the human personality but greene balks at the challenge concasseur emerges as a shallow onedimensional villain who simply hates revolutionaries for all the modesty of his concept however greene demonstrates once again his special qualifications like a true heavyweight he operates easily in the realm of myth with duvallier appropriately likened to baron samedi a voodoo demigod and a saturday night visitor to haitian graveyards a grotesque figure in a ballet stepping it lightly in his top hat and tails on the sheer plane of journalism moreover the book while not totally free of that irritating and really needless specialness western writers apply to negroes is a largely objective representation of haiti at least as this reviewer experienced it last summer it is also a tribute to the haitian people one of the most civilized in all latin america in their persistent resistance to a mad tryant hamilton bims a the two worlds of somerset maugham by wilson menard sherbourne press is one of the most rewarding reading surprises this reviewer has come across in some time the book jacket has a rather impressively haughty painting of mr maugham on the front the great author is literally looking down his hawklike nose with his hands and legs folded in an almost too precise manner sitting on what appears to be a rattan stool the whole image projects a kind of grand majestic quality calculated to make the reader wonder if he could not better spend his time reading something else the thematic impressions suggested by the painting are skillfully captured and developed by the author mr menard the impression given by maugham staring from the painting is that he is a prig and a snob the fact that mr maugham was something of a snob is beyond question but this snobbery is skillfully shown by mr menard to be based not on race or station but on whether or not he found the person interesting his contact with the natives of the pacific his understanding and appreciation of their mores and sex standards substantiates the fact that though he had little time for those who bored him he was most patiently understanding and appreciative of those whom he thought manifested honesty and character a theme suggested by the rattan stool is that maugham was comfortable in the south pacific atmosphere and further that he got some support from this nothing could be more true as some of his most famous and rewarding tales came from that part of the world where he understood what was going on and where he felt comfortable in the setting there was something sensual about the south pacific of that time and maugham was sensual in his appetites although it appeared he was in some manner above or beyond sex it is amply clear that he was the recipient of some sort of vicarious sensuality from mr menards repititions of conversations he had with maugham about the islands since the topic recurring with the most regularity is sex and the manner and means in which it was practiced and enjoyed by the people of the south seas the reader is often on the point of asking himself was mr maugham in fact a homosexual there is something in the painting to suggest this and indeed obituaries have suggested as well that he had a certain ambivalence in this respect the delicate manner in which the hands rest in the painting is one clue and there are other points which cause one to wonder but the reader soon realizes that this is a minor theme at best and becomes deeply involved in this extremely interesting book about an extremely interesting man mr menard deserves to take a deep bow for the job he did in making this book exceptionally readable aided though he was by his genuine interest and liking for his subject matter as well as the fact that he and mr maugham had a great deal in common but without his considerable talents as a writer traveler and researcher the book would never have come off as well as it has perhaps the best way to sum it up is to say that this is not a book done to capitalize on the morbid appetites which develop after the death of a famous person this is a book done by a man skilled in his craft dedicated to his subject and greatly endowed with both sensitivity and talentbrooks johnson the white kid on the floor next to me bore the brunt of the violence that was going on in our area near the lunch counter i was sorry as hell for him on one hand but guiltily glad it was him instead of me on the other the next day i was too ashamed to look him in the face and a sort of coolness grew between us based upon nothing but the fact that i somehow felt he had gotten a beating that should have been intended for me since that experience i have often wondered what white civil_rights workers feel and think as they take to the picket lines lunch counters and such sally belfrages freedom summer viking press comes about as close as i have been able to get in coming up with some meaningful answers freedom summer is more than just a revelation of some of the feelings and thoughts of a white civil_rights worker it is a sensitive interesting perceptive piece of work the author is a very gifted writer and observer she is both a young impressionable girl full of good intentions and deeds and at the same time she is a realist that nothing of note escapes the combination is very fruitful as it is displayed in her book freedom summer offers the reader a welcomed escape from the usual well intentioned but lacking works that have been cranked out on this subjectbrooks johnson political science political theory philosophy and even physics for that matter all deal with the same topics if one gets deep enough into the subjects ultimately there must be some a priori determination about the nature of the universe and mans relationship to and position in the universe in the case of philosophy and social sciences there must be a determination about the real nature of man himself from this determination comes a logical progression of assumptions and notions about men that culminates in what we now call liberal or conservative political views neil staebler and douglas ross have compiled a book how to argue with a conservative grossman publishers inc to give you ammunition to defend liberal and demolish conservative arguments there is a certain pitfall in the book itself because it does such a good job of demonstrating how to argue with a conservative it might be assumed that the arguments presented in the book are the answer to conservatism but the hard truth of the matter is that the book does an excellent job of getting at the symptoms of conservatism but the causes are really couched in the conservatives basic concept of man for the liberals the logical progression starts with the notion that man is basically good and has altruistic ethical judicious forces within him and it is circumstances usually that make him anything other than a good person for the conservative man is basically bad and it takes discipline learning determination and courage to change himself into something desirable this is perhaps a gross oversimplification of the points of views but essentially it is pertinently correct mr ross and mr staebler have done an excellent job of selecting out some of the more troublesome points of the conservative and providing us with adequate answers but the real problem in changing a conservative is not to thwart his arguments but to change his thinking about men basically i suppose that if a person were exposed to the devastating dialogue of this book he might want to make certain reappraisals about things but im not certain that he would be that moved to make the basic alterations in his conception of men to make him liberal but in all fairness to the book it does what it sets out to do what is now needed is not a criticism of this book but the production of a book that is convincing enough to alter the basic thinking about the true nature of man there can be no real permanent improvement unless man is seen in more positive light by men but the fact that this problem has been articulated and argued in the works of the early thinkers and philosophers right down to today convincingly attests to the resiliency of the problem and the elusiveness of acceptable permanent answers perhaps there are none but the mere glimmer of hope that there may be one is reason enough to goad men on further and further in the search for answersbrooks johnson when t s eliot wrote some of the essays in to criticize the critic farrar straus giroux he was a controversial avantgrade poet now with the collection and publication of these essays after his death he is a venerable member of the establishment with rebellion flaring among the beatniks the black mountain school and the new york school what helped him get into the establishment besides his composing very good poetry was his authoritative criticism which helped to explain his kind of verse his critical essays not only afforded understanding of the poets whom he discussed but gave insights into the writing of poetry he was able to embody these insights in memorable phrases like dissociation of sensibility and objective correlative which served as touchstones to a particular style some of the same insights into literature and language occur in this book and i cannot do better than to quote a few of them which incidentally answer some of his younger criticson a separate american language advocated by william carlos williams but i was puzzled by the subtitle it is called a dictionary of the american language perhaps i am unconsciously bilingual so that whichever language i hear or read seems to me my own but certainly the vast majority of the words in this dictionary are words belonging to both america and england and having the same meaning in both and the definitions seemed to me to be written in english too the following quotation could apply to the beatniks to insist on the allimportance of subjectmatter to insist that the poet should be spontaneous and irreflective that he should depend upon inspiration and neglect technique would be a lapse from what is in any case a highly civilized attitude to a barbarous one eliots reflections on vers libre published in are just as valid today with todays attacks on the iambic pentameter he says but the most interesting verse which has yet been written in our language has been done either by taking a very simple form like the iambic pentameter and constantly withdrawing from it or taking no form at all and constantly approximating to a very simple one freedom is only freedom when it appears against the background of an artificial limitation the division between conservative verse and vers libre does not exist for there is only good verse bad verse and chaosdudley randall i as a new kid in town had to go through my share of fights and squabbles to prove that i was not to be messed with but there was another kid who never seemed to be able to prove that he was not to be messed with i accidentally found out one day that his father owned the jewstore and somehow in my eight year old brain i connected his fathers occupation with the burden the kid had to bear one day i was about to fight with a kid bigger and older because he deliberately threw my ball down a long hill i didnt relish the encounter because i wasnt sure of the outcome but he had done it without any cause and had to take him on or lose face in front of the others just as i was about to get it on a voice rang out ill get it and down the hill ran this jew kid he came back up triumphantly with the ball he was winded but said to the bully the next time you do that im gonna kick your ass i wasnt too sure i wanted someone fighting my battles for me but i was somehow certain that this kid wasnt just taking up for me a strange affinity grew up between us and we became close friends we both became known as capable guys with our fists but when it got around that we had formed a sort of mutual protection pact we were left to do pretty much as we pleased i knew that because my friend was jew and i a negro we shared something in common that separated us from the white kids yet it gave us a special understanding and appreciation of each other rabbi abraham l feinbergs storm the gates of jericho marzani munsell provides the reader with a special insight into jewry but more than that it does so in an interesting and moving literary style the special result of reading the book is the fact that people of open minds and goodwill are enabled to better understand and appreciate rabbi feinberg in particular and something of jewry in generalgreat books bring something new to the world in one form or another good books usually bring refreshing style restatement of established ideas clarification about existing things or better insights rabbi feinbergs book is a good book he brings new clarity and understanding in what might be termed an autobiography but the understanding takes manv different forms much of it is scathing criticism of the hypocrisy foolishness and supercilious things to which the world spends precious time and effort paying homage but despite the fact that feinberg states that jews are just people we must also keep in mind another fact moses jesus marx freud and einstein all were jews if a people who represent just one half of one percent of the worlds population can produce men of this caliber then the rest of us have some lessons to learn from them and thats the real value of the book it provides us with lessons that would benefit us all to learn and applybrooks johnson in the interactions between the white man and the black man there is one fact that emerges with clarity and impactthe black man knows his white counterpart infinitely better than the white man knows his colored brother white men it appears go to africa for myriad kinds of reasons but despite this variety of motive we see something of a uniformity in the kind of reactions and thinking they express about africa this is because they are relatively consistent in their lack of understanding of the black man and thus anything they might later think or articulate is shaped and warped by this ignorance sean grahams a surfeit of sun doubleday is another example of the post african independence novel we see coming from intelligent gifted writers who have spent time in africa and are now chronicling africas problems after independence there is a formula that is discernible in these books we have interracial involvement between the major characters combining with race prejudice from both sides mixed liberally with the inefficiency of the local african government to produce circumstances that cause the natives to revert to savagery it is certainly true that these elements do exist and can and do combine to create rather undesirable situations but a rather constant flow of this kind of story certainly distorts the picture and the last thing that africa needs is more distortion but further and even more distasteful is the fact that the books leave the reader with the feeling that the reasons for the chaos is because black men are now in the drivers seat the truth of the matter is that we have problems in africa because we have unskilled untrained sometimes greedy men in power who happen to be black white airconditioned ibm thinking is applied in a tropical setting where the greatest need is perhaps antibiotics and education and this thinking comes up with the conclusion that what is necessary is more colonialism surfeit is defined as meaning excess superfluity overabundant supply with mr grahams book i think a surfeit has been reached in this kind of bookbrooks johnson at the eastwest v p allstar game seven of the ten starters were hoards neg ro a former nba player once an allstar himself walked out of the arena shortly after the game began i was disgusted he said later there were just too many of them i couldnt get interested in watching them play on november st louis started three negroes against philadelphia which started four by the second period all ten players on the court were negro nobody wants to say anything but of course the owners are worried how are you going to draw with colored players on your teaman nba coach oscar robertson sat on his bed in a new york hotel room one day several weeks ago sure he was saying to someone you cant overlook the situation dont know if what wilt said was true but people cant say its not true it could be true the owners and the players know it could be true what wilt had said in a wabc radio interview with howard cosell was that the growth of the nba had been held back by the preponderance of negro stars in the nba wilt said it calmly and with the reservation i think a theory a theory which if correct suggests something about the sports fans of this nation was wilt correct did the men who run the nba agree and if so were they reacting with regard for high principles or their pocketbooks i put the questions to nba general managers coaches and players their answers varied i will get to them in a moment but there was agreement on this in an astonishingly short time negro players have come to dominate the league in there were only six negroes among the leagues players of these only one maurice stokes was an allstar early this season of playing jobs in the national basketball association were held by negroes of these were normally starters and of that were allstars in other words almost half the nba players were negro twothirds of the starters were negro and nearly three of every four allstars were negro and there are more coming the next wave of superstars is percent negro cazzie russell of michigan is todays top college senior mel daniels of new mexico is the top junior westley unseld of louisville is the top sophomore lew alcindor of ucla is the top freshman how to explain this flood of negro talent they have a natural talent for basketball one exnba player told me basketball is a rhythm game and negroes have that natural rhythm the rhythm theory got whoops from negro players heck said one for every negro with natural moves there are ten who can hardly run without tripping but you get to see only the one guy with natural ability we make it by work work work said oscar robertson another negro star told me we know we can t settle for being as good as a white player like in everything else we got to be betterlots betteror were not going to get the job they say negroes naturally jump higher than whites the negro jumps higher because he knows if he doesnt its back to the ghetto several nba people cited gus johnson as an example of the negro athletes tremendous drive to succeed jerry lucas has more natural ability than gus said one player but gus will outplay him more often than not gus grew up playing ball on the streets of akron ohio and all he heard about was that lucas kid at middletown and how great he was jerry went to ohio state and all of ohio raved about him gus had to go to idaho now when he plays against jerry gus eats him alive and jerry doesnt do much against gus you can see gus out there and i know hes thinking i had nothing in my life never had and this big white kid had everything ill show him ill show him most negroes grew up with a basketball court around the corner in the slums says walter kennedy commissioner of the nba there is no room for little league baseball or junior football but you can play basketball wherever you put up a hoop and it costs nothing a kid goes to a schoolyard checks out a basketball and he can play all day summer and winter another thing when i was a boy i wanted to be like babe ruth just as negro kids my age wanted to be joe louis in the last decade negro kids can imagine themselves being wilt or oscar with boxing on the decline negro kids have new idols to pattern themselves after and as a result you get more negro stars in baseball and basketball certainly the number of negroes is increasing in all sports but in basketball the players wear the briefest uniforms no face masks no head covering either and the fans are closest to the court willie mays races back for a fly ball and his glove darts up out of a blur of white or grey uniform jim brown assaults a line and a bright orange helmet spearheads a swiftmoving missile of dark shirt and white pants bill russell reaches for a rebound and black skin sparkles when boston starts k c jones sam jones bill russell tom sanders and willie naullsas red auerbach has doneone need not be a racist to note that all five are negro when the st louis hawks warm up one sees men clustered in the small area of halfcourt and needs no adding machine to count that seven are negro one sees the philadelphia ers come out for a tapoff and need have no eagle eye to ascertain that five of the six players on the bench are white chamberlain believes this preponderance of negro talent will hold back the leagues growth and he explained why to howard cosell people for some reason tend to pull for things somewhat similar or like themselves and so when they come out they want to root for something thats similar something they can see themselves in this is not always true of course there are little white boys who pick up a bat and say im willie mays but by and large as chamberlain said people root for something thats similar something they can see themselves in they do it he said for some reason the reason we suggest is race prejudice subtle prejudice unconscious prejudice very often but it is there and the fear of nba owners the question that worries them is in a society that is percent white is this prejudicethis ability of some white spectators to identify with negro athletesdeep enough and widespread enough to hold back nba growth to be specific will it keep attendance on a permanent plateau dim interest of tv sponsors prevent the spread of franchises to the south let us examine each question will it hold down attendance our figures simply do not back up wilts claim that our attendance is stagnating says haskell cohen nba publicity director attendance last year was percent up from the year before during the past five years our attendance on the average has increased by ten per cent each year this year says commissioner kennedy attendance in the first month was up more than per cent over the comparable period last season i would say definitely that attendance this season will exceed the per cent gain we made last season when a team wins says cohen it draws when it loses attendance falls off its as simple as that ill give you a good example says kennedy san francisco when we went in there pro basketball was unknown and attendance was awful but in the team won the western title and attendance went way up in the team finished with the worst wonlost record in nba history and attendance dropped almost to where it had started in that period the ratio of negro to white players on the team didnt change much this proves i would think that the boxoffice record of a team is tied directly to the wonlost record of a team a number of negro players agreed with kennedy look at the dodgers in baseball said st louis lenny wilkens sometimes they had five or six negroes on the field and they drew two million they drew because they won overall nba attendance has jumped per cent since equalling the growth rate of pro football and far outpacing baseballs minuscule five per cent it is true that nba attendance is less than half the attendance of the national football league though each nba team plays games and each nfl team only but a per cent annual growth rate even allowing for some exaggeration in the counting is hardly stagnation where wilt is on firmer ground is when he points a finger toward boston the celtics are the pride of the league winner of seven straight championships as winners in they averaged in attendance as winners four years later they averaged the boston arena holds chamberlain did not say this but his point is implicit when he discusses celtic attendance when whites like bob cousy and bill sharman starred with russell attendance was on the rise when the jones boys replaced the two white stars attendance crept up only slightly averaging out to less than per cent a year in an affluent city with a championship ballclub the best of all timethis might well be called stagnation why should a team with a record compiled such as it boston has wilt said to cosell not draw to capacity crowds whereas the hockey team fills the house almost every night are you saying to me said cosell that one of the reasons that hockey plays to per cent attendance capacity is because it is all white i definitely believe that said wilt hockey draws well in boston answers commissioner kennedy because boston is the seat of american hockey basketball pro or college was never big there until after the war anyway if what wilt says is true then the logical alternative would be that if hockey added negro players attendance would decline i doubt that it would fall off and again the commissioner cites the rise in overall nba attendance but the unanswerable question the question nba owners consider is would league attendance have gone up higher if there were more white stars will the negro dominance dim tv interest the american broadcasting company paid the american football league million to telecast football games in the fall of the same network paid the nba to telecast basketball games in in broadcasting circles it was said that the reason for the disparity in prices was the lack of a white nba star that question never came up in our negotiations with abc says kennedy and believe me a lot of questions came up the reason for the difference in prices says nba officials is that nba teams have local tv contracts which afl teams do not have these local telecasts make nba games less attractive to the networks thus the lower network bid abctv says it has been happily surprised by the ratings for nba games last season the ratings were averaging per cent of tunedin sets which was slightly higher than the ratings for afl football games however the afl games had to compete against nfl telecasts but there is no sign of any frenzied bidding as there is for pro football among the tv networks for nba games im only being realistic one broadcasting man told me when i say that if a white center were to come along to challenge chamberlain or russell the ratings for those games would jump at least fifty per cent will the negro dominance limit the spread of new franchises into the south of present franchises only baltimore and st louis could be considered southern cities st louis attendance is soso baltimores poor but neither have titlecontending teams the baltimore situation is interesting baltimore has a high negro population and the teams two stars for a long timegus johnson and walt bellamyare negro yet the percentage of negro attendance is far below the percentage of negroes in the city this has raised another disturbing question for the nba if an nba team were to be allnegro would it not only alienate some whites but also fail to drawfor economic or whatever reasonsthe citys negro fans not so said several negro players a team with a lot of negroes will draw white and negro fansif it wins said one baltimore doesnt draw negroes because it loses a negro fan is like a white fanhe wants his moneys worth of some odd applications for new nba franchises two have come from the deep southatlanta and new orleans one indication that such franchises could succeed came this winter st louis with seven negroes on the squad scheduled eight games in memphis tennessee in their first memphis game the hawks drew a hefty an nba club would go over in the south with per cent negro players said one white southern player but the team would have to be a winner the fact then is that negro players have come to dominate the nba and economic questions have arisen as a result the fact too is that important nba men have been thinking about these economic questions their thought has spurred some action and some criticism for starters this seems certain the negro fringe player has been badly hurt up to or so says a man close to the nba you kept a colored player as your ninth or tenth man you had to pay him only or so a lot less than you had to pay a white boy but not any more now the tenth and th players are white boys to balance off the squad today you replace white with white colored with colored as your white bench men slow down you draft whites to replace them when your colored starters slow down you draft negroes because it is a lot easier to get a fast strong negro forward than a white one if you have to go with a white forward against a negro forward youre in trouble the white boy isnt strong enough fast enough tough enough if youre eighth or ninth man and colored youre dead one negro player told me if an owner has to cut someone he cuts whats a worry for hima negro the racial balancing of teams began as a gentlemans agreement believes willie jones who played for detroit from to willie was a hustling guard and when detroit cut him a baltimore official talked about picking him up what for said someone else hes an eighth or ninth man and hes colored today willie at is in the insurance business in chicago he says he has no bitterness toward the nba he thinks he was cut because he didnt get along with coach charley wolf but he has no illusions either around he says i think the owners said lets keep the number of negroes down to say no more than three but then someone started to carry four and he was winning and he said the hell with the agreement so the others started to carry four then five to catch up and the thing kept buildmg several years ago when the bullets were run by a different management its draft pickers were reportedly told get a forward any forward as long as hes a white forward the bullets drafted gary bradds whod slowed down a step in his senior year at ohio state what really killed me said one man close to the baltimore team is that we could have gotten either willis reed or lucious jackson jackson and reed became league allstars bradds was cut this year commissioner kennedy likes to repeat what the late walter brown owner of the celtics told bill russell several years ago after russell had charged there was a racialquota system in the league said brown to russell i dont care if youre pink white or eskimo youve got a job on this team as long as you can play basketball but kennedy concedes that he has no way of knowing whether all owners share browns sentiments one nba coach tacitly admitted there was a racial quota when he told me you know we cant carry of them there is no quota system on my club says richie guerin coach of the hawks if there were do you think i would have retired mike farmer white and kept jim washington a negro who like farmer is st louis tenth or th man richie is one in a million says a negro on the hawks the rest of the nba is the same as baseball they figured a negro cant play as a regular so they let him go around the league they will tell you that the hawks loaded with negroes are desperate for a white star to replace pettit the hawks wanted billy cunningham who is white real bad in the draft last year says one nba coach the hawks died when philadelphia picked billy ahead of them we play to win answers hawk general manager marty blake thats all we care about another coach said he thought red auerbach was having second thoughts now that he is the general manager about the race situation i notice said the coach he plays ron bonham a lot now and he boosts mel counts both are white we put the best men out there auerbach roars only the best were not interested in politics or race problems im a basketball coach thats all the nba brass may not be interested in politics or race problems per se but since politics and race problems are interwoven here with that motivator in pro sports economicsthere is nba interest and says one negro explayer on the subject of negroes and nba economics suppose oscar and wilt and bill withdrew from the league the nba would be wrecked i think the negro has helped more than hurt the league true but now with one nba team official saying the talent in negro colleges is unbelievable they have guards who dunk and with another man saying that on a talent basis within a few years the league could be percent to percent negro the fear is that has hurt will soon if it has not already replace has helped times have changedfor the betterbut prejudice did not die with the civil_rights act of the nba knows it is facing a problem it cannot morally or legally discriminate one immediate solution to the problem suggested to me by nearly every nba player and coach to whom i talked was expansion i dont see any reason one negro star told me why pro basketball cant support as many clubs as pro baseball or pro football the thinking is that at least percent of these new jobs would be filled by negroes but others would be taken by whites who otherwise would be shut out of the nba the thinking too is that with expansion there could be four divisions giving better balance and more winners and winners usually do well at the box office another solution suggested by one nba team official is more vigorous promotion of the league just as it ispromotion to offset prejudice i hear them moan says one nba team official they say how can i draw with all those negroes i got on this club the trouble with them is they dont know how to promote the greatest game in the world they think all they have to do is throw open the doors expansion and more vigorous promoting these are two solutions the real solution of course must take place inside peoples minds david was happy he was waiting for victoria to ask her a if she answer question and gave him the he expected he would be happier still he had played in the schoolyard all afternoon and when he had enough of play he came up to his den in the attic his den was at the end of the attic near the one small window level with the floor his desk was an old army blanket spread on the floor his bookcase an egg crate containing his books and notebooks the window overlooked the playground which extended from his backyard to the school near the other end of the block he swung it open admitting the freshness of the april afternoon and the voices of the children on the schoolyard davids glance wandered over the field flooded with sunshine a group of boys and a group of girls were playing baseball and smaller children were climbing on the swing supports and the horizontal bars near the alley some older youths were playing dice with one on the lookout for the roaches the bright shirts and dresses the movements of the ball players the crack of bats on balls and the shouts of the players made the field a world of color and motion and sound david projected himself into the scene he was striking the ball running the bases he was crouched in the corner over the dice caressing them and talking to them like a lover while he was immersed in these actions he was aware of another self that stood aloof and watched him doing these things and of yet another self that watched him watching himself like a series of mirrors david did not see victoria on the playground and he began to write in his notebook in the spring of his seventeenth year david first saw her and fell in love with her she was playing with other girls but she was the only one he saw she outhit and outran and outlaughed them all she was tall and lithe and shapely her arms and legs were bare and darkened by the sun to the color of bronze her voice was like the sound of silver that was how he first saw victoria he learned her name from his friends and asked his big sister about her rachel laughed are you carrying a torch for victoria what do you see in her shes boxankled and walleyed she has big eyes and pretty legs david paid no attention to rachel she was laughing at him only because he was interested in a different girl from the ones she was always trying to put off on him and in whom he was never interested rachel told him that victoria was an orphan she lived with her uncle and her aunt who made her do all the housework but let her come and go as she pleased after she had done her work david learned all these things about her before he ever spoke to her one day as he was shambling along the street with his eyes cast down to avoid stumbling on the level pavement he saw a pair of small feet then a pair of brown legs he did not know whose they were but there was something familiar and exciting about them looking up he saw victoria coming toward him there was no one whom he would rather have met yet he began thinking of ways to avoid her he looked about wildly but he had passed the alley and had not reached the cross street he could turn into a doorway or cross to the other side of the street but that would be too obvious he could pass her without speaking but that was rude but if he spoke to her first would she answer him now she was upon him what could he do she smiled and said hello david david grew dizzy and faint and thought he was going to fall on the street he put out his hand as if to clutch at something and stammered hhello after she passed he leaned against a telephone pole until he was able to walk again after that he would speak to her whenever they met he made no attempt to seek her out or to go the places where she might be he was content with occasional chance meetings they made his days rich and adventuresome who could tell when and where he would see her he would speak to her she would smile at him and utter his name always the same thing happened to him the blood rushed to his face his knees grew weak he became dizzy and could hardly speak he would make his way back home giddy and excited and would write an account of the meeting about this time he became acquainted with dantes love poetry in the new life it expressed his emotions perfectly dantes chance meetings with beatrice and his adoration of her were just like his encounters with victoria and his love for her he read him incessantly and learned the new life almost by heart he bought an italian grammar and a book of italian poetry and read dantes love poems in the original things might have gone on like this indefinitely if he had not had a talk with ned adams david liked to go to the settlement house sometimes to work out with the boxers one night ned adams who was the city amateur middleweight champion asked him to go a couple of rounds with him david shook ned twice with rights to the head the champion could have hurt him in retaliation but goodnaturedly refrained he smothered david with left hooks and looping rights to the head but his blows had no more sharpness than the sheathed paws of a playful kitten when they were dressing ned looked him up and down and said youre built like a fighter you have a punch like a mule and are fast as hell why dont you train regular in two years we could make a champion out of you a lightweight on the next bench laughed hes too busy chasing tail david said hotly i cant be bothered with girls they get in my hair ned looked at him skeptically he was older than david about twenty maybe you dont have the right line girls like to be courted you cant stand off and expect them to come to you you have to go to them i know that girls cant talk sense like you can talk to another guy you have to give them a lot of bull tell em theyre pretty and crap like that theyll eat it up and theres another thing you have to play each one different im fooling around with a little fox thats trying to play hard to get ive been giving her the absent line i havent been around for two or three weeks when i do show up shell be ready to fall into my lap victoria is not like that david thought nevertheless neds words made him think of getting better acquainted with her so far he had been content to admire her from a distance this feeling had come on him so suddenly that he had not had time to adjust to it he was not sure what he would do but he vaguely imagined that some time in the future victoria would be his girl now he began to think of some practical means of winning her he made up his mind that the next time he met her instead of merely saying hello he would stop and talk with her and learn to know her better the very next day when he walked into mr siegels drugstore he saw her standing by the counter he was totally unprepared for the meeting at least when he met her on the street he had some seconds of preparation before speaking to her now he was totally surprised he could hardly stand so he dropped upon a stool at the soda fountain victoria smiled at him thinking of things to say he forgot to say anything mr siegel said whatll it be david mechanically he blurted out ill take a soda then suddenly to victoria wont you have one with me no thanks i just had one his heart sank she hesitated but i wouldnt mind another one she sat down by his side they began to talk of school and of neighborhood events david had often dreamed of some day talking to wise men and poets but even in his imagination those conversations were not so exciting as this one with victoria she was easy to talk with and gradually david became outwardly calm but all the while the air seemed shaking with some tremendous music of organ or full orchestra to which his heart blood and pulse danced riotously he never knew what they said but he noticed how long black and curly her hair was and how it poured upon her shoulders her eyebrows were straight and thick the lashes long and glossy her eyes were large and soft her nose delicately chiselled her skin was coppercolored and her cheek suffused with red had the gentle curves of a childs after she finished her soda she stood up and said thank you for the soda i enjoyed it as she walked out he noticed the way her waist tapered from her shoulders and breasts he sat with his head on his hands thinking about her at last mr siegel said david does anything hurt you david started up without a word and walked out for the next two days david lived in the memory of those moments then he began to miss victoria he watched for her from the window looked for her in the streets and even walked past her house but he did not see her one day rachel found him sitting moodily in front of the window and said david why are you sitting by the window looking half dead holy pete if you like victoria why dont you go out and get her instead of mooning in front of the window and reading those silly books but what can i do shes never invited me to her house i wouldnt invite you to my house either if i were victoria in the first place why dont you get rid of that sloppy sweatshirt and those baggy pants and change to a shirt and tie and then get some savoirfaire is that what those overdressed dimwits that come to see you are supposed to have at least theyre more polished than you my shabby bookworm but listen to me im trying to help you if you want victoria to be your girl youll have to go out and get her faint heart never won fair lady why dont you invite her to go out with you but where could i take her there are lots of places movies picnics dances i know just the thing my clubs giving a dance next month you can invite her to that for a start ill give you an invitation but how can i take her to a dance you know i cant dance ill teach you you have weeks to learn come on lets get busy right away rachel put a record on the phonograph and began to show david the basic steps after he learned them she had him dance with her dont stand so far away i wont bite you im your sister now relax let yourself go and dont be so wooden and for heavens sake dont look so mad youre not in a gym at the end of his first lesson david had made definite progress he danced every day with rachel and practiced by himself often he was stiff and selfconscious but sometimes he forgot himself in the music and rachel would look at him in surprise and say youre doing fine victoria will enjoy dancing with you her praise would make him conscious again of what he was doing he would look at his feet and think of the steps and then rachel would scold him for making mistakes at the end of a week of daily sessions he thought he had learned enough to invite victoria to go with him to the dance today he was going to invite her he was waiting until she appeared on the playground then he would go outside and speak to her he looked out the window again behind the roofs were pink and orange clouds the level sunlight stretched long shadows across the field reflected from the red bricks of the street the light took on a rosy hue victory was not on the field david reached for his book of italian poetry and began to read one of dantes love sonnets how wonderfully dante described beatrice and the way he felt about her how wonderful that the description fitted his own girl and himself so perfectly the poem seemed to be not dante talking about beatrice but himself speaking of victoria he would translate it he would put it into english so she could read it and at the dance maybe he would show it to her he turned to a blank page in his notebook and began to write my lady carries love within her eyes how true that was about victoria her eyes were soft and warm and contained nothing but kindness the first line of a sonnet was always the easiest now for the second which renders noble all she looks upon how true that line was also for whenever he saw victoria he felt cleaner and finer just as dante had written the divine comedy for beatrice one day he would write a great poem for victoria the second line of a sonnet was generally easy too but the third line was where the rimes and the difficulty began when she goes by men turn and gaze at her that was exactly what happened whenever victoria walked down the street for david was not the only one she attracted when she passed slim and graceful with her long black hair hanging over her shoulders he had seen men turn around and draw in their breath but that line would not fit it did not rime with either of the preceding lines the thought of her walking down the street reminded david that this was about the time she came to the playground he glanced out the window she was there she wore a plain white dress like a nurses which fitted snugly at the waist she was playing catch with another girl two boys stood nearby watching now and then they said something to her and they all laughed she missed the ball and one of the boys turned to retrieve it for her but she raced him to the ball and picked it up herself he grabbed her around the waist but she twisted smoothly away from him that was one of the things david liked about her she did not allow anyone to take liberties with her even when boys tried to do her favors because she was a girl she refused to accept them but kept herself in a position of equality with them her refusal was not the curt i can do anything you can do and better too of some athletic girls but a gracious declining that still left them pleased with themselves and with her she was popular with all the boys and with girls also everything david noticed about her made him like her and since he stumbled on every curb and every flight of stairs was ashamed to look into mirrors and could never think of anything to say he admired her all the more because she was graceful and beautiful and friendly now he would go out and speak to her now he would ask her to go to the dance with him and she would consent he stood up to go but after taking a step he paused suppose she refused what could he say to persuade her until now he had not imagined anything but that she would consent now the thought of failure made cold sweat come on his brow he had better wait a few minutes and think it over perhaps he could think of some winning graceful way to ask her he picked up the book and lay down again to think how clean and fresh she looked in the museum was the torso of a greek girl which he loved the cold white marble seemed to breathe and be soft and warm to the touch victoria reminded him of this torso but with a subtle difference she had not the antique greek lines her shoulders were wider her breasts larger her abdomen flatter and deeper and she could not be expressed in cold white marble she was like a statue of bronze of warm polished bronze with a glaze that gleamed silver in the light above the warm brown metal beneath there was such a glaze on her skin he imagined it to be sleek to his fingers his attention was diverted to the schoolyard by a sudden movement two figures split from the knot of gamblers and walked toward the far end of the yard david recognized them as ned adams and willie george lee ned wore a closefitting white rayon polo shirt blue jeans and moccasins he was stocky and barrelchested but moved easily and lightly willie george was also a boxer a flyweight and a tapdancer as well he danced in the smaller night clubs he was older than ned and one of his cronies he was dapper as a flea in a lavender sport shirt green slacks and brown suede shoes ned and willie george swaggered across the playground boys greeted them and girls turned and looked into their faces but the fighters did not notice them they stopped a few feet from victoria she held the ball in her hand and looked around ned stared straight at her she looked into his eyes she dropped the ball ned picked it up and handed it to her she smiled they began to talk meanwhile willie george accosted the other girl she was a short plump girl named eva whose brother was feebleminded david knew her for one night she came to him and a friend on the schoolyard and asked them to lie down in the doorway of the school with her the boys stared at each other hot flustered my father told me to come home they said in unison and walked away now willie george seized her by the waist and led her through a dance step they laughed and applauded themselves it was growing darker the color of the air deepened from rose to violet one by one or in little groups the boys and girls went home their cries and laughter faded away in the dusk the two couples were alone in the shadows the street lamps came on there was one in the alley near the schoolhouse it cast a silver light over the field but the entrance of the building recessed was deep in shadow ned was still talking to victoria he leaned close to her took her by the hand pulled her toward him she did not resist or draw away as she did with the other boys davids face burned he could imagine vividly her quick smile her large slowmoving eyes her ringing laughter the sweet smell of soap on her body the electric atmosphere about her the impression of delicacy yet strength that her shape conveyed he could also imagine her sensing neds confident grin his powerful chest his deep vibrant voice his pungent sweat they stood close together their bodies touching davids whole body was on fire he would go down there he would join them he would make believe he was passing by and would stop and talk with them but something kept him rooted there like a spectator at a play who identifies himself with the actors and is involved in the action but who can in no way influence it part of himself was victoria and part of himself ned with another self watching himself the actor and a third self watching himself the observer eva squealed willis george was unbuttoning her blouse she shook her head and pulled away he grabbed her arm and dragged her toward the doorway she leaned back resisting and shrieking but her shrieks dissolved in giggles and she let herself be dragged along they disappeared in the shadows now victoria and ned turned they too strolled toward the doorway neds arm was around her waist victorias arm was over neds shoulder david could imagine under victorias fingers the sleekness of the rayon shirt the hardness of neds swelling muscles he could feel under neds fingers the narrowness of her waist the ridges of her ribs and as his hand moved upward the softness of her breast they were on the steps of the building ned pulled victoria closer to him she did not resist they moved together into the shadows david was trembling he hated ned he hated victoria he would fight ned he would punch him to ribbons victoria victoria why have you done this to me why have you betrayed me you are no good you are cheap easy no why blame victoria you are a fool how did you know she liked you what made you think she was yours how can you compete against ned what do you have to offer the book of poetry which he had been clutching slipped from his hand he picked up the book through the window came a peal of laughter from victoria he flung the book down on the blanket with a sob it was black dark now too dark to read drcrawford has a fifty dollar name for my ailment being incapable of using small numbers or symbols other than dollar signs he labels my trouble hysteria realizing psychiatrists thrive upon mysticism and words i insisted a broken water pump caused the entire mess but this mercenary medical guardian employed by my wife prohibits my leaving this place before coming to grips with reality upon explaining my recent misbehavior to the doctor i may merit a furlough so each day by talking into the tape recordercost fifty dollars a weeki hope to convince the doctors of my ability this taped therapy they term orally catalyzed mental catharsis but i recall confession at old st marys was less expensive that is another part of my problem which began quite simply the water pump burst without warning it was embarrassing driving through our quiet suburb with the car rattling like tin cans so i caught the bus the ride brought a return of pleasant childhood memories bus number traversed the old neighborhood where very little had changed music shrieked from a few more taverns and smoke belched from numerous barbque houses but basically objects appeared familiar the trip was invigorating realizing new perspective might be gained i decided to ride the number all week the fiftyfirst street elevated line was a bustling transfer point in this highly segregated city the station became an oasis of integration cosmopolitan life converged at the doors focused on bulging buses and l trains then dispersed in a cacophony of organized confusion one figure remained unchanged amid this turmoil each morning a man holding a magazine high repeated everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die this sage comment attracted my attention and that of other bustling transferees risking a glance i noticed the cover displayed a tall slender bearded man wearing flowing robes the thick halo surrounding his head found its light quickly absorbed by a brown face even workers soured by the necessity of rising before dawn smiled sweetly at the inference that our lord was a negro brown and white faces transmitted smiles across racial barriers mutely judging this representation ludicrous they proceeded toward train connections that night my wife lucy little league star billy and five year old daughter sharon laughed as we discussed the funny man with the magazines lucy suggested i purchase a copy to show neighbors believing race relations to be strained sufficiently we decided the suggestion was inopportune in retrospect i recall no one ever bought a copy of the bearded mans magazine next day the fellow was present at the station which was obviously his regular post that second night during dessert the family joked about the black jesus man then little sharon dropped the bomb daddy she gulped pulverizing a strawberry suppose jesus were a negro children can say the funniest things and i smiled all the way to the office after that remark the third day conditions were the same but now i studied the faces of the passersby since the same people used this transfer point by midweek they had grown accustomed to the salesman i detected few smiles and wondered if other sharons had introduced doubt in other minds on succeeding mornings i evaluated the faces noting the expressions varied between mirth resentment and confusion by friday the resentful group owned my allegiance sharon didnt help showing us copies of dusky semites and displaying dark faces from her religious story books my daughter seemed to enjoy our mounting discomfort to avoid censure she amended her queries by purring might christ be partly negro with the arrival of sunday the joke had gotten less humorous i decided to buy the silly magazine planning to refute each argument the salesman wasnt there that night a voice reiterating everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die precipitated nightmares fortunately the car was available then followed my mistake in visiting young omalley at the parish rectory the reverend father sensing distress encouraged me to speak my excessively tense voice startled even me as i blurted could christ have been black after a few moments hesitation the priest answered truculently why not surprised by the brevity of his reply i snorted fiercely thats a hell of an answer and steamed toward the door calming me with an apology father explained god the father of all could conceivably send his son as a blend of all men since each of us needed redemption i got out of there fast on the way through the church it happened glimpsing the communion rail the thought struck next time i go to communion ill be swallowing the body and blood of a nigger hurrying to the public library i checked out several books on social customs during biblical times but i couldnt summon the courage to read them havent been to church since lucy made me promise to visit the psychiatrist the night i almost slapped little sharon for asking to go for a ride on the number bus this damn recorder is almost out of tape one last thing must a man be called insane who buys six hundred new water pumps randma looked at the clock and shook r her head in disbelief she had about an hour left before grandpa came down he was always on time you could set your watch by him hed be down this morning at seven she smiled that mans like a rock strong and always there she stacked all the ash trays on the drain board their dark stained bottoms gave off a heavy odor that suddenly made her ill she thought she still saw the white clouds of smoke hanging over the table but they were gone she opened the window picking up a newspaper she fanned in the sooted morning air she remembered the time there wasnt much left the table cloth had been white enough for a tv ad but that was over twelve hours ago now it was spotted with coffee cigarette ashes liquor and handshands that had been rubbing across its fibers hands wiped on it and hands cold with perspiration nervously fingering and palming it as they waited the turn of chance the table cloth came off then the blanketpadding ill have to use a lot of bleach to get this one clean she mused she didnt like to use too much bleach not good for the cloth tears it to pieces she wiped the oak table clean she liked her oak table it was old and warm its grain was wide open stained a little but warm and well used she never believed in using a table cloth she liked the wood too much she found herself thinking about too much this morning guess im getting old cant seem to think about what i should be about whats the use of covering up this wood just being here means youre going to get a little soiled whats a few stains i like to look at some things and know that theyve been used and loved guess thats all because ive been here so long she set a place for paul his large cup was to the left of his plate his fork knife and teaspoon were to the left also after the first six months of their marriage shed learned to set the table right for him margie her friend had washed the dishes god there was plenty of them shed had a big crowd there last night more than shed had for a long time twentyfive pounds of ribs forty pounds of chittlins a mess of coldslaw and bread had all disappeared there was no telling about the coffee think i had about five pounds theyd eaten more than shed thought yet something against all her reason had told her to buy a lot this time cant go wrong when you listen to yourself she sat down for a while her legs were tired an aching tiredness that seemed to be creeping up into her thighs lucky the kitchens a good size id never be able to handle a crowd like this if it was one of them small ones she was up again she put the shoeshine box beside his chair at the table she stood tall almost stretching but too tired to try it she noticed her feet sliding across the floor she didnt have the strength to lift them but to mattie it seemed as if her large heavy frame belonged to someone else feeling somewhat distant and uninvolved in this worn out tired fat hulk she moved about doing what she had to do the hot water was on eggs bacon grits and toast the toast had to be done lightly grandpa didnt like his toast burnt and didnt like it done in one of those machines either she put three slices of bread in a tin pan and slid it into the broiler maybe i got high blood pressure maybe i ought to go on a diet i shore do tire easily now but you just cant stop a game because youre tired you got to let them play had to stop them early in the first place aint never goin to have him come down on a game know how he feels and thats that his wants come first thats that her breast hung lower than usual this morning they were at her waist line she looked down at herself it was an impersonal and curious examination remember the time when you were something to look at look at you now my god lucky you got a man you sure couldnt get one now not even a old one fact is you couldnt get a dead one the grits were boiling shed wait a few minutes before putting the biscuits in the oven she wanted them to be hot for him thats how he liked them shed done real well this weekend she hadnt counted her take but she knew that shed done better than anybody else in the neighborhood her players were more than gamblers they were her friends they came and kept coming she smiled if youre goin to do somethin you might as well do it right im proud of my games theyre the best round thats fact theres no gettin around it either she couldnt understand jims boy hed been there last night mattie had always liked him in fact she still did what happened last night hadnt changed that but she just couldnt understand him trying to pull one over on her he shouldve known better theyd run through all her new decks all she had was five new decks on hand five had always been more than enough but not last night no last night some had a run of good luck but some had a run of bad luck too good luck and bad luck always seemed to run together its just a question of what side of the coins facing up or going to fall when luck is running bad some of the players would try anything cleaning their glasses sitting tight and motionless as their hearts almost burst through their chests with the fall of each card drinking coffee by the pot others whiskey without ever showing it calling for new decks as though all the other decks theyd touched during the night were cursed or worse alive with hatred for them shed watched her players over the years she knew them and they knew her she didnt argue with them about their ways not even when some of them got loud and cursed a bit too much she just didnt want them to wake paul up and they didnt they seemed to remember that he was upstairs and quiet down sometimes shed have to give one of them a look thats all it would take her players were one big family they were her children her brothers and sisters yet mattie often wondered about her saturdavrelatives the quiet knowing that each had about the other bluff was impossible each knew the other too well more than their money and time they brought their innermost selves to the round oak table and a bit of each was placed with each bet and a bit lost with each pot the winnings never seemed to balance things out they were always looking for those bits and scraps that got away the last time mattie had seen it all happen even to herself theyd all grown old around the oak table each came and humbly offered himself to the game hoping for a sign an omen a bit of luck after all the psychology and odds had been stretched to the end fate spoke the final word so they played each saturday using their skills of a lifetime knowing how little they counted without lucks blessings mattie as well as the rest knew something else they loved the game and loved to challenge and prick the lady perhaps to force her smile her blessing how could jims boy know anything about their saturdays their game had everything to do with living nothing to do with winning but winning was important too just how would you explain all this to a young boy you just dont because you cant mattie sent jims boy to buy five new decks he was younger than the rest of the players but he was jims boy they played several hands then jim noticed the white borders on the back of the cards some of the borders were thicker in places jim snatched the cards from the table and thew them against the wall his hands were quick and one lashed noisily across his sons cheek the boy left jim was mad his anger hung heavy over the table stilling and stiffening the players sarah bless her she started talking fast soon everybody was listening sarahs words had buried the boys cheating it was just nonsensetalk at first then she got quiet and started up again it was about her marti her daughter i know people are talking about her it aint true either shes just developed fast thats all shes goin to marry ralph hes her age aint nothin to all the talk about ed why hes twice her age and a lot more aint nothin to it there was just the betting and faces naked and still staring at the table i dont know what to do this things ripping my insides out god the heads raised and the faces looked at sarah she breathed hard i pass big bill spoke up next it aint easy livin ill take two cards it aint easy tryin to make it but we just keep tryin sarah lifes like a bad joke you hear for the first time sometimes the more you think about it the funnier it gets well the more you think about livin the funnier it gets but it just dont get funny until you get some of it behind you then you can laugh then it seems like youve always been a child doin and thinkin childish things then its funny real funny and the jokes been on you but too much thinking had gone by paul was coming down mattie waited paul grunted his mornin there was a twinkle in his eyes mattie smiled at her old man he was short just a bit shorter than mattie his thin wrinkled brown frame was straight he moved slowly and unsteadily but with a tall pride he brushed his shoes and at the same time he looked her kitchen over mattie tried to walk without limping or dragging her feet the pain was still there and still hurt when she moved but it didnt hurt anymore when she walked it just made it hard for her to walk paul watched but said nothing he polished his old cracked shoes mattie had tried for years to get him to polish his shoes before he got dressed he never would so shed always put the shoeshine box next to his chair at the table she still didnt like it he always managed to get a little shoe polish on his white cuffs or socks but shed learned to live with his ways his brush strokes warmed the shoes to a bright shine he looked for his rag a few beads of water and the rag then the black leather would raise a shine like glass in the sun he looked at his right heel the rubber on the outside was almost down to the leather mattie sat opposite her husband his hands were a bit shaky as he pushed his butter into the biscuit slowly he went about his eating it was a serious business with him she watched satisfied with his silent chewing and expressionless enjoyment theyd had a good life together each had managed to stand tall and free of the other but theyd been together in their living she felt sad she remembered telling him some years ago how much she loved him and how good he was all this took place many years back during the time when she believed that everything had to be said he answered mattie youre the good one and once more the strong one i just got sense enough to know that i find my joy in what i know i mean what i know down deep about the both of us occasionally he looked at her his eyes smiled he wanted to speak to say something but he thought better of it mattie was breathing hard it looked as though her shoulders were pulling up her stomach in order to get air into her her eyes were red the long curly hair under her chin seemed longer sometime ago shed used the long black and gray hairs framing her forehead to cover the bald spot at the back of her head now the long black and grays in the front were fewer and no attempt was made to cover the back she just brushed it accepting in amazement what the years had done to her her jaws hung loose her neck and chin were one run of flesh disappearing into her chest paul stood and brushed off a few crumbs from his clothes with the back of his hand he rubbed most of the crumbs off his lips and chin mattie you dont look well ought to go back to bed you mustve had a fitfall night last night go on back to bed and rest some more plan to paul i plan to go back paul left slowly he walked down the street his head was low his blurred gaze followed the irregular cracks and ridges in the sidewalks he too felt tired hed wanted to say something to her but there was no way now too much too long had changed any talking about some things after all he hadnt been fair with her hed helped her in this game of theirs and couldnt go back on her now it meant too much to her mattie rested on the couch in the living room just a little sleep and ill be back strong again she thought of her man everybody loved paul he was a good man top deacon in the church he was a real christian everybody said so she even said so hed always been the same a good man shed respected him for that shed never do anything to harm or hurt him people just accepted her for what she was she loved her cards and couldnt take much of churches her paul wasnt like all the other christians he lived his religion she went to sleep paul walked up the bridge over the railroad tracks and yard it was a harder and longer walk this morning but his pace was steady and shoulders high nothing seemed quite right this morning yet everything seemed right but in a different way although tired and weary inside his spirits felt light and free although his legs were heavy and troublesome to lift they felt young and vibrant he couldnt reconcile all these different feelings god he muttered you know i aint never professed to be nothin but what i am you know that ive always been just that and nothin else you know that too somehow i feel like some kind of imposter people just think im somethin that i aint i cant tell them what i am aint sure i know that i cant tell them how i feel either seems like if i told them the truth id hurt so many of them i dont like hurtin people you know that lord but im tired im tired of lettin them believe i dont think i can go on much longer pretendin i aint really pretendin lord but they treat me with so much respect for nothin just for nothin lord they think im so good because i just dont do nothin but that aint bein good lord you know and i know that a man that just dont do aint much sittin and bein aint bein good you got to tell them lord i dont think i can keep on with it he opened the front doors of the church for over the last thirty years he was the first one there on sunday morning at seven fortyfive each sunday morning he opened the doors the nightcooled air moved into the church with him the sun warmed the large doorway and brightened the center aisle usually paul dusted the pews and pulpit although he dusted yesterday evening he liked to go over everything just one more time with everybody coming in on sunday morning looking so nice he didnt want anyone to get dirty by coming to church today he felt a little too tired he sat on the deacons bench it was his bench theyd made him a deacon forty years ago hed been a deacon a long time he never did anything never said anything about how the church was run hed just been a deacon sometimes a praying or singing one he closed his eyes and took a nap hed feel a bit stronger after a while he was weary right now he still could see the sunlight making a warm path down the center aisle he couldnt really see it but his closed eye lids were bright and warm mattie tried to rest shed slept for less than an hour it was a worrisome time for her she couldnt help thinking about her paul yet she was the one ailing she started to get up but didnt sometimes bein strong is lettin other people be she wondered what paul had meant it didnt make too much sense to her her games were taking too much out of her she thought about giving them up but what would her saturdays be like she didnt need the money anymore there was nobody but her and paul the kids were gone but she had her games it was her saturday nights she looked forward to them they meant everything to her without them she wondered what her life would be like everybody needs something she had her saturday nights paul went to bed so early on saturday night well he had to church was always on sunday sunday school the sunday morning service then the baptist young peoples union finally evening service paul needed all his rest for sunday she needed hers for saturday night didnt seem like she could quit she half hoped that hed find out about her games and tell her to quit itd be so easy for her then she wasnt quite sure that he didnt know or suspect but she did know that hed never said anything to her thats what counted hed never said a word when the two deacons knocked at the door she yelled come on in its open they stood over her her whole left side was on fire shed never hurt that way before but it was a funny thing for her to feel it it felt off in the distance it was almost as though it were happening to somebody else and every now and then she felt one of his pains she wondered who it was and what was wrong with him oddly enough she also felt that it didnt hurt as much as it could or even shouldve the pain was burning through her chest she looked down expecting to see her tiredflat bosom smouldering soon bursting into flame the tall one spoke first mattie it just happened so peacefully like we thought he was asleep we didnt know he was dying until the morning service just when the preacher took his text he fell off the bench he tried to say something about a game i dont think i understand exactly i think it was something about a game she came to once she stared from behind the plastic oxygen tent and smiled
discrimination has struck at the heart of the american j yti l dreampromise of freedom and equality of opportunity tnc for over years it has gnawed at the political and vs g social fabric of america at times threatening to over c whelm us it has exacted high costsin human suffering economic loss a loss that approached billion in inferior education blighted neighborhoods and infant mortality to mention only a few racial discrimination has been a serious handicap to our foreign policy especially in our relations with the peoples of the developing nations of asia africa and latin america as the republican candidate for the united states senate i advocate a broadlybased massive assault against all remaining forms of discrimination in american life i call for an open societya society which extends to all americans the freedom and opportunity to have equal justice under law to obtain quality education to enjoy decent housing and good health and to gain equal access to the economic benefits available in a free enterprise system in order to achieve an open society the thinking and approach to the problem of civil_rights must be redirected there must be a major shift in emphasis in current programs i suggest three guidelines a coordinated comprehensive strategic attack the problems of racial discrimination are interrelated they occur in discernible patterns patterns of segregation in housing are reflected in de facto segregation in schools substandard education is correlated with high rates of unemployment limitations on employment and the opportunity for vocational advancement in turn restrict income and economic mobility discrimination is a system that will yield only to a coordinated comprehensive strategic attack in recent years other than civil_rights groups the federal government has borne the brunt of this attack but state and local governments and the private sector of our nation our universities churches our labor unions businesses and civic associationsmust be allies an excellent example has been massachusetts which has actually moved in a direction that is well in advance of the federal government if this nation is to deal with more than the individual symptoms a constructive partnership will be needed between the public and the private sectors at all levels metropolitan planning the problem of discrimination against the negro is no longer a regional problem the experiences of depression war and population migration have made it a problem of national scope increasingly focused in our metropolitan centers of population negroes who have moved to the nations cities have been excluded by economic and racial barriers from the predominantly white residential suburbs the growing ghettos of our central cities with their deteriorating housing inferior schools and generally inadequate public facilities now stand as the greatest challenge to the achievement of an open society if the nation is to resolve the problems stemming from racial concentration in our cities it will need metropolitanwide planning it cannot be bound by local prejudice or by the inertia of poorly conceived governmental programs too many federal programs stop with the central city when the basic problems of discrimination are much wider here must be a willingness to experiment with enlarged governmental districts intergovernmental compacts new site locations for housing schools and other public facilities and programs that link two or more communities in the metropolitan area in substance a new metropolitan perspective must be applied to virtually all facets of discrimination in our urban society without such planning the problems of the ghetto will become insurmountable vigorous enforcement of the law another guideline for any effective civil_rights program is vigorous enforcement of the law the national administrations failure to enforce civil_rights laws has caused great disappointment title vi of the civil rights act of bans discrimination in all federally assisted programs but not until may of did the secretary of health education and welfare announce that federal funds would be withheld from school districts that practice discrimination one year after passage of the civil rights act the united states commission on civil rights found that there were discernible patterns of noncompliance in nearly twothirds of the hospitals surveyeddespite the fact that each hospital had received financial assistance from the federal government weak enforcement can be traced in other areas to inadequate planning and staffing moreover some enforcement procedures have proved to be ineffective tools in rooting out discrimination the complaint system for example has generally proved useless because the burden of filing court suits has been placed on the victims of discrimination existing civil_rights law must be a more potent weapon in the war against segregation and discrimination legislation must be vigorously enforced enforcement agencies must be provided with adequate staffs to provide the necessary leadership and those laws which contain inadequate enforcement procedures must be amended these principles should guide our attack in the following major areas of discrimination in american society i education twelve years after the supreme court decision on school segregation virtually no progress has been made in desegregating our schools only about six per cent of southern negro children attend school with white children in both the north and south negro schools are almost always inferior in quality to white schools and both negro and white school children now receive an inferior education to the extent that they are not being prepared to live in a pluralistic society the elimination of segregation from the schools is the most critical issue facing american education today the united states office of education sets the guidelines under which school systems must desegregate the most recent guidelines of march are considerably stronger than those issued in the past however despite the may deadline for filing compliance agreements for the school year by mid july school systems in the south had failed to submit plans for desegregation as a first step for meeting government demands close to more school districts had submitted agreements but attached conditions that may prove unacceptable upon review in the face of this open defiance of the civil rights act of no federal funds were withdrawn from school districts that discriminate until may of this year and only districts were affected at the time whereas segregation in the south has traditionally been supported by law northern style segregation commonly referred to as de facto segregation has risen primarily from community custom and indifference segregated patterns of housing and gerrymandered school districts in philadelphia percent of the pupils enrolled in public schools are negro in manhattan percent of the children are nonwhite in washington d c percent of the pupils in public schools are negro and the percentages are increasing the tragedy of the ghetto however involves more than the racial concentration of our schools as psychologist dr kenneth clark states segregation and inferior education reinforce each other the quality of education invariably suffers the federal government has taken no action in the north in the mistaken belief that the mere threat of withholding funds would force school districts to take steps toward ending de facto segregation but even this threat has been removed with the recent announcement by secretary of health education and welfare john gardner that title vi of the civil rights act of did not apply to de facto segregation recommendations to meet the crisis in education faced in the north and south alike i strongly urge that the following steps be taken action on school desegregation prompt and vigorous enforcement of title vi of the civil rights act of banning discrimination in all federally assisted programs is required the federal government must not hesitate to cut off funds from school districts which fail to meet the governments standard to assure this end congress should provide adequate staff and funding for the enforcement operation of the office of education and should increase its initial appropriation of to desegregating school districts congress should enact title iii of the administrations civil rights bill of which would strengthen the office of the attorney general in desegregation suits ttiis section would allow the attorney general to file desegregation suits even if he did not have a written complaint and local residents were financially able to sue on their own behalf reducing racial concentration shortterm measures such as the pairing of schools busing for example the metropolitan council for educational opportunitiesbetter known as metcoin massachusetts and open enrollment while quite useful should not be regarded as permanent solutions to the problem of racial imbalance an adequate solution will require metropolitan area planning congress should move to clarify the ambiguities contained in title vi of the civil rights act of by enacting legislation which makes de facto segregation of schools illegal and provides for the withholding of funds from school districts which practice de facto segregation the federal courts should be given the authority to enforce the provisions of the law at present massachusetts is faced with an anomalous situation in which state funds have been withheld because of de facto segregation in the boston school system while millions of dollars are poured into the city by the federal government federal grants issued under title i of the elementary and secondary school act should be used as incentives to metropolitan planning federal funds issued for school construction should be used to break up rather than strengthen the patterns of segregation the states in cooperation with the federal government localities and private sector should implement effective metropolitan planning in education such planning should include the enlargement of school districts new transportation patterns and the construction of new schools aimed at reducing racial concentration educational parks in particular represent a promising bold approach to the problem of achieving quality education and more racially balanced schools these school complexes would assemble on a single large campus children from an attendance area broad enough to include both majority and minority children the concentration of students teachers and resources would result in richer programs and more services than any individual school could provide their strategic location would help alleviate the problem of racial imbalance as well teachers and curriculum teachers can play a vital role in upgrading the quality of education and in school integration where practice teaching is done on a segregated basis the federal government should take action under tital vi of the civil rights act of state departments of education and local boards of education should actively recruit and train qualified teachers who are negro congress should provide adequate funding for the national teacher corps an imaginative effort aimed at breaking down the vicious cycle of poverty and ignorance in rural and urban slums a comprehensive system of preschool centers for underprivileged children operating both during the school year and during the summer months is required the hightly successful operation headstart program should be expanded systemized and imaginatively administered finally new methods of curriculum should be devised textbooks should reflect a more realistic view of the role of minority groups in our history for millions of negroes housing means the lack of free choice in selecting a place to live and congested ghettos that breed broken homes delinquency illegitimacy drug addiction and crime since world war ii the pattern in housing has been new homes in the surburbs for white families with rising incomes and old homes in central cities for negroes indeed the trend in recent years has been accelerating because i believe the situation in housing has reached crisis proportions i strongly urge that the following steps be taken banning housing discrimination the administrations housing bill banning racial discrimination in the sale rental or financing of all types of housing represents a potentially important advance in assuring freedom of choice in the open market this legislation is a significant step toward achieving the promise and spirit of the constitution and the declaration of independence nevertheless the administrations method of attacking discrimination in housing ignores a more potent instrument the president could deal with the problem of discrimination in housing more effectively by issuing an appropriate executive order president kennedys executive order no banning discrimination in fha and vafinanced housing covered per cent of the total housing supply by extending the executive order to all housing financed through banks and savings and loan institutions whose deposits are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic more than per cent of the housing supply could be covered in the absence of an executive order the administrations bill should be supported however it should be strengthened in its proposed methods of enforcement the concept of a federal fair housing board with effective enforcement powersadopted as an amendment in the house judiciary committeehas sound precedent in numerous state open housing laws states and local governments should also take the initiative in ensuring open housing massachusetts has strong fair housing laws they have been widely accepted by the citizens of the commonwealth eighteen states now have similar housing laws on the books these laws should be strengthened and vigorously enforced the massachusetts republican platform of calling for increased funds and authority for the massachusetts commission against discrimination should be implemented housing low and moderate income families our present federal and state housing programs have been hampered by inadequate funds poor planning and the power of suburban areas to veto housing plans thus confining subsidized housing to the core city ghetto a coordinated effort between our public and private sectors is urgently needed to increase the rate of housing production for low and moderate income families the present rate of housing production is only million units per year most of this housing is priced beyond the reach of families below the median income level housing production must be increased to at least million units per yearat least half of which should be made available to low and moderateincome families both federal and state governments and private sources as well should contribute toward filling this gap congress should provide funds for the department of housing and urban development hud to conduct research in such areas as the amount of substandard housing and the need for lowincome housing in the nation so that federal programs may be directed to the areas of greatest need the rent supplement program recently approved by congress should be made metropolitan wide in scope by elimination of the amendment allowing local government to veto rent supplement projects as originally introduced the rent supplement bill was designed to encourage the development of housing throughout the metropolitan region and to rent a portion of these new units to low income families under a supplement program the local veto amendment minimizes the possibility of locating units outside of congested city cores metropolitan planning any attempt to reduce racial concentration in housing must necessarily involve the dispersal of lowincome families through metropolitan planning the various governmental units must undertake joint ventures to meet the problems of both desegregation and increasing the supply of low and moderate income housing on a metropolitan areawide basis districts within the metropolitan area should be rezoned and provisions made for low and moderate income housing programs these programs should be comprehensive enough to provide for community services and transportation networks to other areas federal and state housing funds going to local governments should be used as incentives for the development of metropolitanwide plans for low and moderate income housing revitalization of the ghetto on a longterm basis the plight of the ghetto can and will be relieved by an open market in housing and meaningful planning of low and moderate income housing outside of the central city in the meantime we must utilize our present resources to rehabilitate the ghetto it is not enough to tear down and renovate our slums equally important is the need to link the physical rehabilitation of the slum to the social rehabilitation of its inhabitants the administrations demonstration cities bill represents a new approach to the problem which deserves to be tested however the program is deficient in its failure to embrace the entire urban community the program should provide incentives for planning on a broader scale for those areas in which the problem of segregation transcends the boundaries of the central city community action programs provide people living within the ghetto the opportunity to improve their situation through cooperative effort they also serve to call the publics attention to the substandard living conditions of the invisible poor to be effective these programs will require imaginative approaches by governmental agencies at the local state and national levels iv employment l millions of negroes remain untouched by the wealth of our affluent society the unemployment rate among negroes is seven per cent more than twice the average for whites often negroes can only find employment in lowskilled lowwage occupations and industries with the lowest growth rates and the most limited opportunities for advancement moreover these jobs are most vulnerable to the rapid pace of automation joblessness among negro youth is a particularly acute problem as of april per cent of outofschool negro youths between and were unemployed twice the rate for white youths in the same category these unemployment figures are reflected in the mounting welfare budgets of our major cities recommendations no single simple quick measure can eliminate these critical problems i strongly urge the adoption of a broadly based action program which includes the following points new enforcement powers for the equal employment opportunity commission title vii of the civil rights act of which prohibits discrimination by employers unions and employment agencies should be strengthened at present the equal employment opportunity commission created by the act to carry out title vii can only investigate complaints of discrimination and then seek conciliation if no redress is possible the individual must take the initiative in seeking redress in the courts because of the complaint system the eeoc has had only negligible impact on employment discrimination in addition the eeoc has been hampered by insufficient investigative powers and resources limited enforcement powers which are complicated and ineffective and a lack of administrative authority to undertake or coordinate manpower development or economic opportunity programs in support of its enforcement activities title vii of the civil rights act of should be amended to authorize the equal employment opportunity commission to issue cease and desist orders against individuals engaged in unlawful employment practices and to order back pay to those who have suffered financial loss through the denial of equal employment opportunity state fair employment practices commissions a number of states have made important advances in establishing state antidiscrimination commissions however the effectiveness of these state agencies has often been limited by inadequate financial support and excessive restraint in enforcement states should take the initiative in strengthening state fair employment practices commissions eliminating discrimination in trade unions in spite of the progress made by labor unions to promote equal employment practices a number of unions continue to discriminate against negroes unions have a special obligation to make a place for those against whom they and employers have too long discriminated i urge therefore that government contracting authority in accordance with the civil rights act of and an executive order banning discrimination on work done by federal contract be used to insure equal employment practices and expanded training opportunities on all federal projects it is regrettable that the department of labor and justice did not initiate action against trade unions to enforce nondiscrimination on government contracts until february unions on all levels evaluate and revise all programs and practices that discriminate unfairly in job placement job training or advancement national union leadership should take affirmative action against unions that continue discriminatory practices unions increase job opportunities in the skilled crafts and building trades by a actively recruiting negroes and others into craft unions b establishing preapprenticeship training to help negro youths qualify for apprenticeship programs metropolitan job councils metropolitan job councils should be established by private sources in all major urban areas to plan coordinate and implement local programs to increase job opportunities for negroes membership should include representatives of business organized labor education and other appropriate community organizations these councils would accumulate uptodate information on the negro labor force and job opportunities in the area and would help coordinate and improve existing programs technical assistance would be offered by the councils to help employers and unions make positive efforts to recruit negro workers and eliminate unnecessarily rigid hiring specifications rural employment programs many marginal farmers have become victims of mechanization shrinking acreage allotments and racial prejudice the migration of unskilled rural negroes to urban areas has created additional problems between and the number of negro farmers decreased by per cent to meet these problems i recommend that the secretary of agriculture move immediately to implement the recommendations of the united states civil rights commission aimed at the elimination of segregation in department of agriculture programs the secretary has made little progress in implementing the report which is now over a year old the department of agriculture extend to negro farmers the necessary assistance information and encouragement to give them the equal opportunity to diversify their farm enterprises federal state and local agencies and private groups as well cooperate in the development of comprehensive programs to facilitate the adjustment of rural families moving to urban areas centers should be created in rural surplus labor areas to help potential migrants make arrangements for jobs and housing and should provide vocational and personal counselling employment programs for negro youth programs for intensive counselling of negro youth the sector of our population with the highest incidence of unemployment are grossly inadequate the need exists for yearround youth job placement services counselling services for inschool youths should be improved and expanded with the aid of skilled vocational advisers acquainted with requirements of industry expanded high school vocational education programs are also needed in urban and rural areas to train youths effectively for occupations in which employment opportunities are available business and industry should work closely with schools and labor unions through metropolitan job councils where possible to gear inschool training realistically to job requirements and to broaden inservice training opportunities negroes are subject to more illnesses and disabilities than white people they lose between one and onethird times as many days of work from disease or disability and have a higher infant mortality rate and a seven years shorter life expectancy the figures are integrally related to poor living conditions and inadequate health care the effects of inadequate health care are compounded by discriminationespecially in the south despite the fact that title vi of the civil rights act of bans discrimination from health facilities receiving federal funds widespread discrimination against negroes still exists negro doctors dentists and technicians are all too often refused staff privileges and excluded from professional societies negro nurses are excluded from training programs paid lower wages and forced to eat in segregated cafeterias and negro patients continue to be placed in segregated wards the persistence of this discrimination can be traced in large part to the failure of the u s department of health education and welfare to take steps necessary to achieve compliance with the law effective enforcement action has not been taken except in cases where complaints have been filed field inspections have not even been made to ascertain the extent of noncompliance to remedy these abuses in medical care i strongly urge that the following steps be taken enforcing compliance in health care hew should conduct surveys and thorough field examinations to determine the extent of discrimination in federally assisted health programs funds should be withheld from those hospitals which continue to discriminate against negroes in violation of the civil rights act of finally hew should take steps to ensure that hospitals participating in the medicare program comply with federal laws against discrimination improved health services while the new programs of medicare and medical aid for the indigent represent increased provision of medical services to low income families many of whom are negro they should be supplemented by additional experimentation in the concept of neighborhood health centers which provide a range of health services on a coordinated basis to all members of the family in a single location the neighborhood health center sponsored by tufts university in the columbia point housing development is an excellent example of how health services can be more effectively delivered to low income families that would not otherwise receive them comprehensive study and evaluation of ways of improving the quality and availability of medical services to low income families in both urban and rural areas medical research organizations both private and public should undertake thorough studies to examine the causes of the negros high infant mortality rate and lower life expectancy and should develop a comprehensive plan of attack on these problems the continued disparity between the negro and white population in these vital statistics is cause for deep national concern protecting negroes and civil_rights workers the tragic shooting of james meredith in mississippi was one in a series of violent acts committed against civil_rights workers since an estimated thirty negro and white civil_rights workers have been murdered in the south while countless others have been the victims of beatings bombings maimings and shootings the continuing failure of allwhite juries to convict assailants has in addition focused the nations attention on the gross inequities in the jury system in the south we can no longer tolerate a system of justice in which negroes and civil_rights workers are not free to exercise their constitutional rights we can no longer postpone fulfillment of our national pledge to liberty and justice for all it is time to guarantee that justice will be done throughout the nation a number of bills pending before congress and sponsored by republicans and democrats alike are designed to remedy these flagrant abuses i urge that congress enact a strong civil_rights bill during this session one that includes in this area the following provision for a representative crosssection of the population on jury lists thereby eliminating discrimination on the grounds of race or color in jury selection removal of certain criminal cases to the federal courts where state jury selection procedures are not in accordance with federal procedures greater federal protection against intimidation of negroes and civil_rights workers including stronger federal criminal penalties for those who deprive individuals of their federally protected rights amendment of the united states code so that local county and city governments are held jointly liable with officials employed by the government who deprive persons of rights protected by the code establishment of an indemnification board within the federal government with authority to grant money damages to the persons whose federally protected rights have been violated voting rights the voting rights act of largely removed the legal barriers to voting however apathy fear and ignorance continue to impede negro registration and voting while congressional action in the area of voting is not now needed the administration must take the lead in enforcement it has not yet enforced the law in large areas of the south notably georgia beyond enforcement the administration must provide more imaginative and innovative voter registration education where it has sent federal examiners pamphlets and posters in all federal facilities advertising voter registration might be used finally voter registration hours should be better advertised in southern communities home rule for the district of columbia since the people of washington d c have been under the jurisdiction of the congresstheir pleas for selfgovernment largely ignored the situation is made more intolerable by the fact that per cent of the population is negro while ten members of the powerful house district committee are from the south that this situation should exist in a nation which prides itself on its democratic principles is deplorable enough but that such a situation be permitted to continue in our nations capitol is reprehensible attempts to get a home rule bill through congress this year have once again failed but this issue must not be allowed to die i strongly urge congress to act and to restore democracy to our nations capitol once more f fcmg r the challenge of a great society cannot be fulfilled until we have achieved an open society with equal opportunity for all americans to obtain quality education enjoy the minimum comforts of decent housing sustain a potentially healthful existence and gain access to the material benefits of our abundant free economy this challenge is a particularly fitting one for the republican party as the party of lincoln to undertake it is a challenge underlined by the noble purpose and inspiration of a uniquely american dream for over the course of more than three centuries we have dared to seek r strength for our society by giving freedom to its members we have liberated common men and women and have discovered uncommon faith and power we have dedicated ourselves to the importance of the individual and have achieved unparalleled greatness as a nation as a people we must now fulfill the promise of that dream we must build a truly open society where all men have the right to achieve their individuality where every man has the right to participate in the american dream art of blending militant action with practical politicking as one of martin luther king jrs lieutenants in the campaign to end slums in chicago he is a cool and articulate spokesman for the aggrieved negro community and as director at jesse jackson is a seasoned veteran of the civil_rights struggle of the sixties but with a difference he has mastered the fine of operation breadbasket the jobgetting arm of the coordinating council of community organizations cccosouthern christian leadership council sclc coalition he spearheads a drive which brought chicago negroes jobs worth some in the first six months of the programs existence an associate pastor at fellowship baptist church in chicago the rev mr jackson is a student at the university of chicago divinity school he is a native of greenville s c and a graduate of a t college in greensboro n c where he was president of the student body and also served the community as field secretary for core he moved his family to chicago so that he could study at the seminary and he plans to remain in the ministry the heavy demands of the freedom movement notwithstanding at a time when many activists his age are rejecting the notion of nonviolence the rev mr jackson remains its advocate his confidence is as indomitable as his six power as dej till scribed by its initiator i k stokely carmichael g chairman of the stukscji i tvt dent nonviolent coordinating committee sncc is both a slogan and a political and psychological technique as a slogan it has the value that others do but as a technique for achieving change and rallying together the most powerless groups in american societythe negro poorit has enormous potential the national reaction to both the slogan and technique has been directed for the most part by advocates of a counter position in the white and negro communities those who are spokesmen for white fright contending for the national title as leading spokesman for the white fright advocates is eugene patterson editor of the atlanta constitution believing as do most white frighters that negro militancy equals riots rape and in a favorite phrase of white fright supporters irreparable harm to the negro movement the constitution under patterson has devoted almost more editorial space in recent weeks to denouncing black power than he has to supporting his papers hawkish position on the vietnam war it is too easy to characterize the opponents of black power as weakkneed moderates or even as clever divide and conquer manipulators who aim at destroying the surface unity that exists among the various negro civil_rights groups the white fright position is basically that american whites have admittedly been brutal and oppressive with years of white power therefore black power will mean that negroes will be brutal and oppressive if they ever get the upper hand this masochistic wishful thinking both deplored and welcomed as proof of the incompetency of negro militants springs from a desire to eliminate the militantand therefore uncontrollable sectors of the negro movement it amounts to little more than a refinement of the mccarthy eras redbaiting techniques and might well be called blackbaiting but the best analysis of the white fright conditionand its reaction to black powerhas come strangely enough from a white metropolitan daily newspaper the boston herald whose lead editorial reexamining black power on july reads black power has claimed its first two victims they are vice president hubert humphrey and roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp both men honored veterans of the civil_rights movement succumbed temporarily at least to the most ancient of maladies the inability to adjust to a new idea the editorial described humphreys criticism of black power as racism and apartheid and gave wilkins description of black power as black death it went on to say we find nothing subversive in sncc chairman stokely carmichaels remarks on the contrary says the herald this type of thinking is both practical and traditionally american nor should the older generation of civil_rights leaders object to the young negroes wanting to run their own show with white men supporting rather than dominating the various organizations this should be interpreted as a sign of maturity it means that negroes having won their legal rights under the old system are now ready to work toward their goals under their own leadership like any other minority this too is traditional american history does not show that the irish were content to be led by yankees or that working men were content to be led by their employees in short we are suggesting that the older generation of civil_rights leaders avoid the mistakes of hubert humphrey and roy wilkins and resist the urge to panic at the sound of black power judiciallegislative front the writer defined the new challenge facing negro leaders as the building of pride selfrespect and selfesteem and confidence of negroes as a group such advice was not taken then and probably wont be taken now but the challenge is still present and the recent disruptions in the civil_rights movement over the term black power clearly indicate that the need is more urgent than ever and that nethe editorial ends with a warning to both white and negro advocates of white fright we suggest that the older civil_rights generation reexamine this new concept of direct action and concentrate on the more thoughtful speeches of black_power advocates these young men are surprisingly realistic and are fully aware of both their capabilities and their limitations and like it or not they are destined to be the doers of the new era of civil_rights whether they do good or evil depends in part on whether their predecessors encourage or repress them apparently the a civil rights move ment has now reached s a p int wherein the old ways of doing things can no longer disguise the fact that our present tactics cannot budge the immovable stumbling block white americas rigid determination to keep black americans in their placewhich most of our leaders have long pretended would give way in only a matter of time the only alternative to the civil rights movement itself it seems to me would be stagnation or riots and more riots i think that what we really need is a complete reevaluation of the aims and methods of most of our civil_rights organizations also i believe it is long past time when we should stop pointing to the token gains made by the few amongst us and turn our full attention to the plight of the deprived and relentlessly oppressed many i think too that we must stop deluding ourselves with the belief that there are many white people of good will who are eagerly standing by to help in our allout fight for complete equality that there are some white people of good will cannot be denied but it should be obvious to all black folk by now that such white folk are few and far between if we are ever to find any solution to our increasingly intolerable situation we must go to the people themselves to our unfortunate brothers and sisters left behind in the shanties and the shacks and the teeming ghettos and listen to their ideas for only those who face the enemy qua enemy on a daily basis can really know the magnitude of the battle that lies ahead and only they can really know how they want to conduct their fight and i believe this is precisely what sncc has been doing and why directly or otherwise it has come up with the term black power i believe this is snccs way of trying to inculcate in black people the idea that if we are to survive we must somehow gain a sense of solidarity and rid ourselves of the old feelings of helplessness and inferiority that have always paralyzed us in america that sncc has really hit upon something can be readily ascertained by the instant and overwhelming hostility shown by the national press and a majority of those in the white community to ward this one twoword slogan to be sure it is more than just a slogan it is symbolic of a possible way of life a way of life that terrifies the white american even before it is realized for if we finally wake up to the fact that we too have power we will no longer willingly play the lackey for the white man who will then not only lose some of his selfcontinned from page esteem when he loses his ancient doormats but this same white man lives in constant fear that we will some day enslave our former masters that this idea is utterly irrational is beside the point after all if man were wholly rational he would never have been a bigot in the first place would he the current crisis facing f rtt y the civil_rights movement has the quality of death written in characters of blood fire and selfdestruction it is a killer stalking human preyand finding tj only americans without hearts religion intellect or democracy the american dream is failing so to speak and americans are proving to be just plain white people living a democratic lie in a nondemocratic society americans are proving by their actions that they are psychologically incapable of developing a native and original multiracial culture america has become a land of guiltridden illiterate and fearful proletarians white men and black men have failed to discover each other white mothers fear for their daughters black mothers fear for fear of their husbands amalgamation is not a concept but a condemnation to a nation tall and tense such is the stupid dread of a christian society a nation of christians spitting on priests and nuns and negroes here is the sad evidence of another rome in ashes but nero is a realtor heard in the choir on sunday mornings nero is a white homeowner or businessman standing against the windy sunlight looking for cleopatra in the ghetto nero is the black man afraid to give up his belly needs for his dignity this land of lincoln and du bois cries for interracial hot blood as a monument to its stupidity in spite of all the prophets in spite of all the warnings and sincere whites and blacks we shall not overcome unless a blackwhite jesus arises or willie mays picks up a gun instead of a bat the alternative is blood or blessedness everything or nothing it is black brown and yellow men against the western sleepwalker and at the same time it is the population asking the rest of the human race to preserve humanity black men must take by any means they can the blindfold from justice there are some wars in which a careful disorderliness is simply good tactics and whoever said that the socalled black revolution is anything else but a war against ignorance any man can die or be destroyed for his country but only a negro an american negro there is no other can save it if black power causes fear then black men obviously cause something profoundly deeper in the minds of many white americans richard wright wrote of black_power as a tool to be used by black men everywhere for the sole purpose of freeing themselves black power is black powder unjamming those solid mountains of white power and hatred black power may mean black people making decisions and building strong pyramids along the vile banks of hate in america white america is not aware of such dragon and suggestive language from the negro community black toms have not used such humorless and truthpiercing phrases before the outcries stem from to my mind the fact that white people have for so long put their words into the mouths of negroes that they cant imagine the coming of strong new voices unrelated to marian anderson or ralph bunche my opinion is that the civil_rights movement is not at the crossroads per se the very nature of the movement itself dictates that crisis become an integral and accepted part of its existence what the civil_rights movement is after is a chance for black americans to share in the power and the privileges which have previously been allocated to the whites and a negro elite it is a struggle to get the powerful and the privileged to relinquish their inequitable grip and let people in america share in the wealth and potential of america as americans and not as negroes jews orientals puerto ricans and wasps as kenneth clark states in the negro american no group of human beings can easily and graciously give up power and privilege such change can only come through conflict and anguish and the everpresent threat of retrogression being an underdog minority movement civil_rights is constantly subjected to emergencies and pressures and crisis is never any further away than the next confrontation with whites the next split in leadership or the fight against racism itself becoming racist having witnessed the civil rights movement survive both neardefeats and defeats i can only state that the fervor and determination for a successful resolution to the blight of racial inequality is so deeply rooted as to allay any fears that may exist about there being some ongoing form of active and dedicated civil_rights activity we have now lived with more than a decade of civil rights agitation for many this has become one of the basic elements of existence they cannot even remember when this was not an issue vital and pressing in their lives they are not going to be turned back but if the questions posed above refer to the fact that it would appear the movement is at the crossroads regarding what form of strategy will be utilized then i believe we have a more fruitful question for debate typically civil_rights thrusts have been basically nonviolent in nature the largest groups within the movement up until recently have steadfastly maintained a peaceful posture with the advent of the slogan black power and the vagueness and frustration that it represents there is a new crisis in the civil_rights movement as i mentioned earlier crisis is the common denominator of the civil_rights movement the question is of course is this new crisis of significant impact to actually represent enough of a threat to make significant numbers of people see it as an actual choice or alternative to nonviolence as the basic strategy characteristic the original question essentially asks what is the alternative to the nonviolent tactic in the struggle for equal rights the only practical alternative i can see to nonviolent tactics on the part of negroes is a wholesale and genuine acceptance and implementation of equal rights on the part of whites just as i do not see white america relinquishing its preferred position voluntarily so i dont see any long term practicality in black violence too many negroes are becoming involved in pragmatic answers to a basically moral and ethical question this makes us subject to the same kinds of expediencies and rationalizations that greatly account for the position we find ourselves in vizavis the whites negroes trying to explain and distinguish kinds of violence remind me of whites trying to justify separate but equal my response to question number two is that black power is subject to the same vagueness and great latitude of interpretation as is any slogan attempting to simplify a massively complex thing such as the emotion and feeling of people we americans have a deeprooted fear of the word power our whole national trend is based on the fear of power being concentrated when we link this basic fear and distrust of power with the basic fear distrust and ignorance of black humans we have something that both fascinates and frightens whites the press is alert and very swift to pounce upon anything of this nature in its business of making headlines the public reaction if we can identify one was similar to that of people discovering that unidentified flying objects do in fact in some form exist it is frightening because for so long we were told they were objects of the imagination suddenly we are faced with the realization that some strange force in a somewhat identifiable form which may or may not be harmful does in fact exist for me the essential question is this can the struggle against racism be justified if it in turn becomes racist itself the civil rights movement is being pressed to choose between the peaceful dignified and effective posture of nonviolence and the racisttinged call for defensive violence this defensive violence is not a case of fighting fire with fire but rather a case of lighting a forest fire with matches negroes are a minority in america we have the least money housing education and most important power we are not going to get power commensurate with numbers if we choose to fight the white man with the tools he used to subjugate us we are superior to the extent we press constantly for american ideals and their acrosstheboard fulfillment while the whites ignore them further to the extent we do this in a dignified and intelligent manner we will be more successful in our demands than they in theirs the black nihilists notwithstanding i think that the majority of black americans are interested in nam war and a desire for structural changes in the american economy black power this muchmaligned and misunderstood term simply means the marshaling of all power available to the black communities throughout americapolitical social economicto force the kind of changes necessary to end white oppression black power grows out of a clear realization that there are power forces among whites responsible for this oppression and that counter forces equal or superior in strength will have to be used against white society to end conditions causing racial discrimination so quick and hostile a reaction from whites stems from their misinterpretation traditional fears of negro closeness and more importantly the fear that the customary battle lines in the civil_rights movement will be changed to the advantage of negroes in other words whites could see fighting the battle if the most effective weapon negroes could muster was a feeble appeal to moral conscience arrayed against the massive weight of white economic and political control of negro neighborhoods now that segments of the movement have proposed fighting the battle on different grounds using weapons which propose not only to hurt the white mans conscience but his pocketbook and traditional political position as well whites are taking a second more frightful look perhaps a more fundamental reason for whites adverse reaction to black_power has been their inability to adjust psychologically to the sudden shift in the negro mood from one of patient plodding toward eventual freedom to defiant audacious demands for freedom now their failure to adjust to and accept the political economic and social rearrangements black_power demands made a rash emotional outcry from whites leading to misinterpretation almost inevitable theres no question that the movement is at the crossroads but to understand why j you have to go back to the late s before the term black power became popular during the latter half of the decade and into the early s a combination of historical developments dissolution of european empires in asia and africa the castro revolution in cuba the sitins and freedom rides in the south the burgeoning peace movement among othersproduced a class of impatient young rebels who were grossly intolerant of the gap between americas preachments and practices among these youthful radicals were stokely carmichael marion barry and john lewis all leaders of sncc at one time mario savio and bettina aptheker student leaders at berkeley clark kissinger tom hayden bob ross and other leaders of students for a democratic society essentially these radicals are telling america to practice what she preaches or suffer the consequences in the arena of world politics in the civil_rights movement the leaders of sncc and core heavily influenced by the developments referred to have split off from the more conservative naacp national urban league and sclc because the traditional methods of change have not closed the gap between theory and practice fast enough at the heart of the schism are these burning questions the answers to which will largely determine in which camp the masses of black people will enlist and thusly which road the movement will take from here on can the movement tolerate such a deep split at a time when quest for rights had been doing all their born days this parade saw leaders taking part in a pushshove match with beefbellied cracker cops at one point and spouting pussyfoot oratory over the privilege of pitching a tent at another meanwhile the great white fathers in washington were engaged in a marathon goosestep operation of successive steps to water down sections of this years civil_rights actand an act it is becoming which if the waterdown process continues must stop just short of liquidation pun intended everytime unrest boils up in the black community the white folks simply pass another rights act or bill to quiet them down for a spell but alas the meredith marchers emerged at the back of a pickup truck bed on the campus of a negro college where leaders were revealed to be infinitely more in accord on the matter of who would foot the bills than who would be permitted to caress the mike and serenade the crowd predictably they later wound up chastizing one another and chestizing themselves but in this they were of course doing what they do best entertaining and kowtowing to white folks and wobbly financiers mind you this is not to say that all of the fault of the foregoing rests on leaders alone they can be no better than their followers it is in large part the mental attitudes of their followers which reduce leaders to fundraising gimmicks geared to white pocketbooks and make it virtually necessary that they court coverage in the white press in order to emerge and remain as negro leaders we negroes will never get too far as a group so long as a negro must go through the white press in order to reach us so long as we depend on white sources for information and ideas about ourselves what in my opinion can be done about the situation it is hard to say in a brief discourse but to begin with the movement was crippled from the start by an ultra assimilationist craze for acceptance at all costs into a morally decadent white cesspool now cynically called the great society they have stupidly therefore placed love in a position of priority over respect from which love of necessity in the long run must flow frankly my hope is with the future generations this generation may bethough slightly less so than their parentsalready it is sad to say just a bit too far lost although this is not to give up on them entirely for this reason i like the budding movement for freedom schools i would add as adult counterparts tnt clubs t o w a r d negro togetherness which among other things would periodically hold soul talks and agitate at the grass roots level among negroes for business enterprise and educational achievement these may eventually manage to teach black children what i call an enlightened blackness a dynamic new sense of negritude the main drawback of the schools up to now has been the necessity for using women white mainly as teachers and moderators this is due in large part to the reluctance of negroes to donate their own leisure their fear of blackness and the fact that men are for the most part away at work or standing somewhere watching pretty girls go by or trying to make it to the next broad consequently the black child still suffers a shortage of male models and there is no one to teach black boys the arts of karate and boxing for example as muchneeded psychological mechanisms not so much for selfdefense as this is not no matter what you may have heard the age of flesh and bones alone in weaponry with a new burst of pride the black child also would gain the sense of aggressive persistence necessary for getting ahead in a successcrazed society this is essential provided they are not going to reject capitalism altogether and by rejection i do not mean merely failing to take as tenacious a part in the system as possible a course they have followed in the past why for example are four out of five jewish persons of college age in school two out of five orientals about one out of five white christiansand so few negroes by comparison to argue that it is merely because negroes experience a harsher degree of discrimination is to overlook the fact thatas the foregoing figures suggestmajor groups discriminated against except for negroes mexicans indians and puerto ricans exceed the college entrance standard set by the anglo saxon discriminators what we lack are pride and industry and nothing else will fully solve the black mans problems until he has those things the cohesion necessary for breaking down barriers will flow naturally from that else either the few barriers broken down by other means will seldom be utilized maximally by negroes as a whole so in a larger sense it is not the civil_rights movement socalled at the crossroads it is the misled leaders the uncle toms rev sambos and dr thomases who have come to the crossroads as indicated by their increasing necessity for revealing themselves as toms leading to a teaming up of the toms so to speak as over against the one or two true tigers among negro leaders rev kings dream is daily turning into a nightmare although i do not begrudge him his hallucinations of any sort but if rev king can dream so can i and other children of poverty unlike rev king and discrimination we have a dream of a new army of black men dedicated to freedom manhood and human dignity we have a dream of soon one morning demanding that the white man give us a chance in america and should it not be at once forthcoming we have a dream of preying instead of praying for our equal rights no we are not beyond flaying either nor swinging instead of singing and we foresee a black blitzkrieg already shown bubbling last summer in omaha chicago cleveland and elsewheremaking america a giant mushrooming watts in which this country will either solve its problems or get the destruction it deserves so many negro leaders and other crackpot lexicographers have been taking bushwhacks at the definition of black power that if i didnt know better than to believe a word they say id be completely confused by now whitney young for example opines that black_power is neither black nor whiteit is the green of the dollar bill the maroon of the textbook and the gray of the pay envelope although he is of course quite right on the surface i dont know about that green power talk my pay envelope is brown and whats insidethe paycheckis blue and often leaves me feeling if not looking the selfsame way frankly i feel fairly certain that negro leaderswith the exception of stokely carmichael and floyd mckissickdont know what any kind of power let alone black_power means james meredith for all the effort to educate him in the white folks schools and in africa still thought that a bible had more power than a bullet an uneducated white fellow had to teach him a bit of the power of perfunctory piety that is why they spend most of their time defensively explaining what black_power does not mean instead of what it means they plead that black_power is neither antiwhite nor antiblack i believe that black_power is at least problack that it means being black in all areas of the struggle for black manhood among racesby any and all means available to black men and their allies i suspect any informed person who pretends not to know what black pow er means of telling a baldfaced lie they know the meaning of power the ability to influence another even against his will if necessary and the meaning of black black power then means the ability to make others particularly white folks walk the white chalk line in a way that is of equal benefit to blacks black power would offset political and paycheck brutalitya cause and thereby automatically obliterate the current cry against police brutalityan effect white power means dollar bills billy clubs trick ballotry and bullets black power can someday be all of these too but unlike white power which except for greed and a bullyboy psychosis is wielded without a cause black_power is power in selfdefensebut no less deadly in effect it is a phrase which merely spoken is able to scare the hell out of white folks and that is good however i thought at first they were talking about sexual power about the only area in which we negro males are generally conceded the right to boast of superiority in terms of both equipment and performance and yet as of this writing those who use the slogan appear to believe that it means mainly bloc voting bloc power if you will instead of black_power indeed in another sense white powerwielders can depend on negro leaders to block power rather than blacken it negro leaders including most of those who spout the slogan would be the first to help quell any instance of the use of black_power outside whiteapproved channels hence one function the slogan has is a kind of capacity for separating the black sheep from the colored goats among negro leaders still should some leaders manage to make black_power materialize white liberals would tryand probably succeed intaking it over indeed one of the main reasons for white opposition to the phrase is its threat to white liberal power in the civil_rights movement note that more than preachers almost all white took out a full page ad in the new york times presenting a couple of thousand explanatory words and offering to provide the power structure more on demand to interpret the phrase the white presswhich unfortunately just about everybody gets his cueflew into a rage in a fearstricken effort to befuddle the concept even colored critics threw up the smokescreen of a black state and the difficulty of colored folk getting along together let alone running a state i do not think black_power advocates as a whole are calling for a separate state they appear to believe that as soon as we separate off the white folks will simply drop an atom bomb on us however negroes will eventually have separate cities anyway and now comprising twothirds of the district of columbia will soon have an allnegro state then we can move the white house to howard university and call it the black house even rev kingmay the lord have mercy on his soulprofesses to blame the black_power slogan for sapping the strength of the wobblylegged meredith march prophesies that black_power would be equally as evil as white power and has the holy gall to call on colored folk to think in terms of shared power white politicians quickly caught something of this demoniacal deception hubert humphrey stood with solemnfaced piety and told an audience of purplegummed negro leaders that black men are becoming racists while lbj limplipped a barefaced weaselworded line about being against white or black_power i believe that they see as clearly as i do black judgment day around the corner they can wait and see what it means not only the civil v r g rights movement but i vu the entire united at the crossroads negroes will no longer live on the periphery of the country they are expected to live and die for whites must decide whether it is better to share the country with all of its citizens or to face continual disruption of business as usual resulting in deterioration of all phases of american life for our negro leaders who are fast losing their following there could be no better rallying cry than black power instead of hysterically denouncing this cry the civil_rights organizations should grasp the opportunity to harness the energy of those who have lost hope and are floundering in violence and to channel this unused and undeveloped power into constructive and practical effort toward economic power political power educational power the power to protect ourselves from physical and emotional harm the inner power that comes with selfesteem the power to develop to full stature as human beings the white press is as usual attempting to create the situation it ostensibly seeks to preventan explosion that would obviate the necessity for sharing the power and sell a few newspapers as a side benefit or failing that to suppress the movement by instilling in the white public the fear of reprisal for its crimes and in our responsible leaders fear of censure from liberal whites the only white power that will diminish with black_power is the power of whites over blacks all other white power will increase proportionately since in this country white power plus black_power plus yellow power plus red power equal american power thats the way it is the day the civil_rights movement began it r i ii was at the crossroads su and that day by the way was not the day the proud black lady refused to get up from her seat on the bus it was the day the first black slaves said no to his slave owner and that was nearly years ago the black mans fight for human rights has never been such a socially acceptable thing as it is today but it has always been in motion even though it sometimes manifested itself as no more of a nuisance than a fly on the back of a rhinoceros the thing that amazes me about the whole civil_rights movement though and my black brothers and sisters is that we have been able to strip ourselves of our conditioning and see a reality that our white countrymen have not yet begun to see we have though existing within the framework of this most hostile society dedicated to the perpetuation of black men as inferior beings and make no mistake about it this society is in fact dedicated totallyperhaps even at the risk of destroying the world to the principle that the black man will not be equal been able to rise above our negative conditioning and at this very moment although perhaps they dont deserve it we are plotting the course of saving the whole goddamn world what thrills me about us is our tremendous stamina even though they infiltrate the ranks of some of our best organizations and render them almost totally ineffective another organization is born every time they hamper the established one and that organization fights even more vigorously than the parent group and while it lives in its effective state it slashes away at the injustice about us and brings us still closer to the goals that we will attain because we are not only black and beautiful but we are the children of the most oppressed of our times and we are the ones who are aware of injustice and we are the ones who will right all the wrongs perpetrated against us and our ancestors and we are the ones who will save the world and bring a new day a brilliantly alive society that swings and sings and rings out the world over for decency and honesty and sincerity and understanding and beauty and love what are the alternatives if we are presently at the crossroads the alternatives are simple and i always seem to oversimplify thingsperhaps because i see them so clearly that i dont have to be bogged down in trivia we fight on with every facility available to us and we wait we fight on in every city and town in the country we fight on and we spread the love we have been told we cannot feel for ourselves to each and every black man we meet we fight on and we see in our black brothers and sisters the dignity they tried to tell us they had but we could never know we fight on and at the same time we look about us and wait we look about us and wait because somewhere somewhere in the tenements in harlem or from the west side of chicago or from watts there will be another other white power will increase proportionately since in this country white power plus black_power plus yellow power plus red power equal american power thats the way it is continued from page malcolm and this one wont be murdered there will be another malcom and his words will reflect the emotions the ideas the beliefs the worries the torture of those from the bottom as well as those from the top yes the man on top too because the black man at the top is just as disenfranchised as the man who walks through the alley picking up pop bottles to get the price of his bottle of wine somewhere there will be another malcolm and we will again have a universal voice but even if we dont find another brother malcolm we will still fight on because we are a people who know only one way and that is the way of accomplishment the way of victory weve never really lost you know not even a battle even the fact that we fight is a victory what are the practical alternatives to it i keep thinking of that i laugh to myself because every black man in this country is aware that our time has come yes even those who have sold out and have been granted the luxury of thinking they are white and have been allowed the accept ance of the establishment still feel something when they see their precious black women largely relegated to the role of domestics still tighten up when they see black children suffering in their inhuman world bleed when they hear of a black family destroyed because of a bombing when they pass through the area of the most disenfranchised in their airconditioned automobiles they feel their blackness they know it god dont hate them please because theyll be back theyll be standing in the line when the time comes because their blackness will not let them escape their responsibility to the brave dead blackmen who have made their success possible today without a word passing between them one black man looks at another one and instinctively they know that they will not tolerate another hundred years of economic slavery and if it means that some of us have to die to get our point across to the world then we will die but we will not die meekly we will not die without making our statement its true that we are really no prouder than any other oppressed people in history but we are the last of the long sufferers and as a result of our oppression we have gained a dignity our oppressors can never have and we try just a little harder than the man on top we do just a little better job than he does and we are a hell of a lot more alive god it must be terrible not to be born black in this day and age the fact that core and i sncc have taken difi ferent roads from the naacp the urban league and sclc does not lead me to believe that the civil_rights movement as a whole is at a crossroads where one road can lead to success and the other to disaster the older organizations are continuing in the way they have always taken using legal techniques moral persuasion nonviolent demonstrations and cooperation with whites there has been a tendency in the two younger organizations to develop grassroots leadership and power a tendency which is now coming to the fore instead of taking one road the civil_rights movement is taking two roads in my opinion this is a good thing as the problem of racism cannot be solved by any panacea it needs to be attacked on a variety of fronts by whatever tactics is most effective in a given situation our leaders have used too much energy in fighting and criticizing each other from the utterances of some of them it would seem that other negro leaders are greater enemies to the civil_rights movement than white bigots every one has his favorite solution strategy and tactics but that does not mean that other tactics and approaches are not effective and should not be used i would not consider the civil_rights movement to be at a crossroads because if direct political action fails there is still the alternative of legal and persuasive techniques employed by the older organizations if these methods prove ineffectual there are the techniques of political and economic mobilization already adopted by the other two organizations i think we should beware of expecting perfection or utopia as president kennedy said life is hard some men spend the war stateside and others are killed i think we should constantly strive toward perfection but not be too disappointed if we do not achieve it in my opinion black power means organizing black people so that they can have power commensurate with their numbers in their communities states and in the nation this will mean that they may dominate some communities politically will be a strong force in some states and will wield power in the national government this is similar to what other groups have done in the detroit suburb of hamtramck for instance the poles regularly elect a polish mayor polish state representatives and senators and polish representatives to congress the irish have long dominated boston and recently we had an irish catholic president we have catholic power jewish power italian power and armenian power let there be black power too black people have long voted for whites to represent them now whites should learn to vote for black representatives its the ability of the man which matters not the color of his skin the adverse reaction of the white press to the phrase black power stems from two things the whites attitude toward blacks and their feelings about themselves one of the things which incenses the black man toward the white is his absolute refusal to see the black man to the white he is invisible not there a white makes a movie or a television show about a hospital say where black internes nurses and orderlies are falling over each other but the picture will be lily white there may be a promotion coming up but he never considers competent black workers for the position to him the black man is invisible he does not exist or he may indeed see the black man but through the distortion of his own preconceptions and prejudice sixty years ago if you mentioned black writers to a white bigot he would say a nigger write a book how can an ape write a book today at the term black power many whites have the same reaction the only difference is that it is stated in more genteel language the second reason for the whites reaction to the term black power is internaltheir sense of guilt when you have kidnapped enslaved beaten murdered raped exploited cheated traduced and committed injustice toward a race for years how can you escape feelings of guilt and the fear that they will do to you what you have done to them a people that can burn a man cut off his genitals and toes and distribute them for souvenirs and incarcerate loyal japaneseamericans in concentration camps would have long ago reacted violently to such treatment as they have meted out and they fear the black man will do what they would have done they cannot conceive that he can have magnanimity generosity and compassion so far there is no prominent black leader advocating such violence although some have advocated protecting ones self when attacked as is every mans legal and godgiven right all men are not saints incidentally the only way you can become a saint is through martyrdom and they do not have martin luther king jrs saintly qualities and find it hard to look with compassion upon some policeman who is beating their women or shooting a child or calling them black sonsofbitches black power does not mean violence but it will give black men a sense of pride and of solidarity and will make them unwilling to continue to bear exploitation the direction which black power will take depends upon white power if white power acts wisely and with all speedy urgency in making this a livable country for every man then there will be no reason to fear black power someone has said that p the civil rights movef ment in the summer of with its nonviolent marches and its demonstrations had reached the crossroads i believe it would be more accurately descriptive of the at situation to say that the movement had reached a deadend it was time for a fundamental change of tactics the supreme court of the united states had spoken more than a decade earlier all those magnificent civil rights bills had been passed or were on the verge of passage many middle class negroes and white liberals hailed these landmarks as evidence that at long last america was ready to set a place at the table of the great feast for her black sons and daughters so that they too might eat high on that gargantuan hog known as the great society from the narrow point of view of the black middle class things were a little betterfor the black middle class that is the white establishment had enough affluence now and enough sagacity and audacity to integrate most of them and at least let them sit at the foot of the table by the time the platter got down to them only the leavings were left but at least they were at long last at the table and in substantial numbers and the leavings in collier heights in atlanta and in shaker heights in ohio and on long island and in westchester and in crown heights in brooklyn were we will admit some fairdemiddling leavings this new approach constituted a definite departure from the establishments timetested tactic of tokenism notwithstanding the french have a saying apropos to the situation which translated into english means roughly the more things change the more they remain the same the price the black middle class was called upon to pay was to become an amorphous group without roots or culture dependent entirely on the whims and quirks and ex pediences of the white establishment in a word they were to become white men in black skins they were required to sever any and all connections with the negro masses an act many of them were very happy to accomplish since they had never looked upon their negroness as a thing of any intrinsic value at a time when the unity of black people was an absolute essential for achieving liberation many of the black middle class were ready to throw in the towel the struggle was over as far as many of them were concerned the black middle class seemed to think that what they ate made the black masses fat and that when they prospered the black masses prospered automatically and inevitably meanwhile the gap between the black millions and the black middle class steadily widened at a rate alarming to those who were seriously concerned with achieving economic political and psychological freedom for the majority of black people this should have been and was anticipated by some since it was becoming increasingly clear that the white establishment never had any intention of integrating the black masses even as the country boasted of a great and prosperous society conditions in black ghettos of the great cities and in the southern backwoods worsened thus we had reached not a crossroads but a deadend in the racial crisis so now in the waning months of the question is posed is there an alternate route i think there is i have for a long time thought that there were many roads to the promised land and the tragic thing is that we have sent all our forces down a single highway and not even the main one but a detour i believe the main highway to black liberation is through a total unification and galvanization of black strength throughout the nation and that nothing short of this will achieve the victory the struggle for integration is pure sham if we do not go to the integration table prepared to negotiate from strength black strength block by block in the teeming cities plantation by plantation in the southern backwoods and the countryside black folk must be organized for an assault upon the holy citadels of white power integration comes after liberation a slave cannot integrate with his master in the whole history of revolts and revolutions integration has never been the main slogan of a revolution the oppresseds fight is to free himself from his oppressor not to integrate with him integration is the step after freedom when the freedman makes up his own mind as to whether he wishes to integrate with his former master for integration to have any real meaning other than reenslavement for the former slave the former slave must approach this decision to be or not to be a part of the great society based on a position of strength all else is total hatinhand abjection here am i old massa take me thus the concept of black power or black consciousness is an idea whose day has come it is not a new idea but it is an idea that the situation requires yes demands this concept calls upon us black folk to unify our strength politically economically psychologically and culturally it calls upon us to write our own history create our own myths and legends washington and jefferson do not belong to our black children they are not the founding fathers of black americans they are not our legendary heroes they were our peoples slavemasters no amount of falsification of history can disguise this fact our legendary heroes are nat turner frederick douglass denmark vesey harriet tubman sojourner truth white john brown and red sitting bull these and many more are our heroes and most of us have never heard of them black consciousness carries with it of course the right of selfdefense men are not free unless they affirm the right to defend themselves frederick douglass understood this more than a century ago understood it profoundly out of his own lifes experience reflecting on the time he turned upon covey a cruel slavebreaker who flogged him daily and worked him past endurance and kept him on starvation rations one day douglass turned on covey and soundly thrashed him douglass writes this battle with mr covey was the turning point in my career i was a changed being after that fight i was nothing before i was a man now with a renewed determination to be a free man the gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow even death itselfi now resolved that however long i might remain a slave in form the day had passed when i could be a slave in fact black power is not an advocacy of violence it advocates nonviolence but in depth it keeps everybody nonviolent it stays the hands of the practitioners of violence nonviolence which denies the right of selfdefense encourages and precipitates violence on the part of the practitioners we black folk have a deep need to defend ourselves indeed we have an obligation we must teach the brutalizers how it feels to be brutalized we must teach them that it hurts theyll never know unless we teach them black consciousness means placing less stress on moving into white neighborhoods and putting more creative energy into changing our own neighborhoods from citadels of despair into monuments of hope it means that all the harlems of the usa should be in the hands of harlemites this is the starting place for black liberation to create black politicians answerable to black constituents and not to the white bosses downtown black teachers and principals in charge of our public schools in charge of shaping the lives of black children and giving them some sense of pride and dignity and beauty in their blackness of course the teachers will have to undergo a great deal of debrainwashing since many of them are as contemptuous of black children as are most of the white teachers of whom they are but terribly bad imitations black power works toward the day when black folk will control the economic destinies of their communities it seems to me there need be no strong schism at this moment between the advocates of black_power and the black bourgeoisie if one of the principal tenets of black consciousness is economic power the starting place is with the black middle class may their tribes increase black power advocates are no present danger to them one of the great dangers clear and present is the steadily growing chasm between the black middle class and the black masses and he who contributes to this widening gap plays into the hands of the white establishment why is there this tremendous reaction from the white establishment to this new concept of black_power and why is there this violent paranoiac reaction from the poor white man let us consider the latter first that is the poor white man he need not feel threatened he has nothing that black consciousness wants fundamentally he is as powerless as the black man the only thing he has that black men lack is his white skin and that is the one thing black power does not want black consciousness affirms the dignity of blackness affirms the beauty of our blackness but the white establishment in which all the power is vested does have cause to worry because the black mans aim is to retake the power stolen from him centuries ago some white politicians are certainly threatened the white leeches in the ghetto are threatened those who feed upon the ghettos misery power has to come from somewhere since it does not create itself out of a vacuum therefore black_power must necessarily weaken the stranglehold of the white power structure especially in the black communities this then is what the jumping up and down is all about it isnt that the members of the white establishment do not understand the implications of black power and black consciousness on the contrary it is precisely because it understands more deeply than do many of us black folk bedford stuyvesant in brooklyn has black citizens and has never enjoyed black representation in the congress of the united states the white persons representing bedford stuyvesant now are threatened by the concept of black power the same can be said for many areas in the northern cities and in the rural areas of the south and every other place where black folk outnumber white folk for if black power means anything at all it means one man one vote it means an end to taxation without representation black consciousness also threatens the power of some gentlemen in the trade union establishment yes there are some unions even some progressive ones whose leadership is white and entrenched and whose membership down through the years has become almost entirely black yet this black membership is not reflected in the toplevel leadership hence we have white presidents of black unions undoubtedly some of these white men have given able leadership notwithstanding the days of great white fatherism are numbered on this earth and these leaders good bad and indifferent must be classified as being among the last of the great white fathers there has been no parallel in history to the negro experience in the usa american slavery and the slave trade were undoubtedly the crudest episodes in the entire history of mans inhumanity to man by comparison roman and egyptian slavery were humanitarian experiments considering all the carnage connected with the slave trade the to million lives lost in the middle passage considering the physical brutality connected with the plantation life during the days of american slavery the injury and brutality inflicted upon the minds and souls and personalities of black folk were the crudest aspects of american slavery the most diabolical and deliberate the white ancestry of this country took a great and prideful people and brought them in chains across a mighty ocean thousands of miles from the land of their fathers broke up their families and clans and tribes robbed them of their language broke their personalities down bit by bit and forged them into niggers cruder still they made black men believe they themselves were niggers and therefore deserving of their lot as slaves it has been a long tedious journey from slavery to this place this moment in the last part of the twentieth century far far too many of us still regard ourselves as niggers but as we have mentioned before one of the main tasks of black consciousness is to affirm the beauty of our blackness to see beauty in black skin and thick lips and broad nostrils and kinky hair to rid our vocabulary of good hair and high yaller and our medicine cabinets of bleaching creams to deniggerize ourselves is a key task of black consciousness to rid the world of niggers is the black mans burden and now we want to proclaim black consciousness is not racism it is unequivocably antiracist its firm dedication is to rid the world of racism black consciousness does not teach hatred it teaches love but it teaches us that love like charity must begin at home that it must begin with ourselves our beautiful black selves it advocates a love so powerful that it will settle for nothing short of love in return therefore it does not advocate unrequited love which is a sick bit under any guise or circumstance most black folk have no need to love those who would spit on them or practice genocide against them furthermore in the present confrontation love and hate are total irrelevances profound love can only exist between equals generally speaking a slave cannot love his master any slave who does is out of his mind his cottonpicking mind but masters have always needed to believe in the myth of the loyal slave the loving slave hence the myths of uncle tom and gunga din and aunt jemima were pure figments of the white mans wish fulfillment some black folks historically have felt an obligation to act out the image to play the coon role according to the script written by the great white fathers some of us still have a need to play the role correspondingly most white people today demand that black folk either love them or hate them so long as they do not profess indifference to them there is this pathetic need in most white americans for the black man to be obsessed with them one way or the other finally black consciousness understands that the nigger having been invented to justify american slavery ultimately became the rationale for colonizing three quarters of the human race thus there evolved two kinds of homo sapiens on this earthexploiter and exploited a master race of white men and a subservient race of niggers thus evolved such concepts as the white mans burden and the noble savage our mutual heritage with the people of africa and even on a broader basis our mutual experiences with all the colored peoples of the world visavis the white man create a bond between us and colored people everywhere black consciousness proclaims that our struggle for liberation is a part of the great revolution sweeping the entire world a revolution against all the great white fathers in every nook and corner of this earth in this context we black americans are no longer a minority but a part of that vast majority of humanity yearning to be free and struggling with every ounce of their strength to throw off the blackmans burden and the yoke of white supremacy we are a part of that fellowship of the disinherited which will surely inherit the earth in this century we are dues paying members in the brotherhood of blackness what ultimately became v worjy the outstanding result i yv of the neg r family debate was the excuse it created for a slackening of action to solve the problem that the debate was supposed to be about for a government that wanted to cool it to avoid action that could no longer be avoided without having to take the blame for inaction the moynihan controversy provided an ideal distraction this conclusion of two eminent sociologists writing in washington universitys transaction points up a lesson that can be drawn from the fuss that has been stirred up over the meaning of black power the distraction developed in the white press only after vicepresident humphrey and a negro leader who remains enchanted by president johnson kicked off the excitement by equating black power with black racism the debate that ensued has become almost too tiresome to review in detail it has been dominated by intentional misunderstandings and baseless imputations that have put some sections of the movement even sympathetic white journalists into a state of confusion and disarray a nation that should be awakened to the evils of white racism of the present day and that must be enlightened as the result of white racism of the past is distracted this year by the black power scarecrow as it was last year by the negro family fuss it is fair to suggest that a government that wants to avoid confrontation with white racism so that it can get on with the war so splendidly supported by racist allies like john stennis senate military affairs committee and mendel rivers house military affairs committee is pleased to have provided a new diversion as a minority experienced in the selforganization needed to combat persecution and imbued with the selfrespect that has provided morale for that combat american jews should have had no difficulty in recognizing and welcoming the advocacy of black power for many generations we have used in the confines of our family circle a phrase whose meaning was never very different is it good for the jews this was a touchstone for viewing political and international developments it was a factor seriously debated before every election it never stood for a parochial jewish supremacism or racism it was a way of expressing the race pride that went into the racial organization that was so successfully employed in combatting vicious antisemitism and in watering down the antisemitism of the polished gentlemens agreement variety we developed organizations which while never having used the phrase jewish power built a power structure that has contained and pushed back antisemitism in the case of the antidefamamation league as harry golden has pointed out in a little girl is dead the very origin of the organization was as the reaction to the lynching of a jew in atlanta by the same foe that the negro freedom movement is fighting today i take pride as a jew in the contributions these organizations jewishled and jewishstaffed have made during the decisive stages of the civil rights revolution one of the really meaningful breakthroughs in the fight against the racism that has characterized public schooling was the antidefamation leagues publication of a study on the treatment of minorities in secondary school textbooks what the relatively powerless association for the study of negro life and history had been saying for years was now picked up and pressed as the position of an organization that was trained in the use and application of power getting itself heard and getting its message across a staff member of the american jewish congress made what i believe was a pioneer suggestion in a paper on job equality at a core conference on job equality in it is not yet official ajc doctrine and the seed has as yet rested on barren soil still there is promise for the future in staff attorney joseph p robisons thought in particular there is hardly any question that existing seniority rosters and waiting listsfor jobs union membership or training programs can be nullified if they were built up at a time when discrimination was in effect they are tainted with illegality and cannot be relied on this and the many major official contributions made by the american jewish congress to the cause of interracial justice far outweigh the negative performance of one of the organizations leaders who resigned in a huff from the national board of core because the organization chose to investigate before acting on the mt vernon incident that incident involving a temperamental and to me wholly understandable if not forgiveable outburst by a local chapter spokesman provoked beyond endurance by the participation of some local jews in the resistance to school integration was blown up out of all proportion by the sensational character of the resignation the subsequent attacks on core did a great disservice not only to the cause of equality and justice for the negro but i daresay provoked and stimulated the very antisemitic sentiments that were supposed to have been protested by the resignation it had and has an unintended side effect it provided a lesson in the importance and justification of black power in its most basic sense that negroes are now in control of their own decisions and no longer want or need whites in key positions of civil_rights groups to quote jonathan randals formulation of the concensus of negro and white students at this summers national student association conference the white liberal veto power over thought and action that comes from a whites being in a position where he can use the threat of the damaging effect of his resignation as a lever to influence policy is dead wrong and its elimination was long overdue a temporary cessation or slackening of the support of those who do not understand this is an unfortunate but necessary price to pay this is not to say that all white liberals are evil or do not have the depth of understanding necessary to continue to be welcome as aides and participants rabbi a j heschel for one sensed the importance of negro leadership and negro decisionmaking when he wrote two years ago in jewish world that the problem is above all the regeneration of the moral vigor of the negro great spiritual resources of the negro still lie untapped black power can be the key to reaching the masses of the oppressed in the ghettoes whose untapped resources are the key to achieving as tom wicker of the new york times has suggested the unfulfilled promises of the past who is the lawbreaker wrote mr wicker the man who takes his rights by violence or the man who withholds or stifles or trifles with the rights of others as a jew who remembers that the rosenwald fund financed years ago the work and study that made possible the publication of dr w e b du bois black reconstruction i take pride in recalling that the phrase black power was coined over four years ago by the brilliant historian lerone bennett jr in his synthesis of the first reconstruction that was later published as a chapter in his before the mayflower the lesson du bois taught repeated and retold by bennett was that the first reconstruction failed not because there was too much black power but not enough as a member of the naacp i take pride in the fact that the basic premises the real meaning of black power were first set forth by loren miller then a national vice president of the association in his position paper farewell to the liberals first published in the nation and officially reprinted and distributed in by the naa cp i rejoice that the rest of the movement is catching up with his conclusion to liberals a fond farewell with thanks for services rendered until you are ready to reenlist as foot soldiers and subordinates

without regard to race color creed or sex now in effect it is imperativeindeed screamingly imperativethat we of the staffsided sex hairy chests all organize immediately a male citizens council to crush this insidious sexual rights movement race color creedthese are not important but sex if men are to preserve their male way of life their traditional male supremacy they must join together now in a militant male rights party on a platform of total segregation of the sexes this creeping equality must be stopped these sexual agitators must be made to understand that feminine equality besides being ungentlemanly violates all the edicts of science and god innumerable studies have again and again proved that there are anthropological differences between the sexes that the male is the superior sex and that if the lord didnt believe in segregation he wouldnt have created two different sexes in the first place segregation is therefore right and natural let us gather behind our banner male supremacy forever and faithful to our symbol the crowing rooster march out to do battle with these ironfisted federalists in washington who would crush our beloved way of life they must be stamped outfor their own good for blinded by their progressiveness they fail to see the results of intermingling the sexes paternity suits divorce cases unwed mothers population explosions unwed fathers and worst by far mongrelization yes gentlemen by all thats right and natural mongrelization will be the result of this radical new law that forces us to give a woman a mans job can you imagine for example what will happen when a man walks into a mens room and finds a woman attendant this is the sort of thing they do in france and look what happened to that country it has never been publicly admitted but every waterloo that nation has suffered has been caused by a skirt fluttering about in that most hallowed of male strongholds the mens room another example the takeoff is delayed because the pilot talked on the phone minutes to her copilot about what she was going to wear on the flight to atlanta the copilot answered in minutes that she was wearing an offtheshoulder wild blue yonder

new barber with bangs when the stuff hits your shoes you dont care because the shoeshine girl did a hellova job anyway by this time youre ready to become an ugly green giantuntil you find out shes not wearing green this season i tell you men if this new sexual rights law is allowed to continue it will besides leading to mongrelization spell the end of our traditional system of separate but equal facilities the only answer is total segregation of the sexes im not prejudiced mind you some of my best friends are women in fact when i was a kid one of them took care of me but that certainly doesnt mean that i want my son to marry one now we of the male citizens council or male rights party would take care of our womenfolk just as weve always done wed keep them in hair curlers and bobby pins and girdles let them live on our property see that theyre fed call them familiarly by their first names and bury them but that doesnt mean they have to vote why should they even want to vote protected as they are or go to school much less with us they lead the school dropouts anyway you start going to school with them you start marrying them and you know what that leads to too if you marry them they cant help but think theyre as good as you are and if they start thinking theyre as good as you are the only thing left to do is to ship them back to where they came from let them lower their own property values for a change see how they like it in other words theres nothing wrong with women people as long as they keep their placeand their smell its bad enough smelling their perfume on the street much less having to sit next to them in a restaurant and smell it women simply have no right to agitate for sexual equality theyre being misledby atheistic communists who are preying on their prejudices its prejudice pure and simple theyre prejudiced thats all in fact if these female sexual agitators dont watch themselves theyre going to end up worst than negroes so what about it mr male us of a its up to you organize call a male citizens council meeting tonightif you can sneak out of the house at a time when most black thinkerswho are not necessarily negro leaders have alloted to the white man the task of saving the white man it is a rare pleasure to read william stringfellows dissenter in a great society holt rinehart winston many moral men have separated from the church viewing it as an integral part of the apparatus that sends the havenots the wretched to the gallows of degradation but stringfellow in his christian view of america in crisis is something other than the executioner who would use christianity as a noose with eyes not blinded by western lye lie the author views poverty property and people charging this society with the idolatry of money the dominant ethic of white supremacy and the placing of property rights before human rights he brings to bear some of the keener observations yet made on the subject matter the idolatry of money has its most grotesque form as a doctrine of immortality writes stringfellow suggesting that money is the basis of ones moral worth in america he observes that if one leaves a substantial estate death is cheated of victory for a while if not ultimately defeated because the money he leaves will sustain the memory of the man and of his fortune he adds the poor just die and are at once forgotten stringfellow calls institutionalized private charity a monster so heavily oriented toward its own maintenance that it has little left over to meet the empirical needs of those whom it purports to help in a word the author sees the current war on poverty as simply more political exploitation citing mayor richard daley and his chicago machine as perhaps the most aggravated example in the nation on the warfare between the races as he calls it suffice it to say that stringfellow tells white americans exactly what crimes they have committed against black people and reflects for them precisely what they themselves have become in the procss at best paternalists at worst racists he suggests that the difference between a mayor daley or a mayor yorty and a governor wallace or a bull connor is one of aesthetics not ethics stringfellows message to his white brothers conversely conveys why today in america moral black men can scream get whitey and feel absolutely no remorse over the inclusiveness of their battle cry he candidly states the massive indifference of the ordinary white citizen of good intentions is the moral equivalent of the perfidy of the white racists the profound apathy of the white moderates is ethically tantamount to the radical impudence of the white racists stringfellow contends that white supremacy must be exorcised if there is to be reconciliation between black men and white men but not unlike most black thinkers he does not see reconciliation as a likely prospect he thinks instead that the white establishment will use its military forcewhite powerand forsees what he calls the day of wrath and it is in this confrontationwhich it seems the events since his writing have brought even closerthat stringfellow summons white christians to a most specific witness which he says must surely be the same as the witness already given by so many negro christians during those long years of anguish and protest the witness of the cross if white people are to practice alas what they have preachedwhich would indeed be a metamorphosis without historical precedentthis witness according to stringfellow demands that they not protest even if the knife is at the belly at a time when moral and immoral men alike have grown tired of the gospel one rather doubts that this lay theologians message to the white man will inspire a more humane relation to self and others than did the message of the messiah for whom his doctrine is named but however one might feel about stringfellows interpretation of what white people must do it is a testament to his moral courage that he has quite impressively related to them the painful truth of what they have already done and persist in doing and for black people who can afford to buy bookswho are usually those still trying to join middleclass white americaperhaps this five buck investment will prove antidotal towards the quest for what stringfellow calls a fair share of the emptinessd llorens bernard malamud is justifiably considered one of the best serious writers in the united states his book the fixer farrar straus and giroux merely adds to the impressive credentials contributing to his present status the fixer joins the assistant the natural and others of malamuds studies of the nature and character of people times and places malamud has the ability to develop a mutually complementary character and story line by that is meant that the character and story actually flow together and seem to belong in the same book the fixer is a russian jew a little after the turn of this century the story takes place in russia but it is readily apparent that witha few subtle changes the story could have taken place in any number of localities to any number of minority groups it is the universality of the plot giving the book its broad base of appeal which makes it a really good book the jew is unjustly caught in a mire of prejudice suspicion and the law as he passes for a gentile in order to get a better job and is later caught coincidentally with his arrest for ethnic trespassing he is charged with the unsolved murder of a young boy the most moving and impressive exhibition of malamuds talent is displayed as he traces the activities and reactions of the fixer to jail the fixer ultimately becomes a martyr not because he is a brave man but because he happened to have the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the right time it is impossible to do malamud and his book justice in a few short paragraphs let me suggest therefore that you buy and read it for yourselfbrooks johnson he edge of the spia y ral of musicians probe sat crosslegged on a blue cl th his sopra sax resting against his inner knee his afrohorn linking his ankles like a bridge the afrohorn was the newest axe to cut the dead wood of the world but probe since his return from exile had chosen only special times to reveal the new sound there were more rumors about it than there were ears and souls that had heard the horn speak probes dark full head tilted toward the vibrations of the music as if the ring of sound from the six wailing pieces was tightening creating a spiralling circle the black audience unaware at first of its collectiveness had begun to move in a soundless rhythm as if it were the tiny twitchings of an embryo the waiters in the club fell against the wall shadows dark pillars holding up the building and letting the free air purify the mind of the club the drums took an oblique magwas hands like the forked tongue of a dark snake probed the skins probed the whole belly of the coming circle beginning to close the circle haigs alto arc rapid piano incisions billys thin green flute arcs and tangents staces examinations of his own trumpet discoveries all fell separately yet together into a blanket which mojohn had begun weaving on bass when the set began the audience breathed and probe moved into the inner ranges of the sax outside the sound barrier club three white people were opening the door jan a tenor sax case in his hand had his game all planned he had blown with probe six years ago on the west coast he did not believe that there was anything to this new philosophy the musicians were talking about he would talk to probe personally he had known many negro musicians and their struggles to be themselves were no different from any other artists struggles including his own things were happening so fast that there was no one who knew all directions at once he did not mind ron and tasha coming along they were two of the hippiest ofays in town and if anybody could break the circle of the sound club it would be friends and old friends of friends ron was bearded and scholarly thickset shabbily dressed but clean he had tried to visit the club before but all of his attempts had been futile he almost carried the result of one attempt to court he could not understand why the cats would want to bury themselves in harlem and close the doors to the outside world rons articles and reviews had helped many black musicians but of all of them probe adams had benefitted the most since his graduation from yale ron had knocked around the music world once he thought he wanted to sing blues he had tried but that was in college the best compliment he ever got was from mississippi john or muddy waters one of the two during a civil_rights rally in alabama he had spontaneously leaped up during the rally and played from his soul muddy was in the audience and later told ron boy you keep that up you gwine put me back on the plantation ron was not fully satisfied that he had found the depth of the black mans psyche in his book he had said this yet he knew that if he believed strongly enough some of the old cats would break down his sincerity was written all over his face holding tashas hand he saw the door opening tasha was a shapely blonde who had dyed her hair black it now matched her eyes she was a vassar girl and had once begun a biography of oliver fullerton excerpts had been published in down beat and she became noted as a critic and authority on the fullerton movement fullertons development as an important jazz trombonist had been interrupted soon after tashas article no one knew why sometimes tasha was afraid to think about it if they had married she knew that oliver would have been able to continue making it but he had gotten strung out on h sometimes she believed her friends who said oliver was psychopathic at least when he stopped beating her she forgave him and she did not believe it when he was really hooked she still loved him it was her own love protected deep inside her encased her little black secret and her passport to the inner world that oliver had died trying to enter it would be only a matter of time she would translate love into an honest appraisal of black music i am sorry the tall brown doorman said sessions for brothers and sisters only whats the matter baby jan leaned his head in and looked around as if wondering what the man was talking about i said man if you cant recognize a brother you better let me have your job he held up his case were friends of probe the man called for assistance quickly two men stepped out of the shadows whats the trouble brother these people say theyre friends of the probe what people asked one of the men he was neatly dressed a clean shaven head with large darting eyes he looked past the three newcomers there was a silence finally as if it were some supreme effort he looked at the three im sorry but for your own safety we cannot allow you man what you talkin bout asked jan smiling quizzically are you blocking brothers now i told him i am blood we friends of the probe the three men at the door went into a huddle the doorman was skeptical but he had seen some bloods that were pretty light he looked at this cat again and as the other two men were debating whether or not to go get probes wife in the audience he decided against the whole thing he left the huddle and returned with a sign which said we cannot allow nonbrothers because of the danger involved with extensions jan looked at the sign and a smile crept across his face in the street a cop was passing and leaned in the doorman motioned the cop in he wanted a witness to this he knew what might happen but he had never seen it jan shook his head at the sign turning to ron and tasha he was about to explain that he had seen the same sign on the west coast it was incredible that all the spades believed this thing about the lethal vibrations from the new sound the doorman was shoving the sign in their faces as the cop a big pimpled irishman moved through the group all right break it up break it up you people outside want to come in the other two men inside seeing the doormans decision and the potential belligerence of the whites folded their hands buddhalike the doorman stood with his back to the door now listen officer if these people go in the responsibility is yours the irish cop not knowing whether he should get angry over what he figured was reverse discrimination smirked and made a path for the three he would not go far inside because he didnt think the sounds were worth listening to if it wasnt harlem he could see why these people would want to go in but he had never seen anything worthwhile from niggers in harlem dont worry you got a license dont you let them go through said one of the doormans friends suddenly a peace seemed to gather over the faces of the three club members now they folded their arms and went into the dark cavern which led to the music in front of them walked the invaders see said jan if you press these cats theyll cop out they moved toward the music in an alien silence probe was deep into a rearaction sax monologue the whole circle now like a bracelet of many colored lights gyrated under probes wisdom probe was a thoughtful fullheaded black man with narrow eyes and a large nose his lips swelled over the reed and each note fell into the circle like an acrobat on a tight rope stretched radially across the center of the universe he heard the whistle of the wind three ghosts like chaff blown from a wasteland clung to the wall he tightened the circle movement began from within it shaking without breaking balance he had to prepare the womb for the afrohorn its vibrations were beyond his mental frequencies unless he got deeper into motives he sent out his call for motives the blanket of the bass rippled and the fierce wind in all their minds blew the blanket back and there sat the city of samson the white pillars imposing but how easy it is to tear the building down with motives here they come probe healed of his blindness born anew of spirit sealed his reed with pure air he moved to the edge of the circle rested his sax and lifted his axe there are only three afrohorns in the world they were forged from a rare metal found only in africa and south america no one knows who forged the horns but the general opinion among musicologists is that it was the egyptians one european museum guards an afrohorn the other is supposed to be somewhere on the west coast of mexico among a tribe of indians probe grew into his from a black peddler who claimed to have traveled a thousand miles just to give it to his son from that day on probes sax handled like a child a child waiting for itself to grow out of itself inside the center of the gyrations is an atom stripped of time black the gathering of the hunters deeper coming laced in the energy of the sun he is blowing magwas hands reverence of skin under the single voices is the child of a woman black they are building back the wall crumbling under the disturbance in the rear of the room jan did not hear the volt nor did he see the mystery behind probes first statement on the afrohorn he had closed his eyes trying to capture or elude the panthers of the music but he had no eyes he did not feel ron slump against him strands of tashas hair were matted on a button of rons jacket but she did not move when he slumped something was hitting them like waves like shock waves before his mind went black jan recalled the feeling when his father had beat him for playing with a nigger and later he allowed the feeling to merge with his dislike of white people when he fell his case hit the floor and opened revealing a shiny tenor saxophone that gleamed and vibrated in the freedom of freedom rons sleep had been quick like the rush of posthypnotic suggestions he dropped tashas hand slumped felt the wall give no it was the air and he fell faceforward across a table his heart silent in respect for truer vibrations the musicians stood the horn and probe drew up the shadows now from the audience a child climbed upon the chords of sound growing out of the circle of the womb searching with fingers and then with motive and as the volume of the music increasedpenetrating the thick callousness of the irishman twirling his stick outside of black fleshthe musicians walked off one by one linked to probes respectful nod at each and his quiet pronouncement of their names he mopped his face with a blue cloth whats the matter here step aside folks these people are unconscious look at their faces theyre dead dead what happened dead its true then its true
a people fighting for the opportunity to hold slaves forever who were more concerned about domination by the whites in all aspects of life than about justice who had hanged slaves indiscriminately on suspicion of intent to revolt who had surrendered to mob violence anyone suspected of antislavery such a people could not be expected to abide by the rules of war where people of color were concerned there were approximately of these men in the union army including infantry seven cavalry and artillery regiments and in the navy it is important to remember that they were of four origins free men from the northern states slaves from the conquered areas of the rebellion fugitive slaves and slaves from the loyal states who had joined the army with or without the consent of their masters louisiana kentucky and tennessee furnished nearly onethird of the total number the free men were citizens of their states and of the united states and some of them were veterans or sons or grandsons of veterans of the revolution and war of the slaves from conquered areas were wards of the government known as contrabands under the confiscation acts the fugitive slaves were free after the emancipation proclamation both contrabands and fugitives were free by military force therefore by due process of law if their owners had been killed in armed resistance to the government that too was by due process of law these men of color had been caught between the fury of rebellious masters and the solid legions of loyal men they had died of disease neglect and hunger they had hidden in the canebrakes the swamps and the hills away from the passions of those who sought to drive them back to ruin they never were safe they never were free until courageous men like general hunter on the sea islands and butler in new orleans and thomas in the lower mississippi valley compelled rebels and prejudiced loyalists alike to respect them as men by putting rifles in their hands then their own courage put the seal of a great government upon their citizenship let us never forget that the condition of the fugitives who came in a great wave toward the union army was appalling if there were nothing else in the way of evidence the testimony of honorable men on that point would damn the institution of slavery completely the fugitives were broken in spirit some came alone some brought their families few had any sort of possessions their souls cried out against centuries of oppression they had been able to see but dimly beyond the limited horizon of the old plantation area they now came through the heart of a rugged and beautiful timberland where are the headwaters of rivers that flow to the sea where men learn the cruelty as well as the beauty of natural law where they feel the full force and meaning of life and must choose their own destiny here they discovered the overpowering majesty of the mountains the rustle of trees in the ancient forests the wild animals that roamed in the hinterlands for the first time many of them could stand erect and say i am a man their longings increased their horizons broadened but their fears deepened with every step they took for on every mountain path behind every tree in every shadow lurked death or cruel retribution their only hope was to reach the protection of the union armies the influx forced establishment of refugee camps around the perimeter of the battle area grant put the refugees to work harvesting cotton and used the profits to provide food medical care and clothing the army used them as laborers but it needed help and that help was not slow in coming christian benevolence had its roots down deep in america the men and women of the s who had dedicated their lives to organized benevolence had served well both their country and their god thousands now entered the portals which had been opened by the army into the vast arena of social reconstruction here was confusion and much work to be done and it was done by the combined efforts of the army and the benevolent societies with the blessing of the civil government they went straight to the heart of the problem there were men women and children many of them aged infirm and sick they had to be cared for as rapidly as the narrowing limits of the rebellion released them their only present source of sustenance was charity their only hope over the long view was education so there came into being in the towns and on the plantations from which owners or workers or both had fled training schools for labor and for life hospitals and workshops the purpose was to enrich the nation spare it the burden of a permanent drain upon charity and alleviate the disastrous consequences of the rebellion it was the chaplains under the inspiring leadership of john eaton of the twentyseventh ohio infantry volunteers in grants army a native of new hampshire and former superintendent of schools in toledo who took over the job of education and it was the army officers and privates who performed a noble but unrecorded service on a man to man basis after benevolent societies provided the money and the teachers for the schools the army furnished subsistence and transportation the benevolent societies furnished clothing books and other educational materials organizations most active in this work were the american missionary society the new england freedmans aid society of boston the freedmans relief association of new york the western sanitary commission of st louis the northwest freedmans aid commission of chicago and the western freedmans aid commission of cincinnati these organizations had in operation at the close of the war when the freedmans bureau was established by congress approximately schools with teachers and pupils in schools and orphan asylums the work had been accomplished under difficulties almost insurmountable the white population in the entire area of occupation turned its energies to preventing a solution of the problem instead of helping only in nashville and st louis did they contribute to the support of the schools there were incessant raids by confederate cavalry particularly by wheeler and forrest and the farther freedmen were from the army the more difficult it was to maintain schools best results were achieved in the west in cities like vicksburg chattanooga and memphis and in the east in the seaports and coastal areas except for north carolina plantations were isolated plantation owners were a law unto themselvesnot much could be done in the way of learning when school hours had to be adjusted to a long day in the cotton field teachers were victims of hostility cruelty and disease many dying of yellow fever smallpox and plain lack of decent food and living quarters both teachers and pupils were abused subjected to acts of violence and kidnapped school buildings were defaced torn down and burned the attitude of men in rebellion toward all efforts to assist the transition of slaves to freedom and to aid in social reconstruction of the area was no different from their attitude toward people of color in uniform they used slaves everywhere in their labor battalions their war effort was based on slave labor they used some free persons of color in their enlisted units but in no case was there any promise of emancipation they considered all union men of color as in insurrection for which the penalty was death and all white officers of these men as guilty of inciting insurrection for which the penalty was death by the laws of all slave states governor john letcher of virginia demanded from general jackson the surrender of captured negro troops and their white officers to be tried under the same law as had been john brown general beauregard wanted to execute all abolition prisoners as he called them by the garrote everyone apparently spoke of a union uniform on a negro as an abolition uniform secretary of war seddon said with regard to the officers we ought never to be inconvenienced with such prisoners this was a general order of jefferson davis as early as november supported by act of the confederate congress after lincolns emancipation proclamation on christmas eve davis ordered all negro prisoners and officers turned over to the states the confederate congress changed the rules and may ordered negro troops to be turned over to the states and the officers to be executed after trial by army tribunals it was not generally enforced because of certain retaliation by the lincoln administration there was substituted for the death penalty a refusal to include soldiers of color in prisoner exchange this led to a complete breakdown of the exchange system more importantly however the slaughtering of negro soldiers instead of taking them prisoners which had been going on from the beginning of the war was now intensified negro troops were not given the status of prisoners of war confederates murdered them at fort pillow in tennessee after they had surrendered they slipped in behind burnsides army and killed wagoners they killed them when union transports were captured on the cumberland river they bayoneted wounded men as they advanced to the attack at millikens bend they murdered prisoners at poison spring god alone knows how many helpless fugitives they murdered in the wake of shermans march to the sea they carried them away into slavery and they hanged them army correspondence makes very clear that the old practice of slave owners was continued of never making a record of punishments or cruelties it also makes certain that thousands of such cases occurred which can never be documented that continued after the war and down to the present time after the second battle of bull run lees army was in control of the battlefield and general pope was given permission to send men both to bury the union dead and to care for the wounded the men were sent on this mission of mercy but the negroes who drove the improvised ambulances and dug the graves were seized by the confederates and sold into slavery stonewall jackson carried away from harpers ferry all the negroes he could lay his hands on either lee knew about it or he was ignorant of what went on in his own army by january he was pleading that slaves be brought into the army as soldiers and two months later the government heeded his request but he had never been willing to exchange negro troops with grant and one wonders how many such prisoners of war his men actually had taken apparently the choice of murdering or selling into slavery was left pretty much to the soldiers involved the richmond enquirer said that should the union place negroes in the field none would be taken prisoner because the troops understood what to do in such cases it added that if any negroes had been captured as soldiers in the enemys ranks the newspaper knew nothing about it closely related to this problem is that of why confederate soldiers who robbed the union dead of their clothes at nightand by the thousandsand did not hesitate to take the clothing off wounded soldiers on the battlefield would not rob dead negro soldiers of their uniforms there was a specious argument in some southern newspapers to the effect that negroes had no right to wear the uniform and therefore it was not legitimately before the confederate soldier to be taken something of the character of these men is revealed by the behavior of forrest who operated with his brothers one of the most infamous slave trading establishments in the country was brutal in his treatment of negroes during the war and afterward yet was said to have had two wives one white and one black and two children by each it is revealed too by their turning union prisoners who were colored or were white citizens of southern states over to state authorities to be shot as traitors when everyone involved in the rebellion was a traitor to the united states union officers such as hunter butler sherman and others were con demned to death in absentia by the davis government by state governments and by field commanders the practice was almost as common as the earlier one of offering large sums for the delivery dead or alive of prominent antislavery leaders the interesting point is that no matter what the offenses charged against them may have been the broad base of the indictment in every case as it had been in every charge against antislavery men was incitement of slaves to insurrection the one thing that saved the captured officers of negro troops was the large pool of confederate officers in union prison camps and the certainty that rooney lee second son of robert e lee would be the first one executed in retaliation general hunter held the sons of many prominent slaveholders as hostages to make certain that his own men would not be executed if captured jefferson daviss rejoinder to the emancipation proclamation which gave freedom to the slaves was that it doomed several millions of an inferior race to extermination and that it incited them to general assassination of their masters by urging them to abstain from violence unless in necessary selfdefense if the english language means anything here was an open threat of extermination who was to do it except southerners and where but in the south there was more to this however than the claim that union soldiers of color were not engaged in war but in sedition davis and his cohorts were claiming a legal peaceful right of secession they demanded that it be recognized they claimed the right of their states to compel citizens of the united states to resist the federal authority they denied the right of citizens to obey federal authority in resistance to state authority subordination of the federal government and subordination of the colored people went together in and in the fact that negro troops had compiled a brilliant record during the war only served to intensify hatred by the southern whites in defeat make no mistake about the contribution of those regiments they fought brilliantly in a halfhundred important engagements nearly of the enlisted men lost their lives and won congressional medals of honor make no mistake either of the hatred of confederate veterans toward them it was impossible to keep an army in the south forever and the killing to beat the negro down never ceased even momentarily until congress got control of reconstruction away from president johnson negroes were killed raped and robbed from one end of the south to the other and no record was ever made of individual cases then the master terrorist of the slave country nathan bedford forrest the commercial slave trader of prewar days the murderer of union prisoners at fort pillowtook over and the whole south was honeycombed by organizations of many names but for convenience called the ku klux klan the klan has persisted to the present time it was an organized defiance of all law a government within a government without legal sanctions in its origins preaching hatred only of people of color seeking to destroy every vestige of hope for liberty justice and equality reversing the verdict of the battlefield negro citizenship for all practical purposes was transformed over night into a huge joke everything they had gained was stripped away every brutality ever visited upon their slave parents were revisited upon them the klan was organized lawlessness it was a fountain of hatred it was the impenetrable barrier to equality it was to the united states what the nazis were to germany it did not create hatred it took all of the hatred violence and oppression coming out of years of slavery and the rebellion consolidated it and nourished it through the years large parts of the south from that day to this have been under the rule of the klan it controls politics the police the courts the schools the churches the unions it represents systematized hatred of the negro the constitution and the government of the united states there is no dividing line between the violence of preklan days and klan days the thirteenth amendment became a part of the constitution december congress passed a civil_rights act over johnsons veto april less than one month later a bloody race riot occurred in memphis tennessee in which former confederate soldiers killed negro refugees and two white men burned homes schools and four churches in new orleans july they killed and wounded more schoolhouses were burned in tullahoma shelbyville gallatin athens knoxville and columbia books and equipment were destroyed with the buildings the worst of it was that the negroes were supporting these schools from their meager earnings and there was no way of restoring them early the following year the ku klux klan was organized and congress divided the area of rebellion into five military districts under an army of occupation it was little more than a skeleton force for administrative purposes having the numerical strength of an ordinary state police force it gave moral support to the reconstruction governments but was never strong enough to maintain order against the determined efforts of the klan waves of brutality murder and race riots swept across the black belt between the years and with the worst of the offenses in louisiana tennessee mississippi and south carolina new orleans opelousas vicksburg yazoo city and clinton were the scenes of downright massacres this was a veritable reign of terror with the klan whipping negroes murdering assaulting tarandfeathering schoolteachers burning the schools the churches and the homes where centered the activities which gave faith knowledge and selfrespect to the newly enfranchised negroes it did not arise from poverty of the whites but from opposition to education for the negroes to their participation in public affairs to their aspiration for equality driving out northern teachers did the job because there were no southern ones and the school system established by john eaton was broken up by lincolns hope for a change in the basic structure of southern life had failed even in the most progressive state the first to be restored to the union in july it was perfectly clear even by that time that the southern people were not going to look upon the negro any differently after than they had before unless it be with more scorn and contempt the concept of racialism was retained not that of the equality of men restraints were removed from the klan schools were segregated registration of whites and blacks was kept in separate books the federal civil_rights act was bitterly denounced and nullified wherever possible defeat was inherent in the reconstruction program because the government had no intention of occupying the south with military forces for a prolonged period a horrible wave of brutality sadism and anarchy swept over the people of color again as soon as the army was withdrawn and the reconstruction governments fell the federal authorities either could not or would not but certainly did not protect them they were helpless to defend themselves the state and local governments were apathetic even the civil war did not teach the people of the united states that the rights of men must rest upon something more substantial than prevailing sentiment in a given community that they must rest upon law and not upon sufferance upon the national conscience not upon local prejudice all of the inequities to which the people of color were subjected thereafter added up to an imperfect freedom derived from the will of the community and dependent upon toleration rather than right the history of the prewar antislavery contest of the war itself and of the postwar strife in the former slave states shows that where local government controls the affairs of men the rights of men depend not upon the spirit of the law but upon the caprice of their fellow men at any given time and that is precarious tenure indeed the idea that the degree of civil freedom belonging to any person can rightfully be fixed by popular sentiment is wrong local government will not protect in the case of minority groups or of persons it dislikes or regards as inferior or fears these are the people who most need the protection of law because they ordinarily do not have the wealth the education the family connections or any of the other intangible assets which safeguard the rights of so many against encroachment these were the freedmen at the close of the civil war state laws went right on allowing the white people to do what they had always done victims were only people of color and life was cheap the will of the community reinforced by the heavy hand of death denied them equality of public services and enjoyment of the amenities of life restricted their earning capacity controlled their lives by irresponsible private power and arbitrary police authority and permitted education for work only and that in moderation they continued to live in squalid shacks because they were not allowed to live elsewhere they were denied access to work commensurate with their ability being excluded from all but unskilled labor in the white mans economic world they served in our wars and came back to squalor and oppression they accepted it or starved or got out they were victims of economic discrimination political exclusion social rejection and inferior education it was not and is not a question of civil_rights it was unfinished business it was the survival of slavery in a land dedicated to freedom a colossal betrayal of the principles on which the nation was founded a continuation of the agelong struggle of men to be free of human rights versus slavery for control of the nation of democracy in all its radiance against privilege and arbitrary power the nation shrank from its full responsibility in and paid for its error with the lives of young men it did the same in and ushered in a century of paganism turned to anarchy the people of color had to be beaten down and they were beaten hanged burned mutilated and otherwise tortured this was the era of lynchingsthe same old formulathe same old methodthe same old objectiveboth on a grand scale and in a manner to attract the attention of the civilized world these lynchings were ofttimes great public attractions advertised in advance and attended by thousands of people between and there were in georgia in mississippi in texas in louisiana in florida in alabama and lesser numbers in other states to a total of this was anarchy a complete desecration of constitutional government it was government by men and not by law these mobs claimed to represent the will of their communities they had claimed as much both north and south before the war when they roamed the streets of the cities spreading death and destruction and we suppose in a sense they did because it is difficult to say who is most guilty the ignorant and depraved who perpetrate such crimes or those who know the enormity of the offenses but do nothing to prevent them every person who ever committed an act of violence on a person of color is known or could have been known to law enforcement agencies a high percentage of those lynched both men and women were innocent of all wrong the objective was to beat the people of color down by fear many were lynched for such offenses as trying to act like a white man seeking employment acting as strikebreakers using offensive language making boastful remarks many of the victims were framed by women for instance to cover their own indiscretions lynchings like the trials of slaves in earlier days quickly prevented any evidence being established any testimony being presented any possibility of acquittal the basis of mob action was always rumor and the death of the victim the only certain fact victims as of old were hunted with bloodhounds there was always an eagerness for the hunt that could produce a mob in a matter of minutes and a craving for the satisfaction of momentary power shown by mock trials and executions for one moment in their lives a few men could play god sheriff judge jury and executioner they would have chased their victims to hell and back if necessary for that and they did take them from officers of the law from jails from court rooms and from hospital beds mobs were frequently more interested in torture than in the killing itself victims were sometimes tied to trees or fence posts and used for target practice their toes and fingers were cut off one joint at a time their teeth were pulled out with pliers their testicles were crushed or cut off or burned off they were strangled they were roasted over slow fires their bodies after they were dead were soaked with gasoline and burned they were dragged by ropes behind trucks until the flesh was torn from their bodies women sometimes with babies in their arms and children went to these affairs mothers were known to have wakened their children to take them to lynchings thousands of people were involved law enforcement officials bowed to the will of these mobs and seldom would juries indict or convict the reasons for this roman orgy are not hard to find the africans were captured torn from their homeland and made beasts of burden in a distant land they were freed with a great deal of help from themselves given citizenship in the land of their humiliation and suffered from the gift of the ballot at the hands of their country as much as they had from the gift of their color at the hands of god more of them were shot down in the first twenty years of freedom than in years of slavery every step forward in knowledge and selfrespect hardened resistance all they ever wanted and asked for was an equal chance in the race of life a chance to be men it is a great tragedy that social reconstruction could not have been achieved in a respectable manner but the white people were drunk with power frenzied by the thought of interference and confirmed in the practice of evil deeds and doctrines for nearly a century that is a matter of history they would not have any part of it lawlessness in the former rebellious area to prevent it was appalling and to a large degree successful civil and political rights are still denied the people of color after a century of citizenship this concept of a white mans government grew stronger through the years the man of color who aspired to cast a ballot was dangerous he must be driven out or shot unless he renounced his rights as a man and a citizen we do not know how much weight to give to each of the several causes of this behavior but know with certainty what is involved and it is neither pleasant nor good from any point of view the first is a determination to keep an outmoded undemocratic even vicious political system which gives to the dominant whites complete control of local governments tremendous influence in political parties and the power to keep congress from passing laws for the benefit or protection of the people of color it gives white men in the old slave states with the lowest cultural level in the nation a great deal more power than anyone else in government they had it because they were slaveholders they have it because they oppress people of color and keep them from voting hatred has smothered the law it is the controlling factor the white people did not intend that the freedmen ever should make decisions or participate in public affairs not if they had to go to the brink of racial war to prevent it the second cause of oppression is a measure of personal happiness inequality seems at times to be nearer peoples heart than liberty itself there are millions who walk away from those who weep from those who are bowed down by heavy burdens from those who are lost in the storm and have nowhere to turn because they are despised they measure their happiness by someone elses misery their riches by someone elses poverty their intelligence by someone elses ignorance it seems paradoxical that such a large part of our personal satisfaction comes not from the richness of our own spiritual and material possessions but from the poverty of our neighbors not more than onethird of the white population of the slave states had any direct connection with slavery it kept the slave states poor it put a stigma upon labor it prevented the establishment of schools it drove the poor man out or up into the back country but the nonslaveholding population did nothing about it and one of the reasons was because they could look about them and see this large population of slaves so infinitely worse off than themselves the same held true after the civil war so long as they could keep the negro down they were content actually smug about their own ignorance poverty low level of culture and second rate achievements so the interests of the genteel politician and the redneck were joined people of color must never be allowed to make decisions or enter into the competition of achievement the white man had found his artificial badge of superiority in the paleness of his skin it was not man against man but one portion of the population against another the degree to which people of color insisted upon equality before the law was the measure of the degree of violence upon them trouble did not come from a recognition of equal rights but from their denial the third cause of oppression had to do with sex one can not dig very deep into the history of slavery or into the postwar era of race relations without being aware of its importance female slaves were fair game for any white man thousands were bought and sold for no other purpose and every place of public accommodation had its complement of female slaves to wait upon gentlemen guests slaveholders their sons overseers and apparently anyone else of mercurial temperament had a field day there was no one to whom the woman could appeal for protection without danger of terrible punishment the law provided no protection slaves were only property and rape was trespass the enormous amount of mixed blood forced back into the slave population was proof of their helplessness it was one of the reasons and a very powerful one for the fight to preserve slavery one very competent authority says that fifty per cent of the people of color in the southern cities in were of mixed blood the situation was no different after the war the grievances of these oppressed people were many and they are sickening but the one expressed with most vehemence and bitterness even today is the inability of the men to protect their women they were vulnerable to abuse by employers landlords and professional men of every sort complaint led only to heartaches at home resistance led to starvation and reprisal led to death it was the price an oppressed people had to pay for the poor privilege of staying alive white women hated the victims of their menfolk and it was the white women who would not accept association of the two groups except upon the basis of their own superiority equality was ruled out in the fourth place people are cruel and happily so they are more cruel to their fellow men than they are to animals the whites were unspeakably cruel to the slaves and they were equally so to the freedmen their victims had a will to resist which fed the flames of passion slaves were whipped and branded and castrated and starved by their owners and overseers whose will was law pregnant women were hunted with dogs and slaves who ran away were shot freedmen were whipped and castrated and hanged and burned and shot and set upon by dogs there was no one to protect them as slaves and there was no one to protect them as free persons why should a people who had learned to love brutal exhibitions give up its ready made pool of victims about whom no one was concerned finally there was the refusal of the old slave states to accept the verdict of the civil war the south always had been a land of stagnation and frustration and the negro was blamed for the whole of it the union was dedicated to freedom but the south was determined to keep slaves the union like the rest of the civilized world was moving toward free dom and equality for all men but the south chose to break up the union to preserve slavery it lost the war because its constitutional philosophy of decentralization could destroy but not create a nation it clung to the doctrine and to as much of slavery as it could salvage because it was the key to white supremacy the central theme of southern history is negro inferiority when historians continued to talk about slavery as a humane and benevolent institution and anthropologists about racial inequalities as an established scientific fact when the flag of rebellion was flown beside or above the stars and stripes in schoolrooms when men in public office shouted from the housetops their devotion to state sovereignty which never was when preachers and teachers and lawyers and newspaper editors demanded segregation foreverwhen all these things were true and the ku klux klan was allowed to flourish is there any wonder that people of color were beaten and shot and treated like dogs so were a people crucified three centuries of oppression three centuries of patient effort to attain full measure of freedom emancipation was something more than a formality it carried with it the human rights of men we failed to sustain those rights and freedom became a mockerywe pass then to a pattern of oppression much broader in scope segregation was renewed in all of its hateful forms some of which prevailed throughout the entire nation and grew worse through the years the person of color might have refuse scattered in his yard crosses burned before his home stones thrown through his window he might be shoved off the streets or abducted at night and severely beaten or have his house burned down he might be discharged from his job the bus might pass him by as he waited in vain for public transportation hospitals might refuse him admittance physicians and dentists might be always too busy to serve his needs banks might refuse him credit his neighbors might set up elaborate schemes to prevent him from buying or renting property in the community he might sit unserved in a public restaurant wait for hours to buy a pair of shoes or be tossed bodily out of a bar all of these things might happen and have happened a million times because the protection of persons and property is in the hands of local police officials they can be and are negligent in performance of their duty and brutal in their treatment of individuals who have done no wrong and they were invariably both where the person of color was concerned what could these people do when police officials would not protect and juries would not convict officials behaved like people wanted them to behave or they were not elected to office white people were protected against police brutality and illegal arrest because they were white people the people of color had no protection at all except the law and there was no one to make police officials obey the law they sat behind shuttered windows at night and none of them ever walked down a street with complete assurance of being able to get home again unmolested prejudice discrimination oppressioncall it what you willagainst our people of color is a form of social insanity it is destroying all of us whatever harms a part of society harms all of it it is destroying our government god himself gave color to man and from that color we have fashioned a single law that supersedes all constitutions and statutes the law of public opinion in a community it destroys equality when some people have to obey the orders of other people equality is extinguished the sure guaranty of peace and security of each race said justice john marshall harlan is the clear distinct unconditional recognition by our governments national and state of every right that inheres in civil freedom and of equality before the law of all citizens of the united states without regard to race we boast of freedom enjoyed by our people above all other people but it is difficult to reconcile that boast with a state of law which practically puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow citizens our equals before the law john marshall harlan had been a slaveholder he had been opposed to the thirteenth amendment but he had fought under thomas to preserve the union and constitutional government he believed in justice in equality of rights and in government by law civil_rights jf nr movement has reached ii a plateau from which can move n increasingly smaller circles toward piecemeal removal of barriers prohibiting status gains for negroeslunch counter and other public accommodation integration token employment and school integration and similar largely middleclass aimsor can begin to dig in for what appears to be years of exceedingly difficult work whose end result will be a realization of welfare gains for negroes and incidentally for other poor americans which will include elimination of poverty un and underemployment slums and substandard housing todays activists are often criticised for not having developed a master plan for achieving the latter or national social change and seems to operate best when considering local issues on a local scale the difference between yesterdays scattered sitin demonstrations and todays grassroots organizational work with frankly political aims in rural and urban areas with high negro concentration is that the organizers of the latter intend to build a national movement not a coalition with leaders chosen from the top but a national association of local interest groups who realize more and more that the future of lowdnes county negroes is tied inescapably to the future of negroes in chicago and los angeles and that their common future is tied to americas acts in vietnam and the congo this national association does not suppose a third party but a second force which can hopefully unite on issues of common concern for common good against majority racist sentiment in america it does suppose that negro unity on political questions will increase and that organizations like the lowdnes county freedom organization will become the rule rather than the exception the corruption which exists in established city politics throughout the united states make independent politics a necessity for negroes coalitions with liberal whites may follow if negroes can come to them from a position of strength the coalitionists who dream of negrolaborpoor white alliances must realize that identity of interest alone does not build unity and that differences between the interests of poor negroes and relatively wealthy bluecollar unionized workers are plain and are apt to be devisive the difficulty of eliminating the racism which causes white unity and white powermust be met by some arm of the civil_rights movement in the near future partisan politics must be avoided by negroes unless no other alternative presents itself those who urge reforming the democratic party from within must be aware that joining often means becoming and therefore deadens the reformers zeal when he must reform himself political education of the masses is a must for any sort of politically inspired gains it is regrettable that fewif anynegro political units the lowdnes county freedom organization is a notable exception concentrate on any more than registration deadlines and election turnouts political decisions are made yearround and leaders and followers must have yearround knowledge and vigilance to insure their rights are being protected the new movement must initiate actions and programs of its own while supporting those measures which will benefit their own community and the community as a whole it must be an action movement and not a reaction movement finally negroes must strive for negro representation of negro constituencies but not just color for colors sake but simply because few white politicians are willing or eager or capable of fairly representing predominately negro units since white voters will not vote for negro politicians negroes must use their unity in negro minority situations to force the white majority to elect their candidate in exchange for negro support for a goal desired by the white community the organizations being built today in hayneville alabama on philadelphias west side throughout mississippi and in watts must form a connection which allows independent action to meet local needs but demands concerted drives toward goals desired by all finally the movement must broaden its scope and its vision of itself and its condition it must connect vietnam and watts poverty here with escalation there the right to dissent with mounting pressures for consensus politics and realize that national barriers can act as fences to hold everyones freedom in when these are breached when our concern becomes the worlds concern and their concern ours we will have made a giant step toward a really great international society she most essential question confronting me is the psychological and physical survival of the black man in america i believe that it is impossible for me to separate myself from the collective survival of my people most of our problems whether we wish to accept this or not are group problems further they are basically the results of centuries of a unique kind of oppression the only salvation for us therefore is to translate our individual problems into group problems and then as a group proceed to eliminate them we must survive as a people not as a collection of assimilated freaksrootless and faceless as a writer and social activist i believe it is necessary therefore to address my art ideas and actions to the collective needs of my people it is my duty to trans ditions which our people face into form the oppressive objective con something more compatible with our physical and spiritual needs it is my duty also to help my people destroy the slave mentality which affects us all it is my duty to listen to the voice of my people to learn from them and to dedicate my life to total liberation of us all it is my duty to protect myself and my people from the enemy within as well as without i feel that there is no higher duty that a black man can perform in this society considering the condition his people find themselves in we must seek the total liberation of black people from all aspects of their oppression we must remember that our current ideas are the products of a particular kind of history a history which began when my forefathers were sold into slavery that our lives have been influenced by people like malcolm_x the writings of garvey du bois monroe trotter claude mckay and frederick douglass i would like to believe that i am an extension of these forces that i am motivated by the spirit of the nat turners the denmark veseys and a friend named herbie johnson who died from an o d when he was seventeen and by millions upon millions of unknown black people who slaved to survive like my parents did so that one day their sons and daughters would rise up take control and reclaim their manhood currently i am greatly motivated by the ideas of writers and thinkers like frantz fanon charles fuller bill davis rolland snellings and the theoretical writings of harold cruse and max stanford le roi jones writings on music and his play black mass have recently provided meaningful insights into the spiritual nature of black people there are so many excellent and relevant black writers and creative artists there is a writer in philly named james stewart who under better social conditions would be recognized as a writer of great depth and intensity of course there are also colleagues like dan watts editor of liberator and social activists and writers like ted wilson and eddie ellis all of these writers have one thing in common and that is a consummate desire to see black people liberated by any means necessary they are willing to sacrifice everything they have to accomplish these ends and this is finallyit must bemore important than any single creative or artistic trait that they may have for finally our art will be judged in terms of its relevancy to the age that produced us and the degree to which we were willing to extend it into reality in the end nothing else will matter whether it was aesthetically perfect or artful or if it lacked craft others after us will ask did it help liberate us what are the crucial issues of our times for us as i have already stated it is survival and the nature of that survival further can we survive as long as the white man dominates the world with his idea of what the world should be i believe we can not therefore we must understand that in order for us to survive we must come together as a people organize to confront the western white man on all levels of conflict we must look at this struggle from the perspective of what fanon calls the third world that is internationally in terms of the developing nations of africa asia and latin america we must see ourselves as the extension of that third world situated in the bosom of the beast in doing this we must assign ourselves the task of developing a new humanism so that we may ultimately create a synthesis of the best that mankind has to offer and thereby move to alter the existing power relationships then and then only is there hope for our children then and then only will we understand what manhood is it is not about what moynihan and other white sociologists say it is it is not about assimilating into a dying society totally lacking in spiritual substance it must be about something much deeper something much more pertinent to the overall needs of black people and if blood must flow so that our black spirit can prevail then damn it let it flow otherwise look forward to a bland existence in the wilderness of white america look forward to the pervasive mediocrity of western society inundating us and the entire nonwhite world these are harsh realities they are not intended to soothe but to create conflict meaningful conflict among a people who have generally been in a semihypnotic state currently the question of black_power occupies the center of our lives it must continue to do so everything that i have spoken about must ultimately be dealt with in terms of powerphysical psychological and spiritual black people are being asked very concrete questions about the political structure of america it is becoming clear that neither the democrats nor the republicans offer any meaningful solutions to our problems black people must have their own political structure in which to determine their own destiny the future of peoples of african descent living in america is dependent upon the degree to which these and other salient realities are understood and accepted we must give our total selves to the struggle to achieve our human rights and finally it is in struggle that we will learn who we are the many problems rj personal or otherwise which preoccupy me l today revolve around the readiness and preparedness of my new breed generation to replace its elders in racial leadership my concern is primarily within the areas of values overall maturity and last but not least ideological clarity too oftenin many nations im afraiddo young intellectuals and activists satisfy themselves with oversimplified solutions to vastly complicated problems which involve the destinies of countless peoples i emphasize this because until recently i had been guilty of these mistakes in the current africanamerican freedom struggle we are witnessing the epic rise of a people to national consciousness identity and selfrespect along with concrete historically justified aspirations for selfdetermination needless to say this movement will not wait for moderation or gradual methods of social change slogans are often strategic and necessarya psychic tonicif and when they reflect the spiritual desires of the oppressed but slogans alone are not enough neither is onesided dogmatic thinking we must constantly remind ourselves that our generation has been extremely fortunate to come into its own in this historic era our slave and freedman ancestors wouldve given their right arms to be in our shoes and we must act with the awareness that the decisions we make as leaders will affect the lives of our peopleand perhaps the worldfor years to come if we guided by nihilistic dogmamerely sloganize and postulate while neglecting the organization political cultural and economic of our peoplebacking up our slogansthen we will have failed our people and future generations it is dramatic and stimulating mounting the tribune above the crowd and screaming defiance at our oppressors amid encouraging shouts and approving cheers but it is ever so much more difficult to engage in the backbreaking labor of organizing ourselves and our brothers into the institutions which will provide the programs to guide us to selfdetermination too often we get lost in adulation and other egosicknesses forgetting that its not ones image or reputation but ones deeds which are instrumental in creating the final victory or tragic defeat within the general framework of organization lies the area of mental or philosophical organizationideology within the struggle within the ranks of the youth we have a diversity of ideologies from mysticism bordering on racism to maoism fanonism garveyism etc and some positive synthesis must be developed which will unify this babel of theories into one invincible africanamericanism geared to victory also theres the question of positive revolutionary standards and values i would warn our people that many opportunists are screaming black and brother and sister today this is now the hip thing we must develop positive values within the movement so that any demogogue who yells down with whitey is not mistaken for a black leader only positive standards and revolutionary values can arm our people against opportunism in all of its forms if a socalled militant doesnt live eat and sleep like the people then he bears watching if the brothers and sisters on the block in the bars poolrooms beauty parlors and barbershops dont know usas the sncc militants are knownthen were not doing our jobs we can romanticize about magic new culture etc but material progress for our broad masses will do more spirituallyand culturallythan a thousand witch chants an afroamerican peoples council composed of grassroots delegates dealing with concrete rural and ghetto problems is worth more than a thousand semibourgeois coffee and fashion shops a national afroamerican congress led by popular elementsis worth more than a million adulatory photographsgiant sizein militant black publications this is not meant to deny the positive values of our african and afroamerican cultural movement our music history art etc but it is merely a question of emphasis frantz fanon among others has written that colonial peoples are remaking their cultures when they are in the streets fighting for freedom also there are certain elements who would substitute culture for concrete work with the people so we have much work to do in all areas in the coming months and yearsand much personal growing however i am optimistic i have faith in our people and in our youth luckily we have the inspiring writings and deeds of the great men and women who have shaken the oppressive orders of the twentieth century the warriors thinkers and prophets of the wretched of the earth from preworld war europe to the current tricontinental revolution we have examples of courageous writers and thinkers men and women who trod the awesome path to victory or death du bois garvey padmore lenin trotsky mao fanon guevara nkrumahto mention a few and their works are available to those of us who would study the past in order to define the present and chart the course to the future what we as afroamericans must understand is that this is not a new battle that we fight it has been continuously fought since the first group of people were enslaved against their wills if we and our generation do not succeed it will continue until certain people realize that as long as a few have while the worlds peoples have not the earth will be unfit for human habitationyes the haves and the have nots when our generation speaks it is the tongue the voice of the wretched of the earth within this land black_power freedom now malcolm lives burn baby burn these are the battlecries of a nation in chainsthe shouts of defiance affirming justice and the rights of man we embody the primary issues now facing humanity whether the worlds peoples will be allowed to determine their own destinies or be policed by selfappointed emperors bent upon destructionby bomb gun or gas whether the worlds wealth will be equally shared among the masses of men or hoarded by a selfish few whether the worlds affairs will be governed by the opinions of the masses of peoplesdemocraticallyor by those of a few monopolies oligarchies or power elites we young men and women we new breed afroamericans are not really a phenomenon one sees us in the hard eyes of latin students revolting against the latest caudillo backed by the gringo empire our hands grip the rifles of asian youth dedicated to freeing and uniting their countries trampling down the palaces of miniature hitlers our hearts beat amid the vibrant passion of the youth of congo mozambique tanzania and dishonored ghana we are the newnew men and women with new visions of human destiny as for the africanamerican future i can only repeat that much of it rests upon our untried shoulders we must honestly labor and strive to prepare ourselves for the herculean tasks that lie ahead the broad masses of our people long suppressed are now stirring to life never to sleep again we have provided the slogans that shook the collective psyche kindling the flames of hope within our national heart this is a beginning the great africanamerican people are now assuming their collective personality a nation is emerging upon the stage of history woe to those who distort its aims or trample upon its dreams but we must also recognize the depths of our situation that our problems are inextricably linked to those of the american republic and through it to the world this latter problem will require all of our broadvisioned maturity and courage if it is to be solved we must take a full and careful look at the white americansstudy them as they have studied us we must realize that they are not one vast monolithic whitey but are composed of various ethnic groupings nationalities classesprogressives reactionaries liberals idealists etc we must encourage dialogue as brother malcolm did in his later years as the black_power paper says teach whites their roles encourage those who are sincere to repudiate their latent native racism developed systematically within them through the centuries by one of the most vicious systems known to man so that they can rise to our humanistic level this does not mean that we will become toms or lose our black consciousness it means that we must take the lead for the first time in history in restoring humanism to this republic for to be black or africanamerican in these times in this land is to be the bearers of light and human spirituality among a people wretchedly starved and dying for lack of inner essence and spiritual truth we wouldnt change we would still be black brothers and sistersmore so and deeper because we would function as a spiritualas well as political and socialvanguard of the future if we succeed if we can accomplish these tasks i see a total restructuring of american society into a true haven for democracy the longawaited american revolution i see a place of honor for the africanamerican nation among the councils of humanity if we fail i see utter destruction a colonial race wararmageddonwhich will despoil this republic making the fall of rome resemble a picnic destroying the majority of its people along with their great creative potential however again i am optimistic i believe that we have it within us to accomplish these tasksprovided we properly prepare ourselves the past was dark the night is long but we bring the sunrise the most pervasive nr y trend for todays i r young black intellects i uals is their vigor and degree of selfconsciousness about being black the dynamics of american assimilation have backfired and given rise to an unintended revolution black people have an increased sensitivity in reacting to the institutionalized nature of bigotry and are developing a more positive regard for black culture and community for the older black generation this has meant an escalation of the traditional pattern of negotiating for progressive changes while for young blacks the revolution means reconstituting the basic processes of u s life as they affect black people only by grasping this central theme is it possible to understand the brooding anger hostility and danger of black attitudes and actions these generalizations are based on a rapidly growing number of actions being undertaken by black people to combat racism such as legal changes sought by the naacp militant resistance as displayed by robert williams mass marches and negotiations as directed by sclc and northern urban riotrebellions rather than attempt an analysis of some collection of these actions and in so doing spell out how i agree and disagree with aspects of each i will offer a sample of pointed personal reflections as evidence for such generalizations in other words by pointing out which people i feel are sayingdoing significant things and outlining some issues of considerable importance hopefully the general theme will be made more concrete the two men most clearly embodying the essential character of the black intellectual rebellious freedom courageous integrity wisdom and social consciousness are malcolm_x and w e b du bois malcolm_x presented black manhood as a possibility not via the normal whiteorientated status channels but by emerging from the black community he possessed a style of life and rhetoric around which a movement of decisive proportions could have been assembled his published autobiography is a modern classic destined to supplant up from slavery which is still quite in demand as the negro life study to become familiar with his life shows at least three reactions to the american scene he was a nigger of the ghetto with little hope of escaping crime and a life of fear after becoming a muslim malcolm emerged as the spokesman for a position of total black alienation from american whites malcolm grew in stature he then began developing a view which focused on the problems appreciating the problematic nature of whites and heading toward a more differentiated dynamic view of american society this latter development in the thought of malcolm_x presents a challenge for someone to continue it while already constituting a fresh perspective from which to program a new black selfconsciousness du bois is the one outstanding black intellectualactivist who continued trying to promote changes in the american society without compromising the interests of black people he joined an unrelenting scientific career with a spirit of communalism for the folk culture of black people the regrettable fact is not that we have lost him by death for his was a full and productive life but the popular misuse of his life and work by ideological groups of small significance and polite bourgeois blacks with short memories albert camus serviced all men by discussing the man who rebels the one who has the courage to say no by not being black he broadens the horizon and presents the possibility of an international revolutionary spirit but there are many who are in the process of creating who are still reaping the influence of such men as malcolm du bois and camus when summarizing the most relevant writers of today it would be important to cite the penetrating insights and critical precision of ralph ellison the cathartic quality of leroi jones expressive tragedy the brutal surrealistic truths of chester himes and the colorful poetic symbols of melvin tolson these men are creatively interpreting the black experience in american life the question of what these and other writers are saying must remain for reading them or their critics interpreting these writers must be a dynamic process because the blackwhite problem is so explosive and consequently in need of constant reevaluation nevertheless it is possible to undertake a general formulation of issues faced by them one major issue is the managed illusion and destructive impact of certain popular u s american concepts and norms an example of this is the blind worship of political citizenship a practice which falsely categorizes issues into foreign and domestic and at the same time denies existing sociopolitical categories of american life the consensus and conflicts of race religion nationality and social class are what dominate american life each of these is grounded in the peculiar development of american history but at the same time is linked to an international pattern of a similar nature the issue involves the need to face problems with a more concrete less naive view of social and political reality as an example the fact of poverty in india mississippi or haiti presents the same constellation of problems for which we must begin to think of the same programs for their solutions people are hungry the people are colored the land has been raped by corrupt and oppressive political regimes the same forces are at work promoting overt racism in rhodesia south africa angola mississippi watts and harlem and we cannot promote change unless we follow the advice of claude mckay and for their thousand blows deal one death blow and similarly the barbaric death game of the viet nam war a second major issue concerns the nature of the goals of the black community with the increased potential of technology and mechanical efficiency reigning as the supreme value black people must reassess and thereby reconstitute their values in light of this baldwin has rhetorically asked who wants to integrate into a burning house black people on the streets of many cities gave their answer with the rioters cry bum baby burn who can say perhaps there was no other way for those black people to express themselves and feel confident that they were heard however if we remain on this level the depth of the problem will cause everyone to burn the problem demands that we find and cultivate a basis on which to save ourselves and hopefully everybody in the midsts of antihuman values and antipeople institutions this leads us to the last major issue id like to discuss as every major social analyst has reported america is controlled and managed by power if this be true then a man or a people without power is a ward of those in power for possessing power makes one an autonomous agent from the immediate control of others with power people need power black people need black_power the central point is that the black community in order for black people to survive and develop a positive standard of life must develop social economic and political power autonomous from the immediate control by outside forces in addition to the obvious material results of such a development even the use of the term has meaning too long the images and concepts held by blacks have been projected in the interests of others the communications media made the term black_power into a fearsome cry a veritable war whoop well thats exactly what it is but the really frightening thing is that the war is not going to be a nat turner or mau mau affair the frightening thing is that nobody knows what its going to be like the dictums of a systematic ideology are no longer relevant the dictums must now come from hopefully serious dialogue between the intellectuals use of scientific knowledge and the experience of the people or the experience of the people will speak for itself ergo watts even in light of these and other problems i can turn to the future with some optimism this results from my faith in human beings to rebel and also from the degree of brotherhood i have experienced yes the future of black people must be understood with this in mind we an ever growing number of black intellectuals are committing our lives to the black community in hopes of surviving of everyone surviving our version of the national anthem is being wailed by such as john coltrane and archie shepp our soldiers are organizers for sncc and other such organizations our armageddon is fast approaching in sum as put by black poet laureate of harlem langston hughes o let america be america again the land that never has been yet and yet must be the land where every man is free the issue most crucial v to our times in amerj ii g ica is the struggle for human rights now being waged and most significantly in our streets the black mans struggle in america is but a part of the total picture viewing other places such as south africa reveals that the struggle against racism is the most crucial one facing the world today as a black man in america i can only address myself to the problems which directly affect me i dont think black men should place problems existing elsewhere ahead of the problems in america however much they might be related the only author who truly addressed himself to the problems of the twentieth century dr w e b du bois cut swiftly to the marrow of the problem with his prophecy that the problem of the century would be the color line most of the writers who have addressed themselves to the problem have merely echoed what du bois said early in this century unless there is total social change i foresee a bleak future for black people in america without total change negroes may expect to experience in the future what they are experiencing today that policemen are required to protect a few hundred black people who try to walk down a street as happened in chicago this summer is symbolic of what negroes are now experiencing for the great majority of negroes the future looks bleak both economically and socially the white man has everything going for him at this point and he is determined to preserve the status quo one can readily understand upon looking at the position the white man occupies in america today why he will not change unless he is forced to america today is a white mans country it was created for him and he has spent an enormous amount of time and energy maintaining this structure the lesson of slavery teaches us that the founding fathers turned their backs on the black man at the inception of this country and their example has been since followed the white man refuses to understand that black people simply want the rights white people enjoy they do not try to understand this because to do so would be admitting that they have wronged a people and they do not want to admit this fact or come to terms with their guilt the rights of black people to peaceably assemble are restricted in this country as a result of the hatred of whites thus black people who protest are reprimanded while white hecklers are tolerated while admitting that the cause of protesters is right and just the establishments in our cities use every legal means to restrict protest and in effect perpetuate the denial of the rights negroes are striving for the efforts of leaders such as dr martin_luther_king jr while most laudible seem doomed to failure you cant use a philosophy people do not accept in order to change people dr_kings belief is strong and sure the tragedy is that the majority of white americans do not accept his philosophy or share his dream about the brotherhood of man acts of hatred on the part of white northerners this summer unveiled a heretofore hidden beast the cries of chicagos mayor daley and other principals of the northern establishmentconsidering dr_king a meddling outsiderare not unlike the cries from the southland shades of wallace barnett eastland and company the black man is told that he can only do that which the white man approves for example black people are told to turn their backs on stokely carmichael because whites do not approve of what he says much of the truth in what carmichael is saying is completely glossed over by whites attempts to discredit carmichael are largely the result of white peoples fear of what they have interpreted his message to be though the white man goes to great lengths to prove that the negro cant achieve his goal without aid of the white man it is certain that most of what the black man has accomplished in america has been without the aid of all save a handful of whites the cry black_power has been heard while in essence it is true that an ethnic group should control the community where it is the majority it also is true that the negro must achieve his goals within the framework of the existing society the negro must join the american mainstream as a full citizen if american citizenship is the negros goal the negro cannot practice race hatred to exclude a man from participation in society on the basis of skin color whether white or blackno matter what name you give the exclusionis race hatred black_power has a beautiful ring and sound but we cant get hung up on slogans and allow the nicesounding things men say to mislead us so long as the white majority does not fully accept black politicians whatever power wielded by black politicians though controlled by and sensitive to the desires of the black community will remain second class power the black man cannot prevail in america as a separate entity he is too small a minority but to date the black man has never been a full citizen a part of the american mainstream with that thought in mind it naturally follows that white men must admit that black men have rights which whites have to respect disrespect for black men on the part of white men is responsible for most of the racial hangups in america the negro is not attempting to win and influence white people but instead is attempting to bring about complete social change in america this can be achieved without love but it cannot be achieved without respect most white people are totally opposed to the equality of negroes in this society the mere thought of negroes as their equal caused many white chicagoans to ban together this summer under a banner nazism thousands of americans died fighting against the white man must accept black men as equals for two very good reasons economic and social progress it is fast becoming economically unfeasible to maintain segregation in america increased technological competition between the worlds nations make folly of this system which wastes the talents and skills of millions of people the future of america is completely intertwined with the future of the negro in america if the negro does not become a citizen in the fullest sense this america may cease to exist to be sure there will be a nation here called america but it will not be the land conceived of in the american dream how unlike the poland of is the poland of today and the change occurred because poland refused to make the social changes that were needed to assure longevity for the peoples dreams as a nation america cant continue to exist with vast numbers of her nativeborn constantly seeking freedom unless the dynamic change which must take place occurs this america is doomed another may arise but this one will surely fall whenever honest discussion about the negro and his struggle takes place the red flag is waved by the bigots and the reactionaries it should be loudly shouted that communismnor any other ism is not the gravest threat confronting america today rather the greatest threat rests within her own shores the white mans problem his inability to accept the black man has for too long lingered without solution the racial problems confronting america today are more the white mans than the black mans the black man is merely asserting that he wants the same rights as the white man that he become a citizen in fact as well as in law the movement has radij t cally reoriented my i own conception of the p vocation i have chosen for to be a preacher is a strange and glorious but nonetheless terrifyingcalling in america at midcentury to preach gods word by tongue alone is not enough one must seek to unleash the creative energies which that word claims on its own merits by putting ones body where once he had cast his rhetoric it is in nathan scotts inimitable eloquence to dare test the spirits to see if they are of god for certain allwhite communities in the greater chicago area remind us of the bitter harvest sown in the deceptive employment of terminology about god rather than encounter with gods children on the multiple jericho roads which bisect the city and which are shifting the boundaries of its ghettos no preacher can ease by without knowing the issues of our time and the knowing is less a matter of literacy than of identification with those whose dispossession and basic powerlessness make them as they were in the days of isaiah micah and amosthe primary issues of the era affairs are certainly soul size it is for this reason that the men of literature who have struck chords of wintered discontent and yearlong searching in me are james baldwin particularly in nobody knows my name the fire next time notes of a native son albert camus his essay neither victims nor executioners the stranger and the plague joseph kafkas the trial lerone bennett especially striking was the negro mood before the mayflower and confrontation black and white thomas wolfes you cant go home again and the web and the rock and of course the anonymous poets who distilled from those mysteries wrapped in enigmas the great wisdom of ages and with gods inspiration created the holy bible man will be in eternal quest for his myths somewhere arthur miller another author who has reached me with peculiar force has written that we must stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and on the laurels of our ancestors lest we cheapen the myth by horatory tribute to the past indeed in our own parochial experience the appeal for black_power is the quest for an authentic myth to articulate a consciousness too long dormant in the ghettos of harlem cleveland los angeles and chicago for in the houghs and in the watts of our cities there too is a nation now in labor through the traumatic crisis and travail of its new birth of freedom we can not afford to abort that event for it rages against the dying of light in all men ours need not be a tragic era if we but live it outside platos cave and in the reflection of gods intent for man namely to live in communityand in truth chicago as a case j ir t study certain predicj ii j tions can be made on the future of the negro in america first o utmost importance is that negroes are locked in the central city the consequence of this fact is not only slums but a systematic institutionalized system of subjugation perhaps in ten years chicago negroes will be divided into three categories the cogs in the system or the supporters of the system basically these will be the educated negroes teaching in the poverty program and the high paid civil_rights leaders their subsistence is derived from supporting the system through hollow attempts to rehabilitate lower income negroes lower income negroes in chicago have been colonized into a definite welfare section of the city largely encompassed by public housing the colony of negroes is supported by public assistance directed and guided by a large welfare bureaucracy as such they are told what to do where to go patrolled by armed guards and as indicated in the above paragraph are placed in a tug of war with the professional negro who derives his in come from giving them services there is a minute third category which is essentially black radicals composed of artists and activists if recent trends are any indication of what happens to this category then they are in a precarious position usually they are arrested for insurrection degraded or pushed off as absurdities there are reasons for this essentially the vested private interests in the ghetto are ostensibly the liberals in the northern city especially jewish interests in the ghetto they hobnob with civil_rights leaders support their activities openly and claim antisemitism when negroes attempt to force them out the radicals are a threat both to financial interests in the ghetto and to the service group of professional negroes the future of the negro in the united states really depends on the success of the minute third category the radical blacksor as courtland cox of sncc says those close to the community using what i here choose to call politicalcultural integration those close to the community will probably choose certain paths a develop a consciousness among negroes through cultural extensions which whites cannot interpret and which they fear such as music poetry art etc b using these cultural extensions as political avenues to organize all blacks into a formidable political base which is securely knotted by the trust in the consciousness of culture i choose to use the northern ghetto simply because the south is becoming highly urbanized and if the achievement of the politicscultural integration can occur in the north it can occur in the south or concomitantly if sncc can achieve the consciousness of blacks based on this type of integration in cities like atlanta then the knowledge can be utilized in the north the other alternative is complete takeover of the black ghetto in the north and through violent power forcing the federal government to deal directly both financially and politically with the black ghetto envisioning this process the takeover of one street instead of burning the stores and houses could perpetuate this process i mean forcing white merchants out of the ghetto thereby forcing them out of the civil_rights movement which in a few years will probably be atrophied i also envision the development of cooperatives by blacks and the rearrangement of land use patterns to accommodate new residential and commercial functions a black renewal and black planning process i dont think this is a figment of the imagination although it may sound like a novel what the world doesnt understand is that if stokely carmichael and the coterie of brains advising him in sncc or northern student movement nsm in detroit and philadelphia are ignored now then the efforts of the vested liberal interests in the ghetto and of the traditional civil_rights organizations will prove successful fifteenyearolds will be twenty in five years and they wont stand for liberalism or the welfare ghetto or phonies i am not merely parading the slogan of black_power but its time that negroes understood that a lilywhite suburb is white power not simply because the population is per cent white but because they have control of their zoning density and landuse patterns actually the planning of the ghetto by negroes induces shared power in the metropolitan area at the present the suburb is the mansion and the central city is the cotton field the analogy is useful since negroes are actually working to support the leisure class of the suburbs in the south they would kill the slave that didnt till the fields now when negroes say that they want to plan their communities it is called antisemitism or it is claimed that this will cause a white backlash after a riot when negroes rampage the streets and burn the exploitative stores cant people see that negroes dont want the stores that they would decide the functions of commercial interests in their neighborhoods are people trying to say that negroes dont know where to locate parks theaters and houses in their communities actually the bitterness arising between civil_rights groups concerning black_power is absurd sclcs and snccs home base atlanta has developed into an interesting idea of shared power in a metropolitan area obstensibly the west side of atlanta with the commercial interests of hunter street the shaded homes and the educated negroes is nothing less than black_power within a community inducing shared power in the city the intensity of negro culture that greets you on hunter street in atlanta is a landmark of what negroes can do here you can hear horace silver ramsey lewis perhaps hear leroi jones read poetry in a coffee shop all in a black community why should negroes prefer to move into an allwhite community and listen to the beatles undoubtedly as far as i am concerned black people will have to build rehabilitate and plan within the ghetto simply the other alternative of asking and inducing the middleincome negro to leave the central city and move into the suburbs not only destroys the cultural patterns that are beautiful and significant to the negro but it is asking him to give up his right to determine what is best within his own race i am wrapped up in the idea of being black as i see it the only way that the three groups of negroes previously mentioned here do not develop is that black people plan their communities from churches to chicken shacks whether america wants to admit it or not this is what negroes are going to want my little sister already knows what it means to be black at and she accepts it if because i know that my sister cant be deceived by liberalism or her friends and i want to see her live and enjoy being black means that i support black_power then i do no negro can afford the deceptions of liberalism and technological progress the only way black people can participate in these changes is the utilization of progressive methods in their own communities a real question that we a f have to deal with is i whether or not black people can act to end racism within the framework of america if not and i think not how do we get them out of that framework that is to ask where do we look to for strength and when asking that become sharply aware that there is no sense of a positive history in the black community only the negative history of being oppressed by the white man it seems to me that our work is to meet that problem with the people we work with and to help deal with it in terms of program i suspect that we will not be able to do much more than lay the foundation for the kind of struggle that black people will have to wage but we can begin to educate the people we work with to their history and i dont mean the history of the white man rather the history of nonwhite people and their role in the stream of world history i accept africa as the cradle of civilization and have to translate this fact to the people in lowndes county alabama in helping them get over the negativeness theyve been taught to feel about being black black people in this country who for so long have been told that they are only per cent of this countrys population will have to see themselves as not independent of the nonwhites in south africa or in guatemala we can no longer consider ourselves part of the united states except as struggling colonial subjects the land of our birth is africa we join with the worldwide black belt in its struggle against white american oppression it is certain that nonwhites within the boundaries of the united states will be doing different things than nonwhites in other places but we have to develop a sense of working together in the same thing or against the same thing that is while were doing different things see ourselves as not independent of each other what this lays out for logical progress the only way black people can participate in these changes is the utilization of progressive methods in their own communities continued from page black people in lowndes county or harlem or greenville mississippi is that what they build they have to control we cannot do that within the context of building a better america which is to say building for america and thats the heart of why sncc has to move towards blackness for us to talk about blackness is to talk about where we can find the basis of building within the framework of a concept of justice towards a civilized society it cannot be found in white americaat least by black people certainly black people are not above wanting decent medical care shelter food clothing even luxuries those things are not in and of themselves bad but america can only give us these things at the cost of our humanity and then it can only give us a barely adequate amount integration into america cannot give us dignity and humanity for it ignores the fact that the society we allegedly can integrate into has always depended on the negation of black people as human beings this fact alone exposes the lie that its possible for black people as a roup to integrate into america for the humanity of white people depends upon the destruction of the foundation of white supremacy this is not to say that sncc organizes around hatred of whites hatred of whites is a legitimate reaction among black people and im not going to put it down james baldwin once wrote that the aware black man is in a state of perpetual rage but sncc emphasizes that being black is not negative and that black people must understand what america has done to black people if we talk about white america about what it is in fact we can get black people to understand that there is no freedom in becoming a part of america the contradiction becomes even clearer when black people understand what they are in fact if that gets translated by white people as organizing hatred of white folks then thats white folks problem thats an expression of white guilt and a demonstration of the fact that white people are not ignorant of what they have done there will be hatred there is hatredthere are many reasons for nonwhites to hate white people there will be violence exposing the truth about what white america has done to us not only in this country but around the world could lead to indiscriminate violence or discriminate in that its directed at white oppression as artist my major problem is to do some of the same things that lsd is doingblowkeanrssm ing minds expanding consciousness black consciousness as a black artist i am working toward reversing the value orientation of the black man in america that decadent value system imposed upon him by whites i believe this can be done in several ways but one manner in which i am participating is by giving the black man a literature of his own a literature with those oppressive values of the dominate american culture diminished to the minimum the american society denies the black man a recognition of existence it dehumanizes him so a literature with black symbols relacing white symbols is needed a literature with newly created black myths and a reestablishment of positive folkways must evolve from the experiences of black artists who have sprung from the people we artists must create a literature with its own band of fantastic black heroes through literature theater and art the revolutionizing of the consciousness of the black people can be achieved as well as establishing channels of black mass communications in giving the black man his own values this aids in combating the white cultures domination our peoples sense of reality has always been distorted by definitions by whites and this must be halted i do not want a black art that is an offshoot of white art or culture or a darker reflection of the white mans hated society a completely mutated and revolutionary form of black aesthetics is needed to foster new ways of thinking and to release the pentup feelings which is the heritage of the sensitive black man black art must go against be against white psychology philosophy and aesthetics black art and ideas should spring from the black masses and should be communicated to the black masses the problem that threatens the black artist is not to become a better artist in the sense of bourgeois white america but to become something different to take on a new identity for the sake of his people perhaps the black artist should think in the ancient tribal patterns in the terms of his people as tribal units and he being the shaman sorcerer medicine man or witch doctor the hereditary relator of tribal myths tales history and wisdom one of my most pressing problems as an alleged activist would be the effectiveness of my program northern california has not gone up in flames it is questionable whether black_power is so imminent a threat in san francisco that it covers the white power structure many of the old civil_rights activists of core and sncc have sold out or are playing house niggers for some unexplained reason to the war on poverty program so to the white man the natives appear happy with their bright new beads and baubles but perhaps this is some kind of ultra sophisticated strategy or ruse and not what it appears as handkerchief headin as a revolutionary activist my major problems are partial failure and delay in northern california we are behind the leaders of the dormant civil_rights movement are sleek bourgeoisies indulged by liberal whites and on the payroll of the establishment here it seems so easy to integrate it is so very easy to get a white girl so the leaders have kept everything cool this is not an excuse on my part that nobody seems to be listening to the revolutionaries even while black men are still being forcibly abducted for that racist war on brown peoples in that land that hardly any of us had heard of before uncle sam decided it would be a good jumping off place into china the oakland police are the same arrogant beasts who protect the rights of whites and abuse the black man in his own neighborhoods they have not been put on the run up here even once so one of the more pressing problems that the black revolution seems little other than a paper tiger in my locale but perhaps i am wrong certainly i know the solution to this problem black unityblack unity for black_power to confront the man are you influenced in your personal outlook by the philosophies of any other writers or thinkers yes but not always consciously to say who had or has exactly the most influence is impossible this is due partly i suspect because living in america i was greatly influenced in my formative years by white writers that i now despise or resent for reasons of their active approval of this racist society so by attempting to reject much of this early conditioning i am constantly searching for new truths and am prone to destroy my new gods rapidly i read richard wright very early and was consciously and unconsciously influenced in my creative life kafka a sad spectre of an alien culture a hero of estrangement a prophet of dying europe was an influence for i did not know myself then this was before i found the beauty and value of my own people with their heritage and history the world that richard wright depicted horrified me at first and i refused to believe in what he spoke of through his art though my eyes told me that he was a man of truth in my childhood and adolescence life was something that happened only to me and books art and movies were something outside life i refused for a long time to put them together and i did at one time accept the american dream of which her writers so gloriously spoke i was in fact at one time a house nigger and it was mainly through reading that i came to view myself in this despicable role george orwell e franklin frazier chester himes and franz fanon have had extreme influence in my development as a black man malcolm_x above all the toilet by leroi jones and whos afraid of virginia woolf by edward albee have had the most recent affect upon me as a dramatist one was created by a black man of truth showing the reality that he knows is a black american reality that many of his brothers share and the other by a white prophet of americas hypocrisy who portrays the degeneracy of his own society a man who hates his own nearly as much as any outsider can being in the middle of this century and so near the beginning of my work i can not say candidly which writers are exerting the most influence upon me but surely they must be those whose work i am learning from whose work i use as some measure to my creation surely these writers are in the main black for this must be if i am to one day be and think completely black of course there is leroi jones but there is also lawrence neal marvin jacknon and welton smith to name a few who are the contemporary writersthat is writers of this centurywho you feel address themselves to the key issues of the times this question seems so broad if i started from the beginning of the century i could get hungup and write a book it is more of a theme than a question to narrow it down ill only mention some few in my time with reservations i include the white proletariat writers of the thirties for i believe that they thought of the black man more in terms of a social abstraction and their manifest good attitudes toward pertinent issues came from political ideology not human motives the absurdist playwrights who are actually old men save for albee who ill include in this category though perhaps i shouldnt but lately have come into prominence i include men like beckett ionesco genet etc though i believe they would resent being listed with those concerned with issues especially social or political issues in their demonstrating the futility and absurdity of mans existence they mirrored the spiritual annihilation of their dying culture so their plays of human issues forecast the relevance of social and political issues today for a new culture is about to sweep aside theirs and the offsprings of that society today in my time i was at first anxious over the progress of baldwin now i only feel quiet hostility after suspecting that baldwin isnt writing for me or to me i keep reading ellison again and again more because i love good art and w the craft of excellent writing and jones has just found himself and his direction as have many of us and though we black writers are not thrashing the same blind and dead horses it is too soon yet to place bets on the real contenders entire schools of black writers are springing up and these are the people addressing themselves to the times in which i am concerned all of the white writers today seem to be ominously quiet list those issues crucial to our times and comment on them the single paramount issue for the black man today is the survival of black people there are too many people in this world the white man knows this the white man can no longer economically exploit the nonwhite peoples any longer he has no need to he has cybernetics the black peoples will soon be systematically exterminated unless they unite they will go the way of the buffalo and the indian what kind of future do you envision for the negroes in america please state why you feel as you do unless drastic changes are made in the next decade i see only death for the black peoples in america and soon following the world unless the black man in america unites he will be given concentration camps instead of integration the relocation centers might be given the euphorism of retaining or retraining camps or such to ease the fears of those whitewashed collegeeducated negroes who would hesitate to enter the fake shower rooms with their phony bars of soap i foresee black babies sterilized at birth in the white hospitals of white america i foresee blacks being assigned the status of public american enemy supreme i see death for blacks at the hands of whites here in america america has already initiated a racial war upon foreign soil and america cannot continue to have so many dark witnesses and dissidents within its house in the coming years there will be parallel revolutions here in america the revolution among the whites will come when the pronounced fascists push to the fore to save capitalism which they realize is in its last and deadliest battle socalled liberal whites and whites of goodwill will be probably shot wholesale by the fascists even before the black man can eliminate these anchors about his neck and then white america will begin the extermination of the black man and in the immediate future there will be revolutions among the black as the black peoples liquidate their socalled leaders who fraternize with and sell them out to the whites when the moderates or liberal negroes are eliminatedthen the black people can find the selfdetermination to fight against the whites the people must and will fight for their own survival and destiny blacks need power to survive and it has to be gotten in other ways than civil_rights bills and wars on poverty it must be taken through strife let me make this clear l g i aint a writer i aint even a thinker i do sp end most of my time considering what the young intellectuals and wise old philosophers are saying in an attempt to make a decision about the right direction for me i am a social worker and being of an existential orientation my decision about direction must not only apply to little old black professional spinster me but to all the little children who come to my neighborhood house as well as the welfare mothers the members of the womens clubs and the teenage drop outs with babies bad marriages and always lots of doctor bills it seems that there are only three alternative goalscomplete annihilation enslavement or assimilation of white folks this is from a worldwide vantage point nationally if we are interested in survival weve got just one possible procedurethat is to become smoother sneakier more articulate toms and to teach our poorer less privileged brother to be less volitile less angry much much less emotionally spontaneous or is the word honest we must become the most adequate pleasing passive secondclass white folk we can be internationally if we american negroes endure the storm there may be a time when the options are ours as colored people to consider if it is at all reasonable in this era when morality is an issue of power to consider humanitarian goals to be valid then we must consider what it will mean in years after the next world war and the total destruction of civilization in the process to have to deal with a minority of vulnerable dependent whites lets face it there aint a negro alive who doesnt know an ofay he would like to save when the shooting starts the problem is that for some it might be a loving mother a secret but meaningful affair a decent boss i talked with a negro woman who lived years with a white woman and reared her daughter in the home the white woman hired a seamstress to make the childs clothes and babysit on the mothers dayoff im sure this good black woman can testify to the goodness of white folk both annihilation and enslavement would take a great toll on the moral fiber of the new society we are too accepting to start rejecting people in a total way we are lovers to the core our society must be built on love not christian love but jesus love black love is sexual aggressive demanding as well as giving tender and protective black love permits a fight but not a murder a lay but not hooking prostitution is a service for the middleclass white population it seems to me few negroes acculturated as such have ever needed to purchase sex our black_power has got to be our black love we must destroy white power with black love now lots of our performers and musicians have already found assimilation to be the best way it would appear that for the most part they are wishing for individualization right out of the negro race to the higher white side and thats not what we want then there is nothing more obnoxious than watching a black man fistfight in a bar for the purity of a white whore that is just wholesale purchase of one of the lies we must love a way that is conquering it must destroy value systems and myths and finally and maybe most important we must destroy races american negroes who are americas only melting pot wouldnt lose a thing but to suggest to the world that it rid itself of the concept of racial supremacy through complete amalgamation would be blasphemous we must not tell not a whisper but begin now before its too late the first step in the use of black love is to slap your white friend when he makes another stupid racist statement instead of becoming embarrassed and alienated the second step is to stop killing men especially other dark ones and the third step is the production of lots of brown babies and of course all will become automatic when we finally really dig love ourselves when you purchase life insurance you buy protection for aracj your family in the event of your premature death but more ww than this one fact you are also starting a valuable savings p rosam which is tax sheltered it is one savings program c which because of specific provisions in the tax law permits wealth to be passed within the family and even from one generation to another completely free of income tax estate and gift taxes you should shop for insurance as you would for consumer goods rates and terms of policies are regulated by law in most states but are by no means uniform or standard one company may offer a better deal on payment life insurance but not in term insurance a check can be made of any insurance company by calling or writing your states insurance commissioners office keep in mind that state licensing laws vary and the company that is licensed to do business in many states is a safe company with which to do business term insurance offers the most protection for the lowest premium in all but very special cases however you dont accumulate cash values many people consider it best to buy insurance at the lowest possible premium rate and invest the difference saved by buying term insurance in common stocks savings accounts and mutual fund shares one important thing to remember is that if you do buy term insurance be sure its the type that is both renewable and convertible this gives you the privilege either to renew the policy as term insurance or to convert it to a different type of policy mutual companies offer dividends to their policyholders these socalled dividends are not taxed by the government for a very simple reasonthe dividend is only a form of refund on an overcharge which brings us to the question of whether or not dividends should be allowed to accumulate suppose you are paying per year for endowment policy which has accumulated dividends of available after youve held the policy for a number of years in effect you are now insured for only because your equity in the policy is available upon your request yet you are paying premiums for of coverage you might be able to secure the same amount of coverage for a great deal less or you might protect your loved ones with a lot more insurance with the same amount of premium before you make a decision to cash in such a policy check what premium youd have to pay at your present age for a term policy or what arrangements could be made to convert the endowment policy at age when taken out to a payment life or straight life contract another factor to consider is the rate of return you are receiving for the accumulated dividends left with the company youll be amazed to learn that most companies are paying around two per cent while you can earn anywhere from to per cent by depositing dividends in a federally insured savings account if you suffer from a disability and consider yourself uninsurable take heart several large insurance companies have set up plans to cover cases formerly considered as uninsurable also you can try to obtain coverage in group contracts where physical examinations are not required at work or through an association or club offering group insurance to members you can also ask your present insurance carrier if you can use accumulated dividends to buy paidup insurance savings bank insurance is generally cheaper because no commissions are paid to brokers or agents generally of the first years premium and per year for the next nine years is paid to insurance salesmen savings bank insurance is not available in all sections of the country and even where available you wont be able to obtain the flexibility in the contracts and the options which are available from most private insurance companies gi insurance is very reasonable in price and those who do not have policies and are in a position to obtain government insurance are missing a surefire money saver if they do not take advantage of the opportunity to get back to the subject of insurance tax shelter our present laws provide that insurance contracts can be exchanged tax free there is no current tax dilution on such insurance exchanges as there is on practically every other switch of investment ie switch from one stock to another because of change in investment objectives a life insurance contract can be exchanged tax free for another life insurance contract annuity or endowment an endowment for another endowment or annuity an annuity for another annuity contract annuities are given tax protection and this tax protection continues as long as the annuitant lives on the death of the assured any gainthe difference between premium costs and lump sum death proceedsreceived by the beneficiaries is free from income tax if your surviving spouse elects to receive death proceeds in installments there will be an increased payment made to such spouse to reflect interest on the delay in making full settlement such spouse can receive not only face of the policy but also the interest factor tax free until such interest exceeds per year insurance proceeds are not subject to income tax they are nevertheless subject to estate taxes by inclusion in the estate of the deceased even though the proceeds are payable to a beneficiary but even here there is a way out all you have to do to remove insurance policies from inclusion in the estate is to give away ownership of the policy during your lifetime this means giving away the incidents of ownershipright to cash in the policy right to borrow on the policy right to change the beneficiary right to sell the policy etc you should pricecompare to get the best available contract for the premiums paid one way you can assure this is to ask the advice and counsel of an insurance consultant these consultants give advice only and charge a fee to tell you how to make the most of your insurance premiums the consultant does not sell insurance but only offers advice and will refer you back to your own broker or agent to make any changes in your coverage health insurancein the average american family medical care has become a biggerthanever expensereviewing these costs two facts will become obvious to you first each bill by itself seems pretty high and second there are an awful lot of them what can you do about it the answer isnt to cut down on trips to the doctor dentist or optometrist the costs of adequate health care has risen tremendously during the past few decades as a nation we are spending over billion each year on medical care or about for every man woman and child family health costs average about per year health economics and good health rank in importance with sufficient food adequate housing recreation and other social and economic needs and concerns of the general population especially amongst the aged voluntary health insurance is playing an important part in providing persons of all ages with health care in essence a program of health insurance is a means of minimizing the economic impact of medical care or of loss of wages through disability through the use of insurance principles which produce a fair sharing of the cost essentially this is a systematic budgetary arrangement by which a person may pay medical bills or have income continued during a period of disability in recent years the american people made new gains toward meeting the costs of their health care more than million people carried hospital or medical expense insurance in more than million of these were wage earners who were insured under programs or other arrangements designed to help replace lost income during periods of disability following are some of the more popular types of coverage available hospital expense protection hospital expense benefits provided by insurance plans help pay the cost of the hospitals daily roomandboard charge and other hospital services such as the use of the operating room laboratory tests surgical dressings and drugs to help meet the rising hospital costs insurance organizations are providing larger hospital daily benefits there is also a trend to extend maximum periods for which benefits will be paid surgical expense protection surgical expense policies provide for operations performed by physicians both in and out of hospitals regular medical expense protection these policies pay the physicians fee for nonsurgical care and often help pay for diagnostic xray and laboratory expenses this coverage also pays for doctor visits to the hospital major medical expense this type of coverage provides protection against virtually all types of health expensesin and out of hospital as long as treatment is prescribed by a physician it even helps pay for costs for special nursing care xray prescriptions and medical appliances among other services insurance companies provide major medical expense protection through group plans individual or family policies many blue cross blue shield and medical societyapproved plans offering extended coverage have been included in the basic hospitalsurgicalmedical plans previously mentioned major medical plans are usually identified by three features the deductible amount the coinsurance feature and high maximum benefits the deductible is the predetermined initial amount the insured person pays of covered expenses before benefit payments begin the insurance company then pays to per cent of the remaining covered expenses with the insured person paying the balance called the coinsured feature benefits provided under major medical plans run as high as or even higher the maximum amount of benefits per year under major policies can apply on a per illness or per injury basis or to the total amount of expenses for all disabilities under the group mechanism major medical expense coverage is provided either on a supplementary or a comprehensive basis on a supplementary basis protection for catastrophic conditions is provided as a complement to basic hospital surgical or regular medical expense protection already in force often an uninsured margin of medical expensefrequently called the corridor amount exists between the basic and supplementary major medical expense plans this corridor functions as the deductible in this instance under comprehensive major medical plans both basic and catastrophic protection is provided in a single plan and these plans are generally available with an initial low deductible amount such as to under both types the insurance company pays to per cent of all hospital and medical expenses above the deductible amount prescribed or rendered by a physician loss of income because of disability loss of income protection provided by insurance companies or through similar wage continuation plans helps replace income lost by wage earners as a result of disability more than threefifths of the total civilian labor force in the united states is protected against the loss of income by insurance company plans or similar formal wage continuation plans personal accident and specific dread disease insurance these policies protect against loss of income against the loss of income or expenses incurred by a specific disease eg polio policies and many provide for accidental loss of life or for dismemberment group accidental death and dismemberment insurance these policies cover most of the contingencies of the previously mentioned policies but coverage is available only to groupsemployee groups associations clubs professional groups etc life insurance many life insurance policies provide for the payment of monthly cash benefits in the event of the policyholders total and permanent disability liability insurance home owners policies and automobile policies can contain medical expense reimbursement provisions to cover the insureds responsibility but also to cover himself and his immediate family usually these benefits are payable even if the insured is at fault workmens compensation this is to provide employees with protection against expenses incurred as a result of an onthejob accident or sickness caused by the nature of the work payments are also made for loss of earnings and for accidental death or permanent disability sick benefits four statesrhode island california new jersey and new york have compulsory laws providing for reimbursement of wage loss due to offthejob sickness or accident medical care by federal authority medical care is furnished by the government in veterans hospitals to veterans in need or veterans suffering from nonservice connected disabilities and of course from disabilities directly connected with service in the armed forces social security disability under certain conditions persons who are covered under the provisions of the federal oldage survivors and the disability insurance act can receive disability payments if they are permanently and totally disabled dental expense policies this is the latest type of insurance protection to mitigate large bills only about persons are presently estimated to be covered by prepaid dental health plans but the idea is catching hold and more and more groups are being formed to provide this type of protection the group health dental insurance inc of new york is an example of nonprofit public plans premiums are modest a husband and wife with two children can visit a dentist of their choice and have him paid by the ghdi if he is a participating dentist for family incomes under the dentist accepts the insurance payment as payment in full for nonparticipating dentists or where family income is over the ghdi pays a set allowance above which the insured has to pay included in the overall dental care is xrays anesthesia and aftercare plus allowances for oral surgery all of this protection is available for only per month dental societies in states have started nonprofit dental service corporations as the forerunner of an overall dental insurance program the blue cross too is experimenting with the inclusion of this coverage as one of its services and is presently operating a prepaid dental plan in an upstate new york county health plans for elder citizens the insurance industry has tried to head off government intervention in the area of providing health care for the nations fast growing senior citizen population most accident and health policies have provisions for the payment of benefits caused by sickness or accident to cease at age however this fact creates a big problem the person who is over usually has reduced earnings and cannot stand the burden of medical expenses even those policies which continue to pay past the th birthday for disabilities commencing prior to the th birthday fall short of providing adequate protection older persons who had little chance of buying health insurance at a relatively reasonable cost several years ago now can get it regardless of their physical condition intensive enrollment drives aimed at persons or older have been scheduled by at least four major insurance companies during this coming year these companies do not ask any medical questions require no medical examination and either the applicant or a relative may buy the policy by mail connecticut is perhaps the first of these plans designed primarily for the elderly who could not afford the insurance plans which were available started by continental casualty in the plan spread from state to state so that by the company was represented in all states buying the policy how to get the best possible health insurance policy for the premium dollar is a perplexing problem it can safely be said that no two accident and health and supplemental coverages policies are exactly alike but what you should know is that each company sets forth the premium charge for each item contained in its contracts you should also note that while companies do offer package policies they are for the most part ready willing and able within the confines of state law to plan a policy to suit your individual needs tailormade policies have an advantage in that you pay for what you want and for what you can use you are in a position to avoid paying for coverage you already have in other policies or for coverage which you do not need you pay considerably more if you want loss of income coverage for sickness to commence with the first day of sickness actually it is the extended sickness which will play havoc with your finances and an eight day or fifteen day or thirty day policy will provide protection against the loss of income for extended sickness and will cost a great deal less in premiums many today are buying their policy protection for their homes as a packagecalled homeowner forms one of the advantages to this was the elimination of duplicate coverages and a considerable savings in premiums brokers have put up super packages which contain an individuals home needs life insurance and accident and health program an opportunity is given to pay for this overall insurance program on a monthly basis by financing the premium due with a premium financing company however the trend in this direction runs counter to the advice of most moneymanagement experts who advocate the more economical annual or triennial payment of insurance premiums they frown on unnecessary borrowing especially on a highcost shortterm basis the spreading of the premiums over the year can probably be accomplished at far less cost financing charges of insurance premiums cost from to per cent per year if policies are grouped to effect savings and the renewal dates are staggered throughout the year and premiums are paid quarterly or semiannually thus all policies for ones automobile those for the home or apartment those for life insurance those for hospital expense accident and health would be grouped into categories and arranged with renewal dates spread throughout the entire year almost as if caught up y in a national fad many college campuses a throughout america c are becoming populated with students who are referred to in a variety of descriptive terms including those of white liberal historically the growth of the white liberal movement closely parallels the enslavement of negroes in this country therefore this is not a new movement but an old one which hasdue to current social conditionsassumed questionable importance the major questions which this analysis raises are related to the social and political implications of the modern white liberal movement do the modern white liberals have the same firebrand leadership quality as those in wendell phillips era or are they instead ideological miscarriages incapable of moving from utopian theory into democratic action basically it is the quality of their social action stuff and not the quantity that will occupy our thoughts it should be noted at the outset that many of the comments pertaining to the white liberal are also appropriate for his counterpart the negro liberal towards a definition the words white liberal are emotionally toned symbols which evoke a variety of images ranging from bearded sandaled grade school dropouts to cleanshaven expensivelyshod college presidents all of whom frequently lock arm in arm in order to walk down a street and sing we shall overcome somewhere between these caricatures we may find a more representative group of people upon whom we can attach the label white liberal levistrauss observed that in any society it is inevitable that a percentage of individuals find themselves placed as it were outside of any system or between two or more irreducible systems the group asks and even requires that these individuals represent certain forms of compromise which cannot be achieved on the collec tive level that they simulate imaginary transitions and embody incompatible systhesis one of the few points that observers like levistrauss can agree upon is the marginality of the white liberal he is at best in an ambiguous position between two contrasting ethnic groups he is a member of the oppressors seeking to help the oppressed rhetorically he stands between two different and often conflicting cultures armed with hope and what at times seems to be an unsatiable ideal the american dream david danzig writing in commentary identified what he perceived to be two schools of white liberalism one whose ultimate goal is the gradual absorption of deserving negroes into white so ciety and one whose ultimate goal is equal rights of all people based upon their status positions in his excellent book the negro mood lerone bennett jr refers to institutional liberals such as certain labor and religious groups and administrative liberals especially social workers and governmental agency executives other writers place the white liberals on a continum with the philosophically wellgrounded altruistic liberal at one end and the confused but wellmeaning and ofttimes dangerous dogooder at the other end borrowing from aaron antonovskys excellent redefinition of the marginal man we may define the white liberal as follows a member of the dominant culture in terms of power and reward potential who seeks to facilitate the movement of members of a less dominant culture into the dominant culture power or powerless is the white liberal an intermediary between the socalled negro community and the white power structure thereby being able to successfully negotiate racial equality howard zinns book the new abolitionists builds a strong case for this position and louis lomax implied as much in the negro revolt the negro is committed to action if the white liberal will use his power and influence to ready his people for honest orderly response the child of change will be born with less pain less hysteria and less loss of blood on the other hand saul alinsky ralph bunche and james baldwin seem to reflect a growing view that the white liberal is but a powerless inept follower in the white community alinsky referred to white liberals as having the tendency to leave the civil_rights struggle when a fight begins ralph bunche once called them mawkish missionaryminded sentimentalists and baldwin asserted that there is no role for the white liberal he is the negros affliction perhaps the greatest criticism of the white liberal is that he is not a liberal but a moderate in philosophical disguise while the white liberal may have membership in the dominant culture it also seems probable that he often lacks power to provide negroes with the much needed social and political boots for an operation bootstraps of equality his liberal actions frequently are interpreted as being somewhat uncle tomishand indeed tend to alienate nonliberal whites including those in power positions jews in particular are disproportionately highly represented in civil_rights activities but disproportionately lowly represented in the white power structure in addition many jewish scholars have been accused of using the negro cause as a means for gaining academic acclaim and financial renumeration its a sad day a disgruntled negro leader frowned when the foremost negro experts are not negroes but jews the precarious position of the white liberal is further undermined by negro patterns of reverse segregation robert penn warren who speaks for the negro charles silberman chrisis in black and white and lewis killian and charles grigg racial crisis in america wrote about many negroes feeling that the presence of white liberals in their organizations are preventing them from achieving racial equality they feel that the sitins prayins marches and other civil_rights activities should be allnegro productionswritten produced directed and acted by negroes still other negroes feel that most white liberals are neither prepared nor willing to assume roles less than top leadership the number of white directors and negro assistant directors in civil_rights or human relations agencies give weight to this fear how come an angry negro civil_rights demonstrator asked the writer whenever we want to complain to the man he always brings in a handful of company negroes who aint even directing themselves not to mention their departments ironically often whites who assume positions of leadership in negro organizations tend to lose touch with both the white power structure and also the other members of the white community such leaders become negroized losing their marginal position and moving into the less dominant culture the negroized white liberal looks like sounds like and suffers like negroes on these rare occasions the white liberal does not have to ask what it is like to be a negro if pressed to generalize about the modern white liberal this writer would say that he the white liberal is but a shadow of the man many civil_rights goals have been lost by the intervention of the white liberal of course many other activities have been won by such intervention however it seems that his lack of complete acceptance in either culture greatly limits the intermediary role of the white liberal and bolsters the cry for black_power new directions a more effective role for the white liberal probably will emerge when the latent anxieties of whites and negroes are subjected to a frank open dialogue it is time to move away from the eternally nice but superficial conversations the goals roles and extent of involvement of both whites and negroes engaging in the civil_rights struggle should be frankly discussed specifically how much does each participant expect to become involved and under what conditions the lack of sincere dialogue is not unique to the modern civil_rights struggle as early as negro freedmen lamented save us from our friendswe know understand and can cope with our enemies we have named them we have them under control it seems axiomatic that total commitment to equality of opportunity for all people is mandatory for the white liberal however total commitment to all civil_rights activities is not mandatory everyone need not march pray picket or go to jail conversely some activity beyond intellectual vociferation seems needed in order to assure the negro masses that the white liberal is not all show and no go this activity as an illustration can be as magnanimous as not fleeing from his neighborhood when negroes move in or the equally supportive act of correcting erroneous remarks made by friends a clear delineation of his projected role at the outset would minimize role inconsistencies of the white liberal by so doing he is less likely to be accused of lacking real commitment to civil_rights as he openly ponders his next move the white liberal is categorized as being a friend of freedom who pauses and hesitates it is this hesitation that caused alinsky to prefer being called a white radical rather than liberal what seems to be but a play on words does in fact get at the esssence of the functional value of the negrowhite partnership in the civil_rights struggle because it is a fad for many white citizens the liberal cause is adopted after all this is an activity about which they can tell their chilldren and grandchildren so they join civil_rights groups without a clear idea as to what they are willing to do this basic uncertainty is compounded by such questions as how they should talk act and dress these then are the confused but wellmeaning dogooders whom we mentioned earlier others join civil_rights causes because of a clear belief in and definition of their roles unfortunately too few white liberals seem to be of this vintage thus it is not the philosophically wellgrounded white liberal who has become the model for the white liberal stereotype but the confused dogooder at this juncture it should be repeated that many of the comments pertaining to the white liberal are appropriate for his counterpart the negro liberal i watched a itu s roup of people enjoy rvw t a performance by comedian bin cosy i was impressed with the humor of the man but i noticed a very curious thing the members of the group seemed to enjoy him even more than the basic humor of his material seemed to warrant after the show i asked one of my white friends why hes just a very funny guy thats all i wasnt satisfied with this and so we discussed the whole thing in more detail at one point it developed that my friend thought that cosby was funnier than dick gregory when i inquired why the answer was just funnier i mean hes really funny just funny theres no race stuff to his material so that was it and that seems to be it with people all over america when it comes to dick gregory what my friend meant was that dick gregory made him think this facet of dick gregorys personality is his greatest contribution to his profession and to his culture of course i dont feel i need mention the fact that in all likelihood there would not have been any bill cosby without dick gregory but there have been other comics who have caused us to thinkwill rogers for example but the difference is that gregory makes us think about the most inhumane sordid unjust ugly social political and economic phenomenon in americainequality but more than that the man worms his humor down into our conscience and makes us squirm none of us likes that except those who are doing all they can to help solve the problem the reason my friend enjoyed bill cosby over and beyond the natural humor of his presentation was the fact that here was a negro comic at last who was funny and didnt remind him about selma jackson birmingham indianola etc his relief manifested itself in the extra show of appreciation and deliverance he mustered in his laughter my friend is not alone in this this same guilt is displayed by others for example a few years back the late nat cole had a very good television show that folded because the madison avenue boys claimed they couldnt get backing for the show now cosby comes along and with less than a years time in the big time he is given an opportunity to appear in his own series my point is that cosby is being welcomed with open arms because he represents a relief to the consciences of people after gregorys constant bombardment against the state of racial affairs in america they can wave cosby around and say see were doing our part but gregorys scathing remarks not only affect the consciences of whites they raise havoc with negroes also he is a constant reminder of what a negro can and ought to do many negroes like whites would like to put their head in the sand and wait until the storm blows over this attitude can best be exemplified in the comment im too violent to be involved in a nonviolent demonstration but gregory has an answer for them baby if you look up and see one of them big mississippi sheriffs with his big revolver cattle rod dog and rope youll become nonviolent as hell and it wont take long either then there is the guy who says i have a good job i have a family to support gregs comment how in the hell do you think you got that job baby i lose more money in missed engagements in a month going down there than you make in a whole year now the negro has his back to the wall just like the white person because greg not only preaches it he practices it there is a possibility that the reason that greg has all of the answers is because he knows all the questions how did he come to know all of the questions and the excuses because he too had his head hidden at one time his head was in the clouds my acquaintance with greg goes back to i remember that my first impression of him centered around the fact that he had tremendous drive and ambition only one thing mattered to greg and that was to make it this monomaniacal drive was not only commendable but was also very wise because that was the only way a poor black man could make it but somewhere between the time greg was struggling to make it and the time he made it something happened to his own attitudes perhaps it was the fact that although the mayor of his hometown gave him a welcome home parade there were places there where he couldnt even go to eat perhaps it was because he could stand up on the stage and entertain a thousand people but there were some who would not and could not entertain him in their homes maybe it was the realization that he could have a thousand dollars in his pocket the admiration of millions and the acquaintance of the head of state and yet be reduced to something less than a man by some bum calling him a nigger like most people who have been converted greg is devout and intense in his newfound faith having come from the side that makes excuses he makes it his most urgent business to now be just the opposite thats why he hits so hard and effectively he can anticipate the rationalizations of others because he used them himself at one time understanding how they think and feel and understanding fully the crisis that exists he can penetrate and pain more than most his constant pinpricking of the american conscience has caused something of an antigregory cult to arise i dont expect that it will be easy for greg to continue to be the conscience of his audience im sure hes aware of the fact that some of his fans have dropped away because he refuses to let them relax and shrug their shoulders about the race problem he by his own actions shows them how and what to do he says do as i say and do as i do but i dont believe that greg has the inclination nor desire to cross back over to the complacent let martin_luther_king do it category he is in a very strange position for he serves as something of a barometer of race relations in america for if america accepts him it will be because her conscience is clear if she rejects him it will be because she cannot afford to have him constantly reminding her of her gross failure its something of a shame that america should need someone like dick gregory but its extremely fortunate that there was someone like gregory ready and able when the time came the negro creative writj f i er in the united states i t is in an unenviable position if he like white writers chooses as his raw material his own experiences and the life reverberating around him he is likely to find only halfhearted acceptance from editors and publishers it will make little difference how well he writes or how fresh and sharp his vision if he treats his material with honesty and holds onto his own integrity what he writes will strike even sympathetic whites as accusatory if on the other hand the negro writer chooses to follow the line of least resistance guarding his work from telltale implications of his own racial identity he may find a kind of success but he is unlikely to fulfill whatever potential he possesses for artistic achievement and this is so simply because no man reaches the summit of his own potential through the conscious denial of who he is and of the forces which have formed him many negro writers have failed because they sought to write as writers not as negro writers not understanding that in a racist and segregationist societyas the american society inherently is their claim to being merely writers and not negro writers has no meaning at all for if their subjects are negroes then the facts of life in america will dictate that the racism and segregation be dealt with in one way or another and if their subjects are whites it is altogether probable that white writers know them better and can present them with more clarity depth and honesty these negro writers failed because they sought to do the impossible and their failure is understandable the critics and the editors and the publishers told them and tell negro writers even now that the reading public which is predominantly white has little interest in negro problems and more damaging still that there is nothing universal in the negro experience in his introduction to the anthology american negro short stories hill wang editor john henrik clarke says of the negro renaissancewhich covered the years between and that it was the richest and most productive period in negro writing in the united states perhaps this is so but if it is then it also means that the negro renaissance was not very rich and productive at all by objective standards but for the reasons already advanced this fact does not surprise after all the work turned out by the writers of the negro renaissance had to find publishers and publishers did not fall over themselves rushing up to harlem claude mckay that excellent poet of the period struggled valiantly to keep a literary journal alive in the end crisis and opportunity the nonliterary organs of social units floated by white funds provided the only somewhat continuous outlet for negro writing and so if relatively few negro writers of short fiction or any fiction came to prominence it is understandable yet on the evidence of mr clarkes anthology and of two other anthologies due for early publication negro writers continued to turn out short stories many of excellent qualityover the years two of the new anthologies mr clarkes and one edited by langston hughes and called the best of negro short stories little brown coare in fact surveys of negro short story writing over the past century the anthologies contain stories by charles waddell chestnutt and paul laurance dunbar who were writing before the turn of the century and stories by the negro renaissance era writers claude mckay arna bontemps eric waldron jean toomer sterling brown rudolph fischer and langston hughes himself the two anthologies include works by a number of writers whose productive periods bridged the gap between the negro renaissance and the new era ushered in by the searing essays of james baldwin among these names are zora neale hurston dorothy west ted poston carl ruthven oftord john p davis arthur p davis john caswell smith and katherine dunham also represented are the talented writers who gained recognition in the wake of richard wrights success with his first explosive novel native son these writers are chester himes ralph ellison willard motley owen dodson ann petry and john oliver killens both anthologies feature short stories by frank yerby the single negro author who found a formula for fiction and stuck to it with great financial success other writers who gained eminence in the late forties and in the fifties and who are represented in the clarke and hughes anthologies are gwendolyn brooks mary elizabeth vroman paule marshall frank london brown alice childress alston anderson james baldwin john a williams and john henrik clarke himself the negro writers of the sixties some of whom are contributors to the new anthologies promise a ringing challenge to john henrik clarkes contention that the negro renaissance was the richest and most productive period in negro writing in the united states already this group of young writers have produced a stunning body of work and many of them have only begun their careers the john a williams anthology beyond the angry black was published several years ago as a paperback and the revised hard cover edition published by cooper square will have one deletion a ralph ellison excerpt and several additions it is not precisely an anthology of short stories and not all its contributors are negroes but the emphasis is on short fiction the younger negro authors in the williams anthology are james baldwin junius edwards s p lomax gloria c oden and carrie allen young others are gwendolyn brooks chester himes langston hughes margaret walker and richard wright white contributors to the williams anthology are john howard griffin the late shirley jackson abram kardiner and lionel ovesey seymour krim dennis lynds john w mcreynolds and paul olsen the hughes and clarke anthologies boast fine new writers who have been read principally in little magazines notably negro digest among this group are martin j hamer conrad kent rivers ernest j gaines pearl crayton mike thelwell and woodie king jr the new and powerful writers of the sixties whose works are in the clarke and hughes anthologies are ronald l fair lerone bennett jr william melvin kelley paule marshall ronald milner robert boles kristin hunter charles wright ernest j gaines and leroi jones all of these writers also have produced novels or books of essays plays biography and history completing the entire list of authors represented in all three new books are loyle hairston alice walker sylvester leaks albert murray charlie russell r j meaddough iii clifford vincent johnson cyrus colter hoyt w fuller and lindsay patterson only a few of the stories are famous the hughes anthology reprints this morning this evening so soon one of the finest of james baldwins fictional works the anthology also includes frank yerbys short story health card which won an o henry award and launched mr yerbys career the clarke anthology includes a sketch it is not really a story by the late great w e b du bois whose career as novelist essayist historian polemicist and bibliographer spanned several generations before his death in ghana on the eve of the march on washington the hughes anthology features a story by the legendary jean toomer often called the best creative writer cane of the negro renaissance period the fairskinned mr toomer apparently stopped writing and rumor has it retired to a country squires life in rural pennsylvania for those who have never read or have forgotten richard wrights early story of black and white communists in mississippi in the thirties bright and morning star will prove a revelation all the power and anger of the writers great talent leap out from the pages and seize the reader and it is not protestas the critics have labeled it it is a great bitter moving story it is reprinted in mr clarkes anthology of the newer writers those who seem to most effectively have mastered the art of short fiction are ernest j gaines paule marshall william melvin kelley and martin j hamer but then they are all good writers period and three of them have published excellent novels the stories in the three anthologies range all over america the west indies europe and africa and there is no single guiding rule by which they may be measured they are in fact as rich and varied and complex as life itself taken together the stories and articles and poems in beyond the angry black the best of negro short stories and american negro short stories tell more about the history of negroes in americaand of their relationship with whites than shelves of volumes of history and sociologyhwf i recall upon meeting m b tolson at the fisk writers conference last spring asking him if he accepted the label given him by karl shapiro the poet who writes in negrowell my boy he answered youll see this afternoon and his generous smile although halfteasing was like his voicewithout a trace of condescension it was certain that the afternoon would affirm what i had surmised one sensed in the dancing eyes that guided his finally weary frame not mere longevity but rare vision and a sense of life his presence was gently humbling evoking joy pride and a most exact anxiety the way he said my boy with such warm affection lingers yet not inspired by me personally i think but rather an extension of the warmth shared by thousands of young black people whose fortune it was to be counted among his students suddenly i felt cheatedculturally deprived yesthat i had not been one of them and moreover cheated because m b tolson had in fact been hidden from me as shapiro has written a great poet has been living in our midst for decades and is almost totally unknown on sunday august dr melvin b tolson poet laureate of liberia distinguished professor of the humanities at tuskegee institute was taken from us succumbing to a long battle with cancer my heart was saddened but amid the sadness there is gladness in the realization that my heart however briefly was among those touched by m b tolson the word charisma comes to mind but not unlike other words that come to mind is insufficient in capturing the spiritgiving force conveyed by tolson a man whose absence from our minds and our lives while with us is but another chapter in this unspeakably bitter travail i recall an associate in a telephone conversation saying to mr tolson we need you it was a fitting tribute to a man whose works speak profoundly of his years for me meeting m b tolson was like experiencing a contemporary nat turner a man whose message to black people could not be encouraged the street was full when the young couple entered the chinese restaurant it was a favorite place to them because the neighborhood had been recently integrated and they could not afford the luxury of exploring some of the more interesting places it was a chilly day the sky was hard and cloudy im really famished helen said that makes two of us oliver replied a waiter met them at the door they knew exactly where they wanted to sit several of the waiters gave them warm nods of approval as they pointed to a table near the kitchen gerald oliver his eyes gleaming studied his bride she now held a menu and began to read aloud her face was round and attractive and her dimples gave hei a youthful appearance what about sweet and soui pork

nodded approval to oliver the old man reached over and touched helens face the waiter who was returning with their meal sensed trouble helen jerked her face away sir the waiter said ill put your drink

their skins he said why the hell you think im here most every week for the waiter removed himself with oriental dignity you live in the neighborhood asked oliver helen was disturbed she hated embarrassing situations however the few other customers did not seem to be taking notice forty years thats nice nice nice nice is that all you can say to an old white man hell i can remember when you

buildings around here thats nice said oliver like hell it is we got all jews whats so bad about that the old man watched them closely he broke into a wide smile first it was all wops and swedes then the neighborhood went to pot helen watched the expression on his face slowly change she had been right about him the first time she thought then you people came i like colored all right meg my wife feels ashamed to be working around em why is it you feel so different i have a lot of colored friends you get to know people after a while youre too young to remember ethel waters i know well just

helens face oliver signaled for the waiter they paid their check and got up from the table after the waiter returned with their change the old man did not notice them when they left he was still talking to himself when they walked out into the night air helen still felt the old mans hand upon her face and she hated his white skin even more
e deeply appreciate y wjsj the honor that deyv volves upon us at the first world festival of negro arts to welcome so many talents from the four continents from the four horizons of the spirit but what honors us most of all and what constitutes your greatest merit is the fact that you will have participated in an undertaking much more revolutionary than the exploration of the cosmos the elaboration of a new humanism which this time will include the totality of humanity on the planet earth senegal welcomes you therefore as distinguished guests and first of all dakar greets you thus fulfilling its mission for dakar a black plowshare cast in the fertile ocean has always answered the call of the tradewinds and welcomed visitors arriving by sea or by air thus we can enter into a dialogue the mainspring of civilizations or at any rate of culture here we are here you are assembled ethnologists and sociologists historians and linguists writers and artists your task will be to seek out to spell out the junction of negro art in the life of the black man the function or rather the signs but basically you will probe beyond those signs to discover their meaning today more modestly as an old militant of nigritude i should like to say less about the function and meaning of negro artwhich i have tried to treat elsewherethan about the function and significance that we senegalese attribute to this first world festival of negro arts in a word if we have assumed the terrible responsibility of organizing this festival it is for the defense and illustration of nigritude for people are continuing here and there throughout the world to deny african art as well as negritude by which i mean the negro values of civilization and when they can no longer deny negro art because it is so evident they try to contest its originality its human truth african art has been denied on the pretext that it presents different forms and in fact if it is indeed an entity it is in the diversity of its fields its types even its styles like european art which under its italian french german russian or swedish appearance derives from grecolatin civilization from discursive reason animated by christianity like european art which subjected to frequent revolutions nevertheless remains european in its fundamental characteristics to return to african art it is all the more a unit because if its function is always to actualize its object i mean its matter its nature on the contrary is always to express this object by means of the same signs in the same profound style which is precisely to stylize it as a result one can not long deny negro art because the europeans themselves were the first to discover and to define itthe negro africans preferred to live it the most eminent european artists and writers defended it from pablo picasso to andre malraux whose presence here i salute as conclusive evidence and i need not speak about the african and american negro writers and artists who between the two world wars and since have won the attention of a world torn apart and which because it was tom asunder was seeking its unity its authenticity unable then to deny negro art they have tried to minimize its originality claiming that it had no monopoly either over emotion or over the analogical image not even over the rhvthm and it is true that every genuine artist has these gifts whatever his continent his race his nation may be nevertheless rimbaud had to claim kinship with negritude picasso had to be overwhelmed by a baoule mask apollinaire had to sing of wooden fetishes before western european art would consent after two thousand years to abandon physeds mimesis the imitation of nature it is in large measure the fault of negro arta very fortunate fruitful faultthat the artists of that same western world are inspired today like bazaine by the kmost obscure effort of instinct and sen sitivity and that like masson they define the work of art as a simple play of forms and values that are legibly organized in brief a simply rhythm a play of forces my friend soulages would have said because rhythm is harmonious movement in that it signifies forms but it is not only a question of defending the negro art of the past as it is exhibited today in the musee dynamique it is even more a matter of making it illustrious by showing what it is in the middle of the twentieth century a gusher that does not run dry a basic significant element of the civilization of the universal which is being constructed before our eyes by us and for us by all and for all and first of all for the negro writers and artists as is evidenced by the exposition of contemporary art which bears the meaningful title tendencies and confrontation and so after the first and then the second world war from everywhereafrica america and the very heart of europeyoung black men and girls have risen like young trees pruned by those two wars from the depth of their ancestral experiences from the depth of their more recent experiences as slaves and as colonized people or simply as men of this century wide open to all contributions they have discovered along with a new vision of the world the new words of the new negro words that they provided their works did not need to be placed in anthologies or in museums to fulfill that function which is to express life to represent it so as to help men all men to live better to help their black brothers before all others think of the former black slaves of america deported from mother africa if they did not surrender to the taedium vitae tedium of life if they did not give up like other races destined to die in weak sorrowful languor it was because they had carried within them from the motherland along with the lust for life that creative power which is the original trademark of art for art is nothing other than this primal gesture of homo sapiens thinking man who representing life by the symbolic image intensifies it by rhythm thus magnifying it to give it the value of eternity such at least is negro art and to refer again to the negro americans the art of negro spirituals and the blues the most ordinary labor of the peasant the most painful labor of the slave vivified because it is magnified by the word by the song by the dance by the rhythmic energy which is the very stuff of life but slavery belongs to the past today in senegal to take a current example the new national art rooted in the black basalt of cap vert is being built up once again in dakar a crossroads swept by all the pollens in the world as well as by images and ideas saving us from despair this negro art sustains us in our effort toward economic and social development in our determination to live so too do our poets short story writers and novelists our singers and dancers our painters and sculptors our musicians whether they paint violent mystical abstractions or the noble elegance of royal african courtships whether they sculpt the national lion or fantastic monsters whether they dance the development plan or sing the diversification of crops the negro african artists the senegalese artists of today help us to live today to live a better more abundant life to live more that is to say more intensely reinforcing the high tension that characterized the north suda nese negro african civilization to live better in order to resolve the concrete problems that condition our future listening to me one might believe that negro art is only a technique an ensemble of means at the service of a civilization of the comfortable or in any case at the service of material production let me explain i have spoken not merely of economic growth but of development that is to say the correlative and complementary totality of matter and spirit of the economic and social of the body and the soul i have spoken at the same time of the production of material goods and spiritual goods when i speak of negritude i am referring to a civilization where art is at once technique and vision handicraft and prophecy where art expresses in the words of ogotemmeli the identity of material gestures and spiritual forces the same aged negro said the other day the weaver sings as he pushes his shuttle and his voice continues the chain aiding and leading the chant of the ancestors this means simply that all art in black africa weaving sculpture painting music and danceis speech or better still the wrd mean poetry in fact form and colors timbres and tones movement even the materials used by the artists have the effectiveness of the word provided they are rhythmic for speech having become the word because it has the rhythm of the primeval movement the form of things named recreates them makes them more present more true thus it accomplishes the action of the creator because by renewing that action it prolongs it by art which once again eternizes the life of things and beings by vivifying and magnifying that life beyond its vital function this is the significance of negro art it makes us resemble god by having us participate in its creation i have almost finished by helping the defense and illustration of negro art senegal is conscious of helping to build the civilization of the universal in fact even before our national independence during the past twenty years or so we have never stopped basing our policy on dialogue in all fields and essentially in the realm of culture for culture is the first requisite and the final objective of all development but to dialogue with others to take part in the common work of conscientious determined men who springing up everywhere in the world to bring new values to the symbiosis of complementary values by which the civilization of the universal is determined we negroes need to be ourselves at long last in our dignity our regained identity to be ourselves by cultivating our own values as we have rediscovered them in the sources of negro art because those values spring from biological geographical and historical data they are over and beyond the profound unity of humanity the hallmark of our originality in thought feeling and action to be ourselves not without borrowing not by procuration but rather by our own personal and collective effort and for ourselves otherwise we should merely be poor copies of others in the musee vivant as the negroes of america were in slavery days until the end of the nineteenth century just as we african negroes were in the days of colonization until the eve of the second world war between the two world wars what the young black men and girls of my generation wanted was to abandon the imitative spirit of the old regime to regain along with the sentiment of our dignity the creative spirit which had been for thousands of years the seal of negritude as revealed by the rupestrian art of the african continent we meant to become once again producers of civilization like our ancestors for we were conscious of the fact that the humanism of the twentieth century which can only be the civilization of the universal would be impoverished if it excluded a single continent once again the problem is posed in terms of complementarity of dialogue and interchange not of opposition or racial hatred moreover how could we negroes reject the scientific and technical discoveries of the european and north american peoples thanks to those discoveries man is seen transforming man himself as well as nature ladies and gentlemen you researchers and professors artists and writers are the real humanists of the present day because senegal has chosen to be the fatherland of dialogue and interchange senegal wishes to be your second country in any event it hopes that the great dialogue that begins here today will contribute to the construction of the earth to the fulfilment of man in the november issue of ramparts magazine james baldwin is quoted in an editorial as saying that he could not accept the proposition that the yearold travail of the american negro should result in the attainment of the present level of american civilization white people cannot in the generality be taken as models of how to live rather the white man is himself in sore need of new standards it would be absurd to challenge this excerpted critique with the contention that baldwin has failed to understand the best values of the establishment the charge most often leveled at social critics it is quite apparent from his work that baldwin understands america only all too wellfar better in fact than do most members of the establishment these same men who disparage his writings would do well to read him closely for the full reality behind baldwins remarks is that the present movement toward accepting the negro into american life is predicated on a maintenance of the traditional white status quo an attitude that implicity assumes its values to be supremely desirable a movement that willin a moment of boundless magnanimityallow the negro to elevate himself to babbitts height if he proves himself worthy enough this attitude is absolutely intolerable it embodies the very essence of white supremacy it must be discarded immediately and a new orientation substituted before it condemns the nation to political and social disaster the arrogance of the wasp establishments selfrighteous condescension in legislating what it has convinced itself is the passionate striving of the negro to be at one with the great white society must be halted at once this belief presumes that its holder has nothing to learn from the negro while the negropoor bedeviled black that he ishas the world to gain by taking communion of the new barbarisms god technos well just whose world will he gain duponts dean rusks the planned though obsolete world of general motors the world of los angeles police chief parker lest the reader think these concerns are solitary ones that they pertain to a few problem areas in the south only and not to northern cities that have no problem let us look at william stringfellows book my people is the enemy his conclusions derive from his years of work in harlem as legal counsel for the poor he found that the political recognition which negroes have so far received has been purchased by the surrender of their identity and integrity as negroes although stringfellow is as much in favor of social change in the urban ghettoes as the next perhaps more he remains by no means persuaded that the standard of social improvement should be that of the great american bourgeoisie americas long history of race war and a biracial culture culminating in the violent emotions of watts should have brought the realization that our course of behavior was neither adequate nor equal to needs one would reasonably assume that having come via watts to sudden national awareness that a very real problem still exists this most pragmatic of nations would now create a mode of reconciliation more realistic more just this has not been the case as slick papers are turned out by professional social workers and cityappointed commissions the reality of violent revolution grows more valid more appealing daily while the most elaborate sophistry is used to justify the selfinterests of local and national power structures and the churches must be included still another summer approaches in its coming heat we may witness a watts in every major city outside the south by the edicts and terms in current usage among the administration one sees there an awareness that a problem exists perversely and predictably it is interpreted as the negro problem rather than as a recent issue of ebony saw it as the white problem of america instead of modifying the environment and content of american life creating a viable culture for all the negro along with his fellow nonwhite will be made over until he suits the economic and governmental intents and purposes he is to serve the national policy to date had been one of massive containment of the negro outside the mainstream of american life this tactic having obviously even embarrassingly failed the strategy has now evolved into one of containment through controlled absorption since we couldnt lick them goes this reasoning let us lure them into the same boat were in moving to the back of course and convince them that our battle is theirs also while i have reservations as to the feasibility of this theory it will probably be accepted by the powersthatbe for it seems to have been worked out on the same computer by the same people who created our china policy nuclear defense notions vietnamese war games anticommunism programs etc it will be used by the empowered until some bright randy young man comes up with a better solution now this is all very fine and good but for this to succeed we must all metamorphisize into creatures whose eyes are able to transform all black into white the negro has never indicated any desire to be made white incidentally may i ask just what is wrong with his blackness we are determined to ramrod a white bill of rights down the negros throat while he is still choking on watts but even as great a task as the resolving of race relations is it is incapable of solution until the central problem of western lifeepitomized in americais successfully confronted we have yet to come to terms with the economic facts of life in a rapidly transitional society a society which has not static stability as its goal but the assimilation of constant flux where individual immersion in change is a way of life and an ability to cope will mark ones status thanks to a hundred years of an imposed cultural lag the negro and tens of millions of other citizens are the victims twiceover of a technology and productive system that penalizes them for the deprivation they have suffered under it it is now claimed that through massive applications of education and relearning programs we can create a citizen who fits into the new society but the intrinsic promise of technology coupled with the rate of development is so rapidly expanding that it is very likely all the crash efforts in the world will not avert huge unemployment to say nothing of further alienation from society such as it is disregarding the what and how of quantity and quality our production systems are running under capacity now while new operations and applied science demands maximum efficiency and output at all levels as private corporations continue to bloat in size and dwindle in number while refusing to regulate the quantity and quality of production or reevaluate its scheme of goals the economy will continue to haphazardly spiral upwards on the charts dependent on the paper tigers of war and waste to maintain high growth rates not molded or educated in the context of an exceedingly complex industrial society the minorities have poured into the cities only to find urban monsters in process of decay as decent living areas tens of millions look on as wealth which they have helped to accrue concentrates and accumulates above them they find they have no voice in the direction or quality of their life yet they live in a nation that will conscript them to die in support of their deprivation youth in anxious rebellion and desperate attempts at selfassertion finding few provisions for creative alternatives turns to drugs violence reactionary conservatism and a hypnotic militarism if these responses are frowned upon what other choices are available in a society that punishes with unbelievable cruelty their efforts at free speech free press free assembly we are just now beginning to pay the price of corporate free enterprise as it is carried out to its selfdefeating ends if the spring is to return to our year then it must be preceeded by a new coordination of national and individual purposes a complete revision of existing laws to be fol lowed by ones that are uniformly regulated and enforced a strict adherence to equality before the law for every person regardless of age and a restoration of participative democracy in an electoral system that has real and meaningful choices not merely an exchanging of administrators within the monolith of bureaucracy perhaps the most amazing aspect of the chaos that is modern american life is the simultaneous existence of agencies and abilities capable of effective reform alongside the most incredible disregard of such opportunities why are they going unheeded the students for a democratic society and the student nonviolent coordinating committee are only two of the agencies for social reform that have risen from the people to meet the peoples needs the growing third party movements the black_panther the freedom democratic party are hopeful elements of correction making their influence felt at the state and local seats of government in the cities especially we have witnessed long overdue corrections come about because of grassroots activism not only are activists and intellectuals available personally by the hundreds but the networks of communications are greater than ever with important variations and differences a deluge of new magazines and journals has brought people everywhere into contact unheard of previously new styles of writing encourage feelings of bondedness even as television confirms the brotherhood of men however distant talented and gifted men are everywhere but in the determining positions of the administration or so their attitudes suggest it is tragically grim to wonder if perhaps a rash of wattses are needed to stir the slumbering washingtonians and america at large in the schools and churches what awareness has trickled down to their participants has been opposed if not eliminated by administration usually for fear of fomenting a revolt from the desks and pews but good god could anything be more fearful than a watts in every city in the land even the ones that have no problem people said voltaire deserve the kind of government they have are we to be historys fools serving only to vindicate voltaires wit the phrases and intonations that one hears are those of consensus and concern for opinion and unanimity words whose contents settle all too easily into complacency smug assurance of right and wrong and finally a cheap fascism of the center we are pursuing a resolution of self cast in such unreal forms that we now stand in grave danger of losing what we most would save our souls not only in the theological sense but in the existential religious meaning also by making available no alternative in the direction or quality of life other than that of mr and mrs babbitt living on new main st in megalopolis usa we are well on the way to culminate in the ultimate consumer culture where a man is the last entry in the biggest bookkeeping operation ever made america to relegate the negro to his proper place as a black cog alongside his fellow white cog in a nationmachine seems to be our national and economic predestination we metaphysic that integrated machines run more efficiently more smoothly more profitably sign seen in business office recently of southern corporation integration pays it is my passionate hope that neither of these cogs comes to pass the warnings of marx dostoyevsky huxley fromm and others have been made and should prove sufficient to right reason and right sentiment to refuse to accept the negros contribution and to refuse to accord him respect for himself is to precipitate disaster i do not believe there is a mystique of negritude or that the negros blackness will magically save us but to eradicate him as if he had never existed which according to most american history texts he never has except for being central to the civil war while bleaching him white will be the last sin of our history does manregardless of his colorhave to become the final unit in a national consuming machine must we push the negro into roles that we are unhappy in ourselves perhaps our misery wishing for company of numbers to alleviate it our national motto should be miseria concordia certainly if anything is to be done to stop this pernicious drift living in an atmosphere of gradualism and detached noninvolvement are not among them wake up dear hearts days of crisis will not be long upon us no matter how we approach it our future nationally and individually is inseparably bound to that of the negro and other minorities the dominant life values of the wasp hive and their attendant social heirarchy must undergo a total reordering we must free ourselves to direct our lives in a sounder healthier manner or we shall persist in the antisocial unloving unkind behavior that has brought chaos into our nation our cities our hearts watts need never happen again if it does it will mean that good men have not been allowed to prevail for the answers we so desperately call for and the means to achieve democratic goals are now with us we have only to make use of them we must engage in a reciprocal relationship with the negro not as negro but as human beings careful to keep that relating alive and quick else we again become as rigid and unrealistic as dead in our hearts and souls as the damnable relationship of our past that there will be profound consequences even unforeseen ones is an ineluctable conclusion what matters most is that we remain positive and open to change change which we must seek to understand not fear though we cannot legislate morality we can create the environment that nurtures and sustains moral relationships to paraphrase the opening sentence of woodwards the strange career of jim crow the people of america should be the last to expect indefinite continuity of their institutions and social arrangements to ignore the negros very real identity and assets is to ignore all humanity to neglect and even betray the heart and vision of what democracy is to mean in america mark twain said effect that when country enslaves people the first necpessary job is to make the world feel that the people to enslaved are subhuman the to make his fellowbe next job is countrymen believe that man is inferior and then the unkindest cut of all is to make that man believe himself inferior a good job has been done on the black people in this country as far as convincing them of their inferiority is concerned the general white community has told us in a million different ways and in no uncertain terms that god and nature made a mistake when it came to the fashioning of us and ours the whole society having been thoroughly convinced of the stained threatening and evil nature of anything unfortunate enough to be or referred to as black as an intended matter of courtesy refers to those of african extraction as colored or negro the fact that negro is the spanish word for black is hardly understood it would seem or it would seem that the word black may be intimated or suggested but never simply stated in good english too many negroes if described or referred to as black take it as an affront and i was once told by a canadian irishman that id insulted him by referring to my person as a black woman he insisted that in actuality i was brown not black and i felt obliged to tell him he described himself as white and that he wasnt white either the fact that white people readily and proudly call themselves white glorify all that is white and whitewash all that is glorified becomes unnatural and bigoted in its intent only when these same whites deny persons of african heritage who are black the natural and inalienable right to readily and proudly call themselves black glorify all that is black and blackwash all that is glorified yet one is forced to conclude that this is not the case at all that an astonishing proportion of the white population finds it discomforting that blacks should dare to feel so much glory in being beautifully black in the face of this kind of reasoning the only conclusion one can logically come to is that there is something wrong with this society and its leadership the mans opinion of god is sorry to put it nicely and his opinion of himself is simply vague and hazy consider swearing his love and devotion to the omnipotent one on the one hand yet defying and cursing him with rank impudence on the other using the crutch of his inherently base and callow nature on the one hand and claiming his godhood on the other worshipping a jew as the son of god on the one hand yet persecuting all other jews as enemies of god on the other historically placing this same jew on the african continent on the one hand and describing him as a european in physical appearance on the other still one would suppose that its tacitly understood by all that god couldnt be anything other than white no matter where he was bom advocating that the black man is made of inferior stuff on the one hand yet defying him not to prove his superiority on the other naming hurricanes for women on the one hand yet h is for the heart as pure as gold on the other giving her pet names such as whore slut bitch etc on the one hand yet put them all together and they spell mother the word that means the world to me on the other no wonder the slogan white is right could take a whole nation by storm one could never accuse this society of being rational still instead of this irrational society warping my delicate little psyche it only drove me ultimately to the conclusion that any black human being able to survive the horrendous and evil circumstances in which one inevitably finds oneself trapped must be some kind of a giant with great and peculiar abilities with an armor as resistant as steel yet made of purest gold my mother is one of the most courageous people i have ever known with an uncanny will to survive when she was a young woman the white folks were much further in the lead than they are now and their racist rules gave her every disadvantage yet she proved herself a queen among women any women and as a result will always be one of the great legends for me but strange as it is ive heard it echoed by too many black full grown males that black woman hood is the downfall of the black man in that she the black woman is evil hard to get along with domineering suspicious and narrowminded in short a black ugly evil you know what as time progresses ive learned that this description of my mothers sisters and partners in crime is used as the basis and excuse for the further shoving by the black man of his own head into the sand of oblivion hence the black mother housewife and allaround girl thursday is called upon to suffer both physically and emotionally every humiliation a woman can suffer and still function her head is more regularly beaten than any other womans and by her own man shes the scapegoat for mr charlie she is forced to stark realism and chided if caught dreaming her aspirations for her and hers are for sanitys sake stunted her physical image has been criminally maligned assaulted and negated shes the first to be called ugly and never yet beautiful and as a consequence is forced to see her man an exact copy of her emotionally and physically brainwashed and wallowing in selfloathing pick for his own the physical antithesis of her the white woman and incubator of his heretofore arch enemy the white man then to add guilt to insult and injury she the black woman stands accused as the emasculator of the only thing she has ever cared for her black man accused by her black man she is the scapegoat for what white america has made of the negro personality raped and denied the right to cry out in her pain she has been named the culprit and called loose hotblooded wanton sultry and amoral she has been used as the white mans sexual outhouse and shamefully encouraged by her own egoless man to persist in this function wanting too to be carried away by her prince charming she must in all honesty admit that he has been robbed of his crown by the very assaulter and assassin who has raped her still she looks upon her man as gods gift to black womanhood and is further diminished and humiliated and outraged when the feeling is not mutual when a white man likes colored girls his woman the white woman is the last one he wants to know about it yet seemingly when a negro likes white girls his woman the black woman is the first he wants to know about it white female rejects and social misfits are flagrantly flaunted in our faces as the ultimate in feminine pulchritude our women are encouraged by our own men to strive to look and act as much like the white female image as possible and only those who approach that goal in physical appearance and social behavior are acceptable at best we are made to feel that we are poor imitations and excuses for white women evil evil you say the black woman is hurt confused frustrated angry resentful frightened and evil who in this hell dares suggest that she should be otherwise these attitudes only point up her perception of the situation and her healthy rejection of same maybe if our women get evil enough and angry enough theyll be moved to some action that will bring our men to their senses there is one unalterable fact that too many of our men cannot seem to face and that is we black evil ugly women are a perfect and accurate reflection of you black evil ugly men play hide and seek as long as you can and will but your every rejection and abandonment of us is only a sorry testament of how thoroughly and carefully you have been blinded and brainwashed and let it further be understood that when we refer to you we mean ultimately us for you are us and vice versa we are the women who were kidnapped and brought to this continent as slaves we are the women who were raped are still being raped and our bastard children snatched from our breasts and scattered to the winds to be lynched castrated deegoed robbed burned and deceived we are the women whose strong and beautiful black bodies were and arestill being used as a cheap labor force for miss annes kitchen and mr charlies bed whose rich black and warm milk nurtured and still nurturesthe heir to the racist and evil slavemaster we are the women who dwell in the hellhole ghettos all over this land we are the women whose bodies are sacrificed as living cadavers to experimental surgery in the white mans hospitals for the sake of white medicine we are the women who are invisible on the television and movie screens on the broadway stage we are the women who are lusted after sneered at leered at hissed at yelled at grabbed at tracked down by white degenerates in our own pitiable poverty stricken and prideless neighborhoods we are the women whose hair is compulsively fried whose skin is bleached whose nose is too big whose mouth is too big and loud whose behind is too big and broad whose feet are too big and flat whose face is too black and shiny and whose suffering and patience is too long and enduring to be believed whos just too damned much for everybody we are the women whose bars and recreation halls are invaded by flagrantly disrespectful bigoted simpering amoral emotionally unstable outcast maladjusted nymphomaniacal condescending white women in desperate and untiring search of the exceedingly outsized black penis that will be attached to the animalistic frothingatthemouthforawhitewoman strongbacked sixtyminute hot black our men we are the women who upon protesting this invasion of our privacy and sanctity and sanity are called jealous and evil and smallminded and prejudiced we are the women whose husbands and fathers and brothers and sons have been plagiarized imitated denied and robbed of the fruits of their genius and who consequently we see emasculated jailed lynched driven mad deprived enraged and made suicidal we are the women who nobody seemingly cares about who are made to feel inadequate stupid and backward and who inevitably have the most colossal inferiority complexes to be found and who is spreading the propaganda that the only free people in this country are the white man and the black woman if this be freedom then heaven is hell right is wrong and cold is hot who will revere the black woman who will keep our neighborhoods safe for black innocent womanhood black womanhood is outraged and humiliated black womanhood cries for dignity and restitution and salvation black womanhood wants and needs protection and keeping and holding who will assuage her indignation who will keep her precious and pure who will glorify and proclaim her beautiful image to whom will she cry rape the racist leaves us no doubt he is the enemy he hides behind no beautiful words of welcome while holding the door shut with his toe should we choose to physically fight governor wallace would give us no doubt as to who should be struck with the weapon he is my enemy the enemy of my children and friends and i respect his candor he keeps us awake and alert my introduction to hypocrisy and prejudice came simultaneously my father took my brothers and i each day to the catholic school in town this was before the prestige of suburban living we were farmers we were poor perhaps this is why i was drawn to another classmate who was different although i didnt think about it then i only knew that i liked her and that she liked me she didnt poke fun when the others teased me because i obviously owned only two dresses we sheltered each other when a section of the class hooted as we stated firmly that there was too a santa claus catholic universal allinclusive having broad sympathies or understanding liberal first grade in a catholic school in a kansas town we learned that god loves everyone we worship god by acts of faith hope and charity thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself man is a creature composed of body and soul and made to the image and likeness of god sister didnt mention that we loved our neighbor only if he looked just like we did we were told that charity was in part being kind to others our church had numbers on the pews a number for each family one sunday i spied my friend already seated in the pew with her family i genuflected as all good catholics do and sat with christine eight years old and we learned that we should have read between the lines our teacher a nun the principal a nun and the parish priest brought me to the office the next morning christine wasnt there but they explained to me that nice little girls did not sit with the negroes the negroes have their own pews with numbers all in the back of this catholic church all grouped together dont you want the other children to like you little girl i hated them they made me feel dirty they made me feel guilty i cried christine had never made me feel guilty even when we sometimes fought she had never made me feel dirty as we walked around the school yard with our arms about each others waists as little girls do the first lesson we were friends in the school yard and grew closer when my family later moved to town but we never again sat together in church in kansas integrated the schools it was no longer necessary for the negro children to walk many blocks passing one or two public schools to get to their own separate but equal school but the catholic parish had shown its benevolence many years before it had christine by the time we reached high school my associations had pretty well ostracized me from the white cliques but the catholic high school had made great strides here we had three negroes boys football stars we were not brave we never discussed the quirk of fate that found the four of us sharing one disguised box lunch i brought to the football banquet each year we pretended not to notice that the other girls shared theirs with only one boy a different boy each time after all the boxes were disguised no one but the nun in charge knew who was going to draw which box educate to give knowledge or training instruct to form and develop ones taste etc senior year was spent in the public school there were many more negro young people here and we talked more freely to the faculty they were very kind and understanding their indulgence in explaining that we could not use the swimming pool because it was simply too expensive to drain it every other day was above reproach there was not even a problem in electing the king and queen for the promtwo sets one negro one caucasian the instruction was as excellent in the public school as it had been in the catholic school although in retrospect notable for what we did not learn rather than for what we did learn in studying african and negro history as an adult i reproached myself many times for not having paid attention in class thereby having to wait years before realizing the beauty and pride of the great americans of african heritage until my own children were in school attention had nothing to do with it we lived several years in a white neighborhood where my children were never in a class larger than i taught them the history of the american negro that they were not receiving in school as well as the history being made with sitins bus rides and the like they are now being educated in an allnegro school with from to to a class and i no longer have to worry about the lack of history last month they studied africa they learned that the people there get drunk all the time in discussing what they had learned they thought that perhaps the men who loaded the banana boats drank a barrel of wine each night because they were frightened of the tarantulas they were far more interested however in their new knowledge of the animals cannibals no one could have asked for a finer and more intricate description of how a person is cut open and his heart attached to a stick to be burned before he is eaten perhaps they were taught other things but they and some of the other children who talked to me about this privileged course cant remember past the fascinating life of the cannibal perhaps the denver school administration will set up another council to study it llie school board is grand about setting up councils to study the problems of the negro community they dont seem to have a problem saying yes or no mostly yes to the white community but with us they set up councils education is not much of a problem however we now have remedial training courses this enables a young person once he has gone through years of overcrowded schools fantastically rapid teacher turnover antiquated books and such to go back and learn what he could have learned from the beginning given half a chance by the administration without the help of the councils committee a group of people chosen to consider some matter or function councils and committees what would the man do if it werent for the committee he would have to do of course therefore the committee several months ago members of civil_rights groups and social problem organizations went to the mayor to discuss the mounting complaint of police brutality but said the mayor we already have the internal affairs bureau investigation of police by police and the mayors committee on citycitizens relations nonpaid committee appointed by the mayor to investigate complaints after much discussion it was decided that perhaps a committee was the answer hence the community relations bureau three police officers spend a great deal of time going to school explaining what nice people policemen are and what overwhelming problems they face the iab continues to find accusations ridiculous the mcccr continues to ignore charges the crb continues their public relations drive we still hear the complaints of police brutality but what the hell could we have another committee study about policemen employ to make use of use to provide work and pay for thats just about it they make use of use and sometimes provide work but pay for thats not quite right my caustic tongue leaps ahead of real constructive thinking negroes and spanishsurnamed people gain fine jobs the federal center post office city and state commissions councils and committees each time the masses grumble some nice minority person is given another position lets hope that the government never executes a wholesale dismissal or the walls of this ghetto will swell back to bursting poverty the condition or quality of being poor indigence need there is a war on it boards are set up for it people are hired to fight it they are paid huge salaries to combat it the boards and staffs are so busy talking about what they are going to do about it that they cant find it boards must have one third of the membership comprised of the poor boards establishing poverty programs are composed of kind sensitive concerned people so they sometimes set up two boards one for the powerful and one for the indigent this saves the poor from having to worry about hiring staff business and all the appalling things the poor shouldnt have to worry about on top of being poor never mind that the war on poverty was designed to build leaders and selfdirection in the indigent communities they are too busy being poor to have the time confusing well so is the war on poverty rehabilitation in sociology to restore a dependent defective or criminal to a state of physical mental and moral health through treatment and training years ago the united states had a system of revenge in the penitentiary penancepenitentiary modern day penology no longer believes in revenge we train men and women living in penal institutions we train them to load cans of beans on shelves pick beets maintain silence or we put them on the waiting list of the more enlightening programs perhaps this is just as well the frustration of the untrained man will be less than the trained individual when he discovers that society will not allow him to complete his sentence and obtain employment no matter how learned and skilled he might be young people are no problem at all the consensus seeming to be that the graduated steps from juvenile hall to buena vista to colorado state prison are better than what he would have at home anyway once he gets to csp he can then go through the abovementioned training routine and be saved or he can gain the status of a returnee which puts him into another category and i think theres a committee to study the returnee problem news recent happenings especially those broadcast over the radio printed in a newspaper etc reports of such events living in the north one hears a vast amount of criticism concerning the atrocities of the south newspapers print the findings of committees in washington that study the problems of minorities a lot is heard about the stability of integrated park hill they even have tours of the beautiful homes there inhabited by doctors lawyers judges teachers etc we hear about other minorities in denver in crime reports other cities should educate employ house and learn from the lessons taught in farreaching areas seemingly then we have no troubles in denver this entire paragraph was wasted time excuse me lead to show the way to or direct the course of by going before or along with one would think from this definition that of necessity a leader would need something to lead our leaders dont seem to be bothered with this encumbrance the going before seems to please most of them its the along with that brings on the glassyeyed stare leaders have a conscience though surveys can do wonders for a conscience with leaders surveys take precedence over committees civil_rights in law relating to the private rights of individuals and to legal actions involving these in mrse rosa parks gave us the courage to begin a new era of revolt at least one publicized as revolt rather than riot the backlash of boycotts and freedom rides in southern communities moved some to demonstrations in the north core naacp and sncc demonstrated in denver demanding a fair housing law equal employment and so on even the most biased looked upon the negro with new respect although they claimed that this riotous behavior was pushy perhaps it was necessary for separate but equal equality we made strides and then relaxed civil_rights organizations certainly dont form councils or committees they abhor them they dont do anything about them but they abhor them oh yes they do do something they draw up philosophy and guidelines they worry a lot about riots and a great deal of time is spent talking about those people hours are spent talking about how to reach them it is amazing that they are so apathetic that they never show up at meetings set up for them in some isolated from them sterile section of the city devil something evil or bad a wicked person white devils elijah muhammad calls us and by the time his word began to be heard over the country i quite agreed most of my life has been spent in anger and resentment toward the hypocrisy of the large majority of my race times in a white community had never been comfortable i wanted my children to grow up free from the influence of the white devil so when they began to resent friends who came to visit because of the name chanting of the neighborhood young people we moved to the allnegro area where we have stayed after an initial period as paddies there was a blending that i do not feel could have been accomplished had the situation been reversed for the caucasian is taught to hate almost as he begins to breathe the look and nudge passed between parents as they notice a mixed couple eenie meenie minie moe if you

the real motives but the time has passed when i can blame mr charlie alone for the hypocrisy of human rights it is a warning my lips and heart want to violently scream as i see the negro leader who leaves his people behind in the ghetto the leader who rises up once in every meeting denounces the white man and then sits quietly until the next meeting the man who speaks eloquently but never has time for work when a nice negro is accepted into a window dressing position when civil_rights groups listen attentively to the platitudes of the white liberal who tells them they must go slow that things are better dont rock the boat the liberal who when not in the hearing of his negro friend is not quite so liberal the liberator who drags his feet as he reaches the gate the freedom lover who desires integration but not in his block the white man who is shocked as he hears discussions of violencevsnonviolence by the frustrated negro if our children are to be able to live with some semblance of harmony in the future we must face and fight these hypocrisies or we the masses will suffocate in the degradation of poverty tumult and need as we watch mr charlie and uncle tom walk hand

barricades bootstraps what youre pulling yourself up by while theyre kicking you in the there two categoj a jpa ries of individuals in ii the united states who are upset enous h at the present progress of the civil_rights revolution to call their supporters to arms the first type is the frightened fringetype white conservatives who fear their american way of life is threatened these people are arming to protect what they call their constitutional rights the second group is civil_rights workers who are arming to protect themselves from physical attacks by people usually of the first group for the first group any gain in civil_rights is too much for the second group present gains are not enough the issues on both sides center around the progress of the civil_rights movement this article will deal with considerations posed by the arming of civil_rights workers the basic strategy of whose movement has been nonviolence any examination of its progress or problems has to deal first with the basic tactic of nonviolence as a vehicle for social political and cultural revolution there are certain basics which must be taken into consideration at the outset first negroes constitute approximately per cent of the nations population second the rights that negroes seek were guaranteed them by the working of the democratic process further it was almost years after the american constitution and declaration of independence before the words set down in those two documents were considered to apply to black men these facts indicate just one thing whether we like it or not negroes are existing in the united states with these guarantees such as they are at sufferance of the white majority negroes have been in america for more than years we did the manual labor necessary for the economic growth of the country we provided the white world with the leisure time to educate itself and to progress along the paths of civilization we fought in the wars of defense of the country we gave this country its only indigenous culture and art form by any standard one would care to establish we belong here but belonging and getting what is rightfully ours are two different things to achieve the latter to fully possess our birthright we must of necessity adopt a minority underdog tactic there are just two proven tactics befitting our circumstances one is guerilla warfare the other is passive resistance nonviolence any other form of overt resistance in the face of superior numbers and resistance capacity is sheer folly ornonsense guerilla warfare is based upon several basic principles first the majority of the population must be in sympathy with the new cause because guerillas must live off the land and their hitandrun tactics are dependent upon the support of others second the confrontation with the enemy must take place at sites where the insurgents have a superior knowledge of the terrain while the opposition is ignorant of or illsuited to the surroundings third terrorism becomes an essential element of the struggle both friend and enemy must be afraid of the consequences of being set upon by the insurgent group the fact that the civil_rights movement in the united states is fatally short of the elements of guerilla warfare is so apparent as to make further consideration of this form of resistance pointless nonviolence has a long and a successful history of overcoming formidable odds in the interests of progress in ancient times perhaps the most dramatic example was the christian struggle for tolerance acceptance and dominance the christian idea was an unpopular one going to the very roots of what the majority rigidly held as sacred here is a persuasive example of a hated and feared underdog who ultimately conquered the one single factor characterizing this development was the nonviolent nature of the christians purges sadistic indignities and horrifying deaths did not alter their selected course and their strategem of passive resistance as a result of this experience it became well documented that an idea cannot be suppressed or killed with violence conversely it demonstrates that an idea cannot be furthered by force either people supplant one idea only with one they believe to be better even more pertinent is the fact that an idea cannot be protected by violence if this were the case then the lynchings killings and other crimes of southern whites would have wiped out the idea of freedom for the black man in the south thus maintaining the notion of white supremacy forever we know that this is certainly not the case there are those who believe in the cylical theory of historyhistory repeats itself whether this is a valid historical hypothesis or not one has to be impressed with the parallels between ancient rome and the united states today rome had reached a very high degree of civilization when christianity became a serious issue first there were frantic efforts at suppression of the new ideology when the atrocities and fanaticism failed to change the dedication and faith of the christians the pagan romans became impressed with the dignity and inner superiority of these new turn the other cheek christians and many were convinced that any religion which provided its followers with this type of conviction and courage had to be superior they then made this better idea their own just as the pagans of rome bowed to the superiority of a new idea so the civil_rights leaders have the same challenge offered them to demonstrate the intrinsic and innate merit of their ideas this cannot be done by looking down the barrel of a gun whether it is in defense or not because the person at the other end is not going to be impressed with anything other than the fact that he wishes he were some place else those in the movement who are advocating arms to make the distinction between defensive violence and offensive violence are in for trouble this is about as easy as trying to separate an uncle tom from a good nigger it just depends on your point of view further as rev martin_luther_king jr points out perhaps offensive and defensive violence has meaning for intellectuals but for the rest of us the line of demarcation rapidly and easily disappears in any emotional hostile confrontation perhaps one of the most succinct statements on the whole issue of black_power andor violence by a civil rightist was made by dick gregory in jackson mississippi at the conclusion of the meredith march he said to the large audience there you know what remember those atomic bombs we dropped by mistake in spain well i wish they would drop one right down here in mississippi laughter no really right here pause anlet us find it then baby we would have black_power laughter its a funny thing but the way you say black_power down here sounds like black_power to me and that scares hell out of me laughter but anyway we find this here atomic bomb an you know what we do with it then we take it right over to governor johnsons mommas house gales of laughter she looks out of the window and starts to sing you have overcome then we takes it to the white house and say to lbj hey baby we got us some black_power now and well trade it for some civil_rights laughter what gregory was obviously and truthfully getting at was the fact that unless there is an overwhelming amount of potential violence we cannot expect to gain any lasting respect or change through the use of direct violence one of the very strange paradoxes of the civil_rights leaders wanting to arm and there are several is the fact that it flies in the face of everything progressive or forward looking violence on a world scale has been effectively eliminated as a method of settling disputes furthering ideals or protecting ideas certainly there are koreas cubas viet nams and there will be others but these are local and isolated and although the threat of involvement by two large nations directly confronting each other is apparent it is highly unlikely that such an event will materialize the point is that war on a world scale has been informally diminished as a means of settling world crisis as this becomes more and more the case then the case for settlement by negotiation becomes stronger but settlement by negotiation presupposes some sort of forum debate such as the un this in turn means representative bodies at work because of the composition of the worlds peoples the majority of nations are nations of color this fact and the need of support from these countries at conferences and meetings has been one of the principal reasons for a more active role by the u s government in civil_rights our representatives were subjected to ridicule and scorn before these august bodies when they spoke of selfdetermination peoples independence democracy and other platitudes in the cold war as it is constituted now the u s simply could not afford to tolerate the senseless and undemocratic denial of negro rights this became our lever the pictures of defenseless innocent people simply petitioning for their rights and being set upon with dogs clubs and water hose were the fulcrum of the lifting up of negro rights before the world make no mistakethe essential element was the fact that these people were without question free of evil or sinister motives it was without doubt the fact that they were acting in good faith and good will introduce the element of arms be they for defense or offense and a diminution and dilution of the image takes place to advocate arming is to preach directly against the dictates of the lessons of history and contemporary common sense in a word it is nonsense we cannot however depend upon the governments concern for world opinion to continue to carry the bulk of civil_rights progress we have had government charity before it was just a years ago when negroes were feeling the first flush of freedom as the result of the norths suppression of the souths campaign to secede just as northern punishment of the south then was based more on vindictiveness than on moral commitment so when the time was expedient for the government to forget its charity it did so and the negro was suppressed more fiercely than before history has demonstrated that we cannot expect any sustained windfalls we must press on and convince the white united states that complete civil_rights is the only acceptable posture for the negro further we must illustrate to the power structure black and white that the alternative to progressive civil_rights is something totally unacceptable to them in other words it must be positively manifested to the respective power structures that it is in their best interest to continue to press for complete and full civil_rights if we are going to depend principally upon indigenous domestic pressures to maintain the civil_rights momentum then it becomes imperative that we have certain negroes who are capable and dedicated by circumstance of maintaining the pressure in a very real sense we have a need for neonecessary negroes the traditional necessary negro was the one who sat by the door as you came into an otherwisewhite office he was the especially invited black at select social gatherings just as the white power structure needs necessary negroes so does the black_power structure need neonecessary negroes to explain further let us repeat the well established point that power has the tendency to do two things first it corrupts second it makes its possessor conservative the neonecessary negro keeps pressure on the black_power structure to keep pressure on the white power structure an example of this in operation is the fact that the one black man most responsible for the successes of rev martin_luther_king jr was malcolm_x malcolm_x did two things to and for dr_king he kept king honest in a word he kept him on his toes second malcolm_x astonished frightened and coerced a number of powerful white and black people into supporting king as the lesser of two evils these people saw in king an acceptable alternative to the kind of philosophy malcolm_x was advocating the result was that kings position and prestige were enhanced immeasurably no amount of black money could have bought this kind of support it was only through the fear generated by malcolm_x the original neonecessary negro that dr_king was able to insure for himself acceptance by the national and international power structures as leader of the civil_rights movement with malcolm_x gone and the civil_rights movement even more in need of neonecessary negroes than before we have a new breed of militant negroes coming forth with frightening way out ideas the rallying cry for this new breed is black_power like most new slogans and oversimplifications black_power has almost as many different meanings as there are people who care to define it there are certain notions common to most responsible definitions though usually there is an emphasis on the negros effective utilization of his political potential in addition there is usually a call for negroes to support black business and in general to think in terms of separation to the emerging militant leaders who depend on militancy as their sustaining virtue and who must come up with more sensational radical doctrines the term black_power very literally means black fire power its a common occurrence that neophytes must be more of whats popular in order to get their foot in the door and compete with the incumbents the civil_rights movement is no different the new breed must come up with more excitingsounding slogans in order to gain a following and push the older mellowing leaders aside that the neonecessary negroes play an important function in the long range success of civil_rights is not disputed here what is at issue is the fact that the more militant violenceoriented leaders are advocating policies which are historically strategically and logistically unfeasible and absolute nonsense that these men as long as they are a definite minority are essential to the progress of the nonviolent tactic for civil_rights is readily admitted the civil_rights movement is going toward the gray areas the fact that the federal government is nominally supporting civil_rights the fact that the president actively calls for an end to discrimination and the fact that each new legislative session brings new and better laws on the subject all point to one thing the opposition to civil_rights posing the most formidable challenge is the subtle elusive form which lies ahead no longer will there be an exact and well defined delineation but vivid lines of demarcation will give way to amorphous boundaries of gray a little more than years ago the united states undertook to defeat the gray of america and was successful if the nonviolent and the neonecessary negroes continue to unwillingly supplement and complement each other we can do it again perhaps there is something to the cyclical theory of history after all his name was colored boyr and he lived in the slums in the very heart of a huge black ghetto his wife was the negro cook and his children were simply known as those people and like his father before him and his father before that and n indeed as all of his forefathers who had ever walked in this hostile land h had no rights he was reminded of this fact daily as he watched his wife wearily making her way to the affluent suburbs where she toiled for coolie wages and he was vividly aware of this fact as he himself made his way to yet another suburb where he slaved for wages similar to those paid his wife and he knew this beyond a shadow of a doubt when he saw his children returning home day after day year after year from their ancient dilapidated school with no books no homework and no hope he was the handyman in a huge gleaming ultramodern supermarket which never ceased to amaze him everything worked there the food carts moved with only the slightest touch there were none of those rusty threewheeled numbers which abounded in his neighborhood and there were always plenty of cashiers who smiled and who indeed acted as if they truly believed the customer was always right but the most incredible phenomena of all were the products which were not only of the finest quality but were so beautiful to look at until he often felt it was almost a sin to take money for working in such a showplace of beauty the meats were a succulent vibrant red and the fruits and vegetables were so fresh looking until he was certain they grew right there in their bins and there were never any bent cans on the shelves or busted packages which seemed to form the very foundation of the markets in his forlorn neighborhood of course hed worked on the job several years now and he knew what happened when the meats grew tired and the vegetables drooped and the fruits turned brown from overripeness some of it was given to him here boy you take this home if you want and he wanted taking it home in two used slightly soiled shopping bags which he kept handy for such occasions but most of the used and abused goods were loaded onto a huge truck in the hush of night and shipped out to other neighborhoods where the stores did not gleam and the cashiers snarled and worked terribly slow and acted as if they believed the motley illclad customers were intruders and the most amazing part of all however was what happened to the prices apparently as meats grew older their value increased for those tired steaks in his district were always at least ten cents higher than they were when they sparkled in that gleaming store in that golden suburb he had not been born here in this city of concrete and noise dirt and heat toil and loneliness he had come from down yonder seeking a better different life than that of his father who had only endured with the aid of the pint bottle for ever lodged in the hip pocket of his worn overalls he had come here a young man filled with hope and great expectations thinking he had at last found a new land that wanted him as much as he wanted to belong but somehow that very same day of his arrival those men in blue had spied his jaunty step had sensed his hopeful spirit and had backed him up against a wall searching his pockets poking his ribs and reminding him once and for all that he had not gone anywhere at all down yonder was all over wherever he went and he must learn to live with that fact if he wanted to live at all and so quietly inch by inch day by day he finally died before his marriage he had not minded too much the haunting image of death that followed him night and day he had learned to live with it as man has always learned to live with whatever hells he finds surrounding him but when he met another as vulnerable as once he had been he yearned to warn and protect her from the inevitable tortures that lay ahead and his situation became intolerable and he began wearing the pint bottle in his hip pocket in the manner of his father and his fathers father then they were married and the children came and he became the handyman and his wife became the cook and they watched their two children destined for nowhere as such children are always fated to end and once again the process of dying became his daily bread his wife had hope still and a sense of humor at times and always she tried to stand her ground against adversity which came in many ways in many shapes and in many colors whenever they happened to trade at their dingy overcrowded market for staples which were often misshappen or otherwise flawed and were always at least five cents higher than those in his golden supermarket his wife never let anyone slip ahead of them no matter how small the number of packages they held she merely shook her head and winked slightly line baby she would then add nodding toward the rear their children when very small had been his one remaining source of joy and his little girl now only nine still adored him but his son had just turned and had learned the score and now no longer met his fathers eyes you have this camera and this here transitor he would accuse feeling the quality of the items as only a man who owns cheap goods can feel the fineness in that which is not cheap you got em from th boy down th street where did he get em and the silence and then the shrug but never the meeting of the eye as the eyes of father and son should meet take them back the mother would command and then she would proceed to stare her son down while his father walked away to his room to squint nervously at the remains of his pint bottle and an ineffable sadness would settle over him for he knew that one day his daughter too would learn the score and would no longer rush to greet him in the evening when he came through the door and it became a nightmare that followed him to work now and made him want to do strange things as he did the day he saw the blonde woman with her two blonde children rosy wellfed and welldressed and running their cart over him as they always did but this day he grabbed the cart and was about to ram it into those three sparkling people when someone called to him and brought him back to earth he turned in time to see one of the boys he worked with only they were really boys eighteen or nineteen but nobody called them boys they had names and white faces come on the boy urged we need th mop somebody spilled something and he took his mop and went to clean up the mess as he was told to do then there came the time just before he was about to leave early on his halfday off with his two soiled shopping bags laden with flawed goods when he saw the lady in line her soft white hand clutching a wad of green bills not fives or tens but twenties and fifties and even a couple of hundreds and he stood mesmerized his eyes glued to the bills then suddenly he felt himself reaching out to clutch the hand when the floor manager bumped into him and snapped sharply take your broom and git the hell out the way boy and he took his mop and bucket and got the hell out the way as he was told to do and soon he made his weary way back to his prison where the gray invisible walls rose up to meet him as he came out of the subway his two shopping bags weighing him down like the eternal burden that he carried on his back his black skin and his haunted heritage in a land which banished him to an everlasting terror which people often called the ghetto but today a different feeling seemed to pervade the place true the air as usual hung hot and humid laced with the odors of worn out men and women and their innumerable discards which no longer were even capable of delighting the rats then he was made aware of an unnatural silence which banged against his head like an overthrown baseball and he came to a dead standstill wondering for a moment if he had somehow wandered into a strange part of town but then as he stood there peering about in that uncertain fashion which had long been his habit now the silence was shattered as a group of children saw his burdened figure and started running toward him shouting his name which almost no one bothered to use any more then they were upon him all talking at once each eager to be the one who got his story across first it was a total jumble for a moment but then two words leaped out and grabbed him his son was shot why why he clutched a squirming child who who the men in blue he was running running running but children were always running yes but not his children they should walk crawl and be searched standing against the brick wall their ribs poked by a sinister stick their laughter stilled upon their youthful lips where where is he the hospital hours ago with a man in blue standing at the door turning everyone away even the local minister and a white priest were not allowed to enter the hospital is blocks away and his shoes are worn and his feet are ruined but he rushes there neither his feet nor his shopping bags burdening him down any longer down the long silent corridor so like the somber areas in all his nightmares past all the battered doors hiding their suffering inhabitants enfolding them in their halfworld of pain and sorrow he made his way numb with four centuries of agony waiting to overwhelm him the door is open the man in blue is gone and so is his songone where and silence greets him but does not touch him for his numbness is total there is nothing left now he turns and leaves by a side door still carrying his soiled shopping bags which have now become a part of his body flawed and irrelevant he moves on down the street but the children finally see him and rush to surround him with endless questions however he does not hear them nor does he see them he merely walks down the street in his shabby shoes and limp gray shirt and tattered blue trousers and he walks and walks and the children following him increase in number and grow larger in size and finally men and women are following him also and it becomes a parade as still more people join from block to block and someone starts singing and soon they are all singing all except him who leads the way and no longer sees or hears and on and on they move until hes finally confronted with the men in blue who call to him in their usual way hey boy what you got in them bags come here let us see and once again he does as he was told to do he lets them see but suddenly his mauled fist streaks through the air meeting the big red chin of the man in blue then all at once the air is filled with mauled fists as the men women and children who now surround him follow his action and the singing grows louder and the mauled fists fill the air and bedlam is everywhere now he begins to sing as feeling comes back to him again and he strikes and strikes and strikes he regains consciousness several days later wrapped like a mummy in a hospital room his body filled with pain and he hears his affluent countrymen calling him savage and irresponsible but there is hope in heart for now no one was calling him boy a couturier in manhattan has adapted the african look to high fashions and is dressing such stylesetters as baby jane holzer in eyecatching little numbers which might seem comme it faut on the streets of dakar or lagos and over in chicago a pair of deepbrown lassies have opened a boutique called appropriately enough the african look well it isnt the new rage just yet the ebony fashion fair for instance hasnt gotten around to noticing that ladies of african descent have a natural flair for the flowing robes and brilliant colors but there is hope a couple of the european designers are hungup on the elegant feminine version of the boubou and where the great couturiers go the fashion fair cannot be far behind sooner or later even the society femmes de couleur are bound to discover how graceful and yes seductive a sarilike robe can be trailing across a salon or a ballroom floor meanwhile the movement among the men seems to be pretty well established and as is clearly evident on these pages with engaging results if the african look does catch on here then the afroamericans might succeed in reselling it to some of the africans back in its july issue time magazine published maliciously one suspects a photo of a lineup of congolese officials receiving medals from their president in all that heat the good gentlemen

were more consideratewe only quarrel with those who deny that his is one of the more beautiful voices of our time what has come to be called the mathis magic is once again available on the mercury release the shadow of your smile excepting the title song with its nauseating arrangement the album is filled with the immaculate phrasing marvelous breath control and the fantastic rangefrom near falsetto to deep baritoneof the man george avakian once described as having four voices some of the tunes such as michelle im in love for the very first time and i left my heart in san francisco are handled really well but others are absolutely fabulous his rendition of the haunting yesterday leaves one involved in the songs drama and his craftsmanship is remarkable on the exciting somethings coming from west side story on a clear day you can see forever is tailormade for the romantic style of mathis and one shares with him a certain joy on a fun song called come back to me which finds mathis unusually ethnic and inspires the listener to rise and do what the spirits says do as usual there is a number included which affords mathis the chance to journey beyond the beyond he comments that in a song he looks for that intangible value that distinguishes something as being out of the ordinary a taste of honey remember morgana is such a song and mathis is such a singerdlin a very real sense the new wave in jazz impulse is a microcosm of jazz history simultaneously recalling the idioms turbulent past and opening doors to what may be the dominant theme in jazzs future for the next several decades many followers will easily recall the transition period of the forties when a group of young experimenters named john birks dizzy gillespie theolonius monk charles yardbird parker max roach and charles mingus and maybe a few others were toying with a brand new kind of jazz improvisation they called bop after a period of heated controversy about the merits of the new music bop and the other forms it influenced became a respectable and accepted school of learning for jazzmen now comes a set of latterday experimenterstenor men john coltrane archie shepp albert ayler altoists marion brown james spaulding trumpeters ashley fennell donald ayler and charles tolliver drummers billy higgins bill harris and roger blank and otherswho are introducing another radical step in jazz improvisation the album contains five numbers recorded at the village in new york city for the benefit of the black arts repertory theatre in harlem at that time headed by leroi jones this thrill and mystify new black music as jones calls it is completely free of any distinguishable at least to the layman listener melody and almost totally departs from all previous musical forms it combines a strange maybe exotic many times exasperating set of whaling squeaky droning and pounding sounds which leave most of us confused groping for something identifiable according to what we have been taught as western music therein lies our error this is not western music this is black music all of these musicians would probably welcome the label black nationalist not because each of them is ready to take to the streets and put the torch to all of western civilization but because they are swept up in the current racial upheaval that finds the black man searching for an identity that is not western but african jones explains you hear on this record poets of the black nation albert ayler in his liner notes tells us the creators of the new music have reached deep into their psyches deep into their cultural origins to find a language of sound that conveys this sense of the world as feeling as knowledge found through the logic of the emotions and truly its the emotions and not the logic of sound that is at work here coltrane together with drummer elvin jones bassist jimmy garrison and pianist mccoy tyner will you on nature mathis boy the ayler brothers on holy ghost trombonist grachan moncur on blue free shepp co on hambone and tolliver and spaulding on brilliant corners will leave you with either a sense of bewilderment as to what they are trying to say or with an esthetic attachment that has deep roots in the black mans determined drive to shed every vestige of the white mans cultural influencefrancis ward naomi long madgetts third book of poems star by star harlo press shows a progression in technique and a widening in themes reviewing her previous book one and the many saunders redding called her a natural poet she has a remarkably keen ear and not only uses the traditional forms with grace but invents new forms and uses the difficult though apparently easy free verse with skill redding was probably referring to her metrical ease as shown in quest which reprinted with a number of other poems from her previous volume has the haunting melodic quality of verlaineanother outstanding reprint is midway which has been widely quoted and misquoted the long lines have the swinging rhythm of a march with its concrete images and biblical vocabulary familiar to everyone who has heard an oldtime preacher it may one day be set to music and used as a secular hymn ive come this far to freedom hese words crescendo to a climax of sound and not by the forced devices of italics or of all capital letters but by the syntax the rhythm the meaning and the gradual shift of vowels across the gamut from the short i of whispered to the broad a of walk the longest and most complex section of the book is trinity a dream sequence a love poem in nineteen sections although uneven it is rewarding in its allusiveness there are echoes not unpleasant of emily dickinson in destiny and star journey and of frost in woman with flower but for all her metrical skill her phrasing is weak the book has shopworn images and vague poetic terms like dreams one reflects on how emily dickinson would write twelve or fifteen synonyms on her manuscript in a search for the precise nuance and how dylan mrs culver explains in her preface that poems about black heroes are needed to give black children a favorable selfimage and to acquaint white children with the accomplishments of black people the range of heroes in this book extends from crispus attucks the revolutionary war martyr to the freedom riders and james meredith the book closes with a poem called my brotherion coupled with the forced interest that the civil_rights movement carries have turned out literal mountains of materials about the race question in this constant parade of material one can find all types and tones but one of the most gratifying kinds of works is that by legitimate scholars often these books are dry with facts almost always they are the products of reasoned thinking based upon extensive research the very good ones are the result of excellent minds skilled in research techniques that can set the findings down in interesting and readable style arthur waskows from race riot to sitindoubleday co is an excellent example of this last category arthur waskow in addition to bringing skills intelligence and interest to the subject matter carries with him something of an overview he is a man of broad interests and his previous books carried the titles the limits of defense and the worried mans guide to world peace waskow could be called an internationalist if we were looking for easy titles but more accurately he is a very bright man who is concerned with the problems that confront us race is one of those problems and one of the phenomena of race in america is the evolution of tactics and manifestations of unrest mr waskow has done a professional and thorough job of tracing this development from to the s with all the fuss going on these days about whether things negroid should be so labeled one would think langston hughes is in danger of being called a racial separatist for editing the book of negro humor dodd mead co thats what it isnegro humor not a foolish mixture of chinese jokes or irish ditties or eskimo party breakers to vindicate the sanctity of the american melting pot this page collection of jokes funny poems and stories downhome tales humorous remembrances and pure sidesplitting comedy come from every segment of negro life it is us baby from the black preacher on sunday in the pulpit to the harlem card shyster from unheralded unknowns like effie lee newsome and robert a johnson to renowned spokesmen for the brother like hughes himself james weldon johnson and martin_luther_king jr come many precious and memorable morsels of good humor and fun thats one of the good things about this book hughes sort of a selftaught specialist on the life and times of black men from his native missouri to harlem realizes that to capture the gaiety and wholesome spontaneity of negro humor he had to go to the sourceto dozens of black men and women themselves plain people who at some juncture in their ives had something funny to say not that hughes does not draw freely from the masters paul laurence dunbar johnson zora neal hurston godfrey cambridge arna bontemps as well as his own writings a witty line thorny subtlety or tickling poem or tale from one or all of them crops up constantly through out the book however its great strength lies in hughes ability to comprehensively reflect the everyday happenings of black existence in the melting pot by drawing on the recollections of so many people from so many walks of life also of worth is the editors ability to draw togetherunder general headings like cool comics or jokes and jivesome of the best from oldtimers like jazzmen w c handy jelly roll morton comedians pigmeat markham and mantan moreland and to fuse them with clarity and consistency with the offerings of more recent writers or folklorists such as leroi jones james baldwin roi ottley john o killens and dan burley as one would naturally expect since it has been the central fact of the black mans life for nearly years in america the race issue is treated by numerous contributors with different messages and varying degrees of wit bitterness and folksiness seldom if ever does anybody wear off into the wilds of unrestrained racialism on the other hand whitey doesnt get off without being reminded of his injustices hughes cambridge dick gregory ottley and other lesser names make sure of that besides having the supremely beneficial effect of entertaining readers by making them laughat themselves and the world outsidethis fine collection of writings has one other salutary plus to its credit it allows negroes to laugh at their frailties and foibles without the spectre of thinking they are supporting societys stereotype of the nonthinking grinning headscratcher some of the stereotypes are taken out of character laughed at then forgotten about without any notice of a supposed larger meaning even ancient movie performer it would be misleading to say actor mantan moreland is allowed a brief space in hughes democracy of comedy and witticisms without the slightest hint of morelands white teeth big eyes and round sweaty black face attributes which did more than a lions share in the s and s to perpetuate the white mans myth about the small size of the negros brain francis ward southerner lippincott by congressman charles longstreet weltner is the honest revelation of a southerner by birth northern in education and right on the masondixon line as far as civil_rights and social relationships are concerned it could just as aptly have been entitled anatomy of advance because congressman weltner does represent an advance over his congressional predecessors from atlanta georgia it perhaps would have been a more apt title because his views are certainly not those of the general white south and anything in the present title to suggest that the contents do reflect the general opinions of the white southerner is misleading congressman weltner manifests many of the traits possessed by a few intelligent and ambitious men of the new south these men are able to see the turn of the tide of social and political forces they can count they can add and they can analyze these are realists pragmatists and moderates these capacities all tend to demonstrate to them that the south will no longer be able to function politically unless the negro is considered as a factor of vital and integral importance this is not to suggest that men like congressman weltner are becoming liberal it is not to infer that they are irrevocably dedicated to openmindedness on the race issue it is only to state that they are willing to do the right thing so long as it is practical feasible and fairly safe congressman weltner makes a fair statement of the doctrine of the southern moderate as a southerner it was hard for me to contemplate the changes that were being sought but as an american i knew that manifest wrongs to a substantial number of the nations people required a remedy the remedy for congressman weltner was the law his feelings about race and the solution to the manifest wrongs to a substantial number of the nations people is to fall in line with the law this makes no demand on his sense of morality or ethics on the race question however obeying the law is really just the beginning of the solution but it is a start and men like weltner are appearing with some regularity in the south they are an interesting breed and one of them writing about himself with honesty makes interesting readingbrooks johnsonyou have heard it from other sources white people have heard it too when martin_luther_king jr says oppression is just as damaging to the oppressor as to the oppressed many people shrug and think he is attempting to win greater support for his cause the bare truth is that those who stand by mute and allow the rights of others to be destroyed are paving the way for the capricious denial of their own rights hodding carters so the heffners left mccomb doubleday is another of a series of books illustrating this truth there are a number of books from the south written by those of the white race who have had their own damaging personal brush with the race issue most of these people were not liberals or radicals they were guilty only of sympathy tolerance and quasichristianity to the rest of the south this deviation from the cracker line is heresy and retribution is swift crude and effective the heffners are what we have come to think of as being in the mississippi tradition she physically attractive as the mississippi beauty queens have been he the white delta look of many of the middle class ambitious men of the south in most ways they were like their neighbors active in segregated community affairs but somewhere along the line they had the decency to talk in their home with some white civil_rights workers one a minister for this they were literally forced out of their state ostracized and forced to sell their home they were denied their rights just as effectively as many negroes have been denied their birthright the story of how this was accomplished is interesting and well told but the real value lies in the fact that perhaps as a result more people will better understand martin_luther_king jr when he says oppression knows no color oppression and oppressor alike are stripped of their dignity and rights or as john donne said long ago no man is an island we are all involved in all of what happens to all of mankindbrooks johnson the value of an anthology is that it brings together the best poems or a group of poems on a certain subject or introduces new poems or new poets ordinarily such a book as langston hughess bilingual la poesie negro americaine editions seghers n p would not be of interest to american readers for since it is the first fullscale anthology of black american poets in french the compiler need only have repeated the selections of previous american anthologies however mr hughes has made enough fresh additions to make this book of value to american readers the selection from m b tolson is an example in three previous anthologies the editors used only his dark symphony a choice which helped to prevent this excellent poet from being more widely known as there were other more recent and better poems of his available but in this book mr hughes has included a section from tolsons libretto for the republic of liberia in an amusing footnote the editor states that tolsons language was impossible to translate and the english alone is given a large part of the book which ranges from phillis wheatley to david henderson is given to newer poets those who have one or more poems which cling to the memory are julia fields bob kaufman ray durem leroi jones conrad kent rivers raymond patterson g c oden oliver lagrone mari evans james a emanuel lucy smith and worth long the harlem renaissance poets are generously represented with both standard anthology pieces and lesser known work the poems from poets who emerged in the forties are repeats from earlier anthologies but the selections from robert hayden gwendolyn brooks and margaret walker can bear repeating margaret danner has the short piece best loved of africa it is interesting to see what the translators alain bosquet sim copans jean copans francois dodat and jean wagner did with american slang and negro dialect they made no effort to duplicate the meters or to transform them into a french equivalent their translations are literal word for word line for line erwin a salks a laymans guide to negro history quadrangle paperback is a reasonably comprehensive guidebook to information on negro history including phonograph records film strips and reference sources as well as books and magazines as an illustration of the books range there are pages devoted to negro inventors the book deserves a place on all collectors lists jerry cohen and william s murphy have writen a book entitled burn baby burn dutton and co no one who followed the los angeles riots of last year will need to be told the significance of those three words they were the rallying cry and the slogan for the black people in the watts area of la who discovered black_power and were determined to use it to eradicate the presence of everything white in their area the aftermath of black_power on the rampage was people killed injured buildings damaged buildings completely destroyed and material lost in the amount of million dollars the real loss is yet to come the watts riot proved something to the black people of watts and everywhere else under certain circumstances they can literally take over unfortunately watts has not proven very much to the white power structure in the big cities they still deal and perhaps even believe in the old platitudes and archaic theories about race the real repercussions will be felt when the cold reality of black_power interacts negatively against white naivete racial ignorance and neglect and prejudice then will come a fuller more horrible realization of the meaning and the significance of watts burn baby burn is an interesting book because the authors have been painstaking researchers concerning the causes and the consequences of the riots no one person at the scene is likely to have been aware of everything that was going on in that unlikely looking ghetto nevertheless i think the authors understand the basic elements which went into the making of the riot which so upset los angeles smug narcissuslike attitude about race however they also demonstrate some of the symptoms of the ills of the white com munity as a whole which is fine let me elaborate and say that i was there at the time of the riots and visited the watts area during the days of uneasy peace and the nights when the only security clearance was a black skin there was something strangely exhilarating about being black and the fact that being black was the preferential way to be a symbol of securityliterally my salvation the feeling of pride was present even though i was sickened by some of the things i saw taking place the absolute wanton destruction the impulsive violence the irrationality of much that was happening all astonished me but that feeling of unity based upon something that had never before had such a valuea black skinwas also an astonishing experience the authors have captured some of this feeling and i believe it frightened them as it did other whites in the area who understood what was happening for a short time in those few blocks the world as they knew it turned upside down their skins were no longer taken for granted it was no longer a badge of superiority respect and preference to paraphrase the psalm we were black and beautiful oh ye daughters of los angeles the white world was isolated in a furious black world trying to extract its pound of flesh from whitey perhaps it is this fear which obstructs the objectivity of messrs cohen and murphy or perhaps it is the remnant of an atavistic prejudice but in their honest attempt to be impartial factual and dispassionate there are several slips the authors make a point of the hate literature which cropped up at the time of the riot one piece in particular concerns police chief parker in their emphasis on the fact that these leaflets stirred up trouble the authors neglect to give any consideraion to the possible veracity of the material a statement attributed to parker in the leaflets and reproduced over his photograph this man says you commit more crime and violence than anyone else was made by parker the leaflet further reads per cent of those arrested by parkers cops are released without trial but still have arrest records result job discrimination the truth of this and it is true is not discussed by cohen and murphy but the inflammatory nature of the remarks themselves is this demonstrates the principal failing of the white man in his attempt to work out the race problem despite his good intentions and his desire to be fair he still sees the negative aspects of the negroes action before he begins to deal with or even recognize the shortcomings and mistakes of his own world read burn baby burn and discover watts again shakespeare said all the worlds a stage for the late dr melville j herskovits all the world was a laboratory this no doubt sounds like a remarkable statement fine dr herskovits was truly a remarkable man he was perhaps americas premier africanist more than that he was a scholar of immense proportions he was a man who had little tolerance for lethargy be it individual or national he was a democrat in the very finest sense of the word his friends included the president of the united states and numerous heads of state some of whom were former pupils of his as a result he was not impressed with titles but with worth and everyone who came in contact with him was judged on that basis with his death in a dimness came over the area of african studies because he took with him his invaluable ideas notions theories and facts which he had accumulated over more than years of observing in his world laboratory as his constant companion associate and a scholar in her own right no one is better equipped to edit and anthologize selected works of dr herskovits than frances s herskovits his wife editor of the new world negro indiana press the new world negro focuses on the idea that a great deal of understanding of one culture african could be garnered by studying another culture afroamerican sounds rather strange that one can be some thousands of miles and years removed from the original culture and by observing and evaluating the activities mores and customs of descendants of that culture discover substantive truths about another all of this while the descendants are intricately interwoven in a new culture if the hypothesis is startling then the proof offered by dr herskovits is astounding the new world negro is an absolute must to anyone who expects to have a basic understanding of the relationship between the old world culture of africa and the afroamerican culture of today further it is an excellent example of what a fertile imaginative mind coupled with singular scholarship can produce at twice the price the book is still one of the best book buys available almost at the same an army serand a young entered room the and geant negro mens walked toward the shoe shine stand just beyond the door the sergeant was a step ahead and as he climbed up to the chair the youth turned aside and began to wash and shave in one of the wash bowls at the end of the room thats a lot of fruit salad you got on your chest sir the negro attendant said yeah i won

from brushes to the polishing cloth he developed a rhythm like the click of train wheels punctuating it with stacatto snaps of the cloth he bent over the shoes a virtuoso of rhythm rhythm possessed his whole body he rocked from side to side his buttocks began to wag to and fro in the intensity of his rhythm as if on cue the bystander goosed him he leaped into the air and burst into a frantic dance but he still kept his rhythm his feet drumming the floor in a wild beat his eyes bugging oh dont do that dont do that im sensitive the soldier rocked with laughter the attendant resumed shining his shoes but kept glancing fearfully over his shoulder until the shirtsleeved man sauntered out he gave the cloth a final snap all done sir he said the soldier stepped down smiled at the reflection

forgot i say i kill my suds slade walks away i get up and says goodnight the couple and slade says goodnight and go out into the hawk hoping i meet no paddies before tomorrow morning it was hot that sum t mer mostly muggy jl with w n rom the lake but it had cooled qff the day be fore the sun was shining few clouds in the sky the birds were singing a perfect sunday for a wedding i woke up early cooked breakfast washed the dishes and read the sunday papers and told myself that i wasnt nervous and not counting the hours until the ceremony i busied myself with things id been putting off and after awhile it was time to get dressed i laid everything out shined my shoes and showered and shaved i started to get a drink before i left thought better of it went outside got into the car turned on the radio and drove out into the sunshine and clouds and the birds singing most of the things even now are very clear but i cant remember a thing that was playing on the radio i parked the car and went into the lobby and down the stairs the reception was in the basement of a neighborhood hotel in a room they rented for small parties and banquets and receptions they had hired a combo three pieces piano bass and guitar and i could hear the music soft and very pretty as i went down the stairs her father was standing by the door and i spoke and we shook hands and chatted and i turned while we spoke of the pennant race and watched her passing out wedding cake she had very dark hair and her skin was rather tawny and she had a tan and her skin made a very nice contrast with the white lace her teeth were very white in her face as she smiled at people and every now and then she would bite the corner of her lip which means shes listening very closely to what you were saying and she would nod her head and the teeth would release her lip and then the smile i walked over and stood in line and she saw me then and smiled and when i got to the head of the line i shook bobs hand and congratulated him and wished them luck and it was only later when i was talking to her sister and wondering where to put the cake that i remembered that id forgotten to kiss the bride the combo started a number she used to like and i walked over and spoke to her mother and then walked back and said goodbye to her and went outside and drove home i took off my suit and hung it up and put on some shorts and went outside and began washing the car and i didnt get drunk i had done that the night she told me she was going to get married and i figured once was enough the student nonviolent coordinating committees unbudging determination to work out the black mans problem in the black mans way has provoked a strange response from the white side of the tracks suddenly there are uneasy stories about an ominous black nationalism in the south and when stokely carmichael snccs new chairman turned down an invitation to the white house conference on civil_rights this action is suddenly judged to be a new hard line just what does the white man want for a century he urged the negro to stay in his place but now when the negro says all right thats just what ill do and ill make it a better place to behe is called a black nationalist the difference between a negros staying in his place and black nationalism is only a degree of temper the former is servile the latter is angry thats the only difference and the whites might as well admit it when they complain about black nationalism theyre not complaining about anything new but now they are tacitly admitting fear of it and that is new as for snccs refusal to suffer more talk about civil_rights action it does not really seem so radical the school integration decision has been the law of the land for years and less than five per cent of the negroes of the south are attending integrated schools the civil_rights act has been on the books for two years and negroes are still beaten when they try to buy food in public restaurants the voting rights act has been on the books for a year and federal registrars still have not been sent for example to sen james eastlands home county despite frequent pleas for their assistance totting up the need for action snccs impatience with more talk may be tactically unwise but it is surely understandable

problems and prospects by frederick oneal or a number of years negroes were not allowed to perform on the legitimate stage in america negro characters were played by white actors in blackface down through the years casting patterns in the various entertainment media have changed to some extent but not very much during the period roughly between and negro stars such as bert williams and others were spotted in white shows as if they were so super special that they had to be shown in almost wholly unrelated roles and mostly alone they were just the darlingest quaintest oddest most interesting sexiest most exotic or in other words just about the best thing in the show but not really a part of it the most common method of handling the negro actor in the straight play was to cast him exclusively in socalled negro roles which inevitably meant in some servile capacity such as the maid butler cook etc let it be clearly understood here that there is nothing wrong with servant and comedy roles per se the criticism stems from the characterization presentation and interpretation of these parts which until recently took the form of lazy shuffling characters speaking a dialect that even negroes had never heard the types of roles played by negroes are more of a barometer than the number of these roles the negro actor feels that he is grossly discriminated against in the casting of shows in all of the entertainment media surely his talents could have been used in many parts in a manner that would not have distorted the artistic concept of the production indeed in many instances it would have enhanced such values it would seem that negroes and orientals are the only groups whose roles are circumscribed by race the irish actor can play a japanese character the jewish actor can play the indian german actors play italian characters and vice versa but the negro actor only has a chance of being cast if the part specifically indicates negro the imagination of the agent casting director play director playwright or manager preoccupied with timeworn casting patterns does not extend beyond the racially designated description in the manuscript but these same individuals have no difficulty whatsoever with their imaginations when it comes to the selection of perhaps a david wayne for the part of the japanese character sakini in teahouse of the august moon or of jeff chandler as an american indian now all of this may sound strange and contradictory when we realize that by and large people of the theater have been opposed to discrimination segregation and other forms of bigotry and hypocrisy actors equity association is the union which has jurisdiction over those actors dancers and singers who work in the legitimate theatre the council its governing body includes seven negro members and one officer among the seventytwo members for almost twenty years equity and the league of new york theatres the organization of theatrical producers have worked in cooperation with other elements inside as well as outside the theatre community to make this area of entertainment free and healthy the league equity the dramatists guild and other organizations and individuals have on more than one occasion joined together to defeat the threat of official censorship during the dark days of mccarthyism the antiblacklist committee in actors equity working with the league managed to keep the theatre relatively free from political persecution and the principle of guilt by association as a result of this kind of cooperative effort the theatre has remained the most free of all entertainment media while being ever mindful of its collective and individual responsibility and obligation to the public served in the mid s washington d c was one of the most lucrative stops on the touring theatre circuit but the management of the national theatre in that city maintained a policy of racial discrimination the league and equity pleaded with the management to drop this vicious and immoral policy and when this request was refused these two organizations together with members of the dramatists guild decided to refuse bookings in this or any other theatre in washington until such time as the management could see fit to change this policy this was in the national theatre remained closed for the next five years while touring shows played the gayety theatre a former vaudeville house that had dropped this discriminatory policy the national was finally remodeled and redecorated under a new management and reopened in with a welcome to all races and nationalities on a completely nondiscriminatory basis inasmuch as washington was just about the most segregated city in the united states at that time perhaps it was this collective action that broke the dam of prejudice and bigotry releasing the first wave of such changes that have taken place in that city since it was a healthy action that could only terminate in a wholesome result since by contractual agreement equity does not permit its members to work in any theatre where segregation and discrimination are practiced inquiries are often made of the union as to the number of negroes there are among its members due to the fact that the racial background of members is not indicated in the unions records no one actually knows some say a thousand or more others maintain that the figure is much lower equitys ethnic minorities committee has made an unofficial effort to determine the number of negro members of the union by inquiry among members both negro and white as to their knowledge of all negro actors known to them as members of equity after examining a number of lists submitted we found a great deal of duplication but from this somewhat unorthodox method we learned that the figure is around there may be negro artists who are members of other performing unions such as american guild of musical artists american federation of television and radio artists american guild of variety artists and screen actors guild actors equitys jurisdiction is only over those actors singers and dancers who perform on the legitimate stage in the united states and canada such jurisdiction also includes some industrial shows a few night club shows musical theatres summer stock etc each year many young negro and white actor hopefuls knock on the doors of producers they all look forward to a successful career in the theatre many inquire as to the chances for such success such chances vary somewhat according to the individual but on the whole they are pretty much the same for whites as for negroes except that the chances of those of high visibility are diminished or complicated by the existence of color a great deal of the imagined interest in and fitness for a career in the theatre is occasioned by the very rare freak success of a newcomer to the profession such a case is usually accompanied by reams of news stories and in some instances they are stories not really about a newcomer but about a well trained and experienced actor or actress being given a publicity buildup and the newcomer tag is but a useful gimmick unlike many other professions it is very difficult to establish oneself in the theatre there are many heartaches disappointments and frustrations in some cases this has led to mental instability the american negro as a whole has plumbed more levels of society economic religious political etcthan any other comparable group such experiences are of particular value to the negro actor especially in contemporary drama where more restrained portrayals are demanded however as in the classics we have not fared too well such style demands dedicated study and effort far too many members of the profession black and white have aligned themselves with the generally accepted lay opinion that one does not have to study in order to become an actor or actress within the last few years that segment of the profession has dwindled considerably and to the point where we now have a fairly large group of competent young actors and actresses who are ready for almost any assignment if the negro actor aspirant will remember all this and also that his chances of success are further complicated by the fact that he is a negro then i would suggest he secure a copy of the book opportunities in acting by dick moore published by universal publishing and distributing corporation in the vocational guidance manuals series it was written in answer to the many questions asked by those who are seriously considering acting as a career the prospects for the negro actor in search of a career in the theatre are further lessened by the fact that many producers feel the socalled negro show is not a good financial risk as theatrical investments go compared to investments in white shows they seem to forget about many successful negro shows which have been produced for years one could include among them such plays as green pastures shuffle along porgy and bess carmen jones and emperor jones anna lucasta still remains among the alltime record holders for broadway runs of straight plays paul robesons othello holds the alltime record for the broadway run of a shakespearean play even with the bad judgment exercised by some producers in their selection of negro plays it is quite possible that an objective survey would indicate that there is a greater proportion of success among these negro shows based on the total number produced than white shows under similar circumstances the availability of stars also plays a great part in the decision of producers the legitimate stage has not peculiarly enough developed many negro stars not one of the current crop of luminaries was developed by the theatre and yet plays have been shelved for lack of a competent available negro star of sufficient magnitude to head such productions this does not mean that negro actors are not available who could do just as well or possibly better than the desired stars but the precarious economic position of the commercial theatre does not allow for such experimentation in some lay circles the term star has been used rather loosely to the extent it has lost a great deal of its former meaning except to those producers theatrical investors and others who still know and respect the true meaning of the term frequently actors are referred to as having starred in this or that play when in reality the parts played and the billing if any given these actors are not even comparable to feature recognition in the trade the word star is applied to an actor or actress who has reached a stage of artistic development to the extent that they can lend favorable influence to the box office potential once such personalities have attracted a considerable public following they are in the contractual position to demand that their names now synonymous with a well desired trade mark be placed above the title of the play or directly beneath it in very large letters true in many cases this position is not well earned but such rewards are not without consideration for commercial values opportunities for negro actors in the legitimate theatre are so few it is seldom if ever they can grow steadily to the point where they can reach the star category the legitimate theatre has been forced to borrow negro personalities that have been developed in other media many a star has found his original medium more lucrative though and cannot afford the occasional luxury of doing a play or musical top boxoffice attractions such as lena horne and sammy davis are not always available and quite often the roles to be filled are not suited to the particular talents and personalities of this small group since the employment of negro stars usually means the employment of negro supporting players whenever a play is shelved or abandoned it follows that a number of negro actors have been denied a chance to develop towards the star circle this boxoffice draw of such stars as miss horne and mr davis was demonstrated in their last appearances on broadway both appeared in plays that did not receive very favorable critical comment yet miss hornes vehicle jamaica and mr davis mr wonderful had runs of more than a year mr davis latest musical golden boy is still running at this writing and playing to full capacity each week with no end in sight despite not too favorable reviews without a doubt such plays would have closed long since with lesser names this would be true of shows with white stars as well the existence of the star system today is largely due to the desire of the producer to exploit that which he feels creates in the potential theatregoer a desire to fork over the price of admission in this respect he has created what he now terms a frankenstein essentially a stars success is related to the stars ability to attract customers to the boxoffice the figures on the employment of negroes during the past season as compared to previous seasons are somewhat interesting during the above period the total employment of negro actors on and offbroadway dropped considerably from that of the previous season the total number of jobs filled by negro actors reached a new high during the season figures for the last five years are as follows number shows with integrated casts on bdwy offbdwy jobs available on bdwy offbdwy number shows employing negroes on bdwy offbdwy the drop in the total number of jobs available to negro actors during the season as in certain other past periods is mainly due to the number of shows produced with predominantly or allnegro casts for example during the season three shows porgy and bess tambourines to glory sponono accounted for of the total number of employed that year this was all but of the total that same season offbroadway three shows jericho jim crow ballad for bimshire and cabin in the sky accounted for all but of the total employed in that area a total of shows were produced on broadway last season and during the season the most important figures are those under the heading number of shows with integrated casts these figures indicate parts played by negroes that are not designated by the author as socalled negro parts where race is not thematically necessary to the story and not so directed as to imply racial identification it will be noted that these figures have held up pretty well and in fact increased somewhat in addition to the increasing number of negro artists being used in nonracially designated roles another encouraging factor is the number of negro playwrights whose works have been produced in recent years all of them are not necessarily new playwrights but with the possible exception of langston hughes they are new to broadway and offbroadway such writers as james baldwin leroi jones lorraine hansberry deceased louis peterson ann flagg adrienne kennedy errol john ossie davis william hairston loften mitchell alice childress irving burgie abram hill and william branch have been presented to broadway or offbroadway during the past ten or fifteen years the works of of these writers have been produced during the past five years some of these new playwrights might be classified in the angry young man category who sometimes forget that the primary requisite for a good play is its ability to entertain it must first get and hold the attention of the audience if this is not done one might as well be talking to oneself surely there is a place in the theatre for ideas convictions points of view but the craftsmanship and technique of playwriting must be employed to express these ideas and convictions in terms of good theatre for a number of years the negro writer seemed to approach his work out of a peculiar psychological or doctrinal fixation that is his work takes on a conscious or unconscious protest it is very difficult for him to develop or summon forth that degree of confidence selfassurance and inner dignity to approach his work without a certain degree of emotional preoccupation and sometimes that same emotional preoccupation destroys craftsmanship and technique the result is that the literary work suffers dr alain locke wrote in as follows propaganda pronegro and antinegro has scotched the dramatic potentialities of the subject negro drama especially with the few negro playwrights has the propaganda motive worked havoc they have had the dramatic motive deflected at its source race drama has appeared to them a matter of race vindication and pathetically they have pushed forward their moralistic allegories or mellodramatic protests as dramatic correctives and antidotes for race prejudice today however the negro playwright having become aware of his potential strength in the battle for full citizenship has been able to overcome a certain amount of this emotional preoccupation the result is and will be that his work will take on a higher degree of technical perfection and literary value in addition to the established and promising negro playwrights there is further reason for optimism occasioned by some degree of progress in other areas in recent years one or two stage managers have emerged such as charles blackwell formerly of david merrick productions and now working with harry belafonte james wall working in a similar capacity in television irving vincent maxwell glanville currently playing a role in golden boy and one or two others the work of two negro directors was seen on broadway during the past season frank silvera directed amen corner as well as coproduced the play with mrs nat cole and lloyd richards was represented by the musical i had a ball and he will direct another show this season other negro directors who have directed on or offbroadway during the past two seasons are osceola archer edward cambridge and vinette carroll donald mckayle has established himself as one of the top flight choreographers having served as assistant choreographer for west side story red head and more recently as choreographer for golden boy albert popwell directed the dances for the revival of south pacific at the new york city center others of this group are katherine dunham walter nicks talley beatty and alvin ailey in addition to frank silvera and mrs nat cole irving burgie ellis haislip and ossie davis can be added to the list of negro producers this group as well as the negro playwrights can be very instrumental in expanding opportunities for negroes in the american theatre george mcclain has worked in several management capacities and is now assistant manager of the st james theatre he has served as company manager for several large productions on prebroadway tours dick campbell was company manager for the langston hughes show tambourines to glory and for ballad for bimshire he is currently working for crossroads africa the product originated by rev james robinson and after which the peace corps was patterned one of the more successful talent agents is ernestine mcclendon who holds franchises from all of the major performer unions her clients include almost as many white artists as negroes there is a growing use of negro musicians in the pit orchestras of broadway shows and since the desegregation of the new york locals of the stage hands union negro craftsmen are working the broadway theatres perry watkins veteran negro scenic designer has also produced on broadway he is currently working with duke ellington on his new show civil_rights organizations are beginning to realize that the negro creative artist and particularly the playwright and actor exert the greatest influence in the establishment of the negro image conferences are currently being held with the naacp in the hope of establishing an naacp national performing artists advisory committee as a permanent department within the national office with a staff person on both the east and west coasts to pursue on a continuing basis the ultimate objective of complete desegregation of the performing arts the flight from broadway by ossie dav hen i came to harlem in i joined a flourishing comv munity theatre sponsored by dick campbell and muriel rahn the rose mcclendon players where i got my basic training as an actor and as a playwright it is impossible for me to imagine having had any kind of meaningful life in the theatre without this training and i feel this must have been true for most of the student performers whom i met and worked with there the rose mcclendon players was a community theatre in the true sense of the word it cultivated and serviced the harlem community with highgrade theatrical entertainment which gave negroes a chance to see their own lives reflected on stage at least four plays a season to a subscription audience it gave burgeoning negro playwrights a chancewhich they could get nowhere elseto see their plays mounted and performed and it gave negro actors stage managers set designers and assorted technicians a chance to learn and to practice their craftunder the best instruction with the coming of world war ii the rose mcclendon players disbanded but its work was taken up and advanced by the american negro theatre founded by frederick oneal and abram hill ant as it came to be called was even more intensive and extensive in its operations and from its roster has come such theatre people as oneal himself ruby dee sidney poitier harry belafonte hilda simms earle hyman max glanville and a host of others it is difficult to imagine the american theatrical scene as we know it today in the absence of these performers it is equally difficult to imagine they could have made such an impactive contribution had they not had a theatre workshophad they not had antat which to learn and to practice their craft no further argument is neededit seems to meof the indisputable and irreplaceable value both to actors and playwrights etcand to the harlem community itselfof a community theatre but harlem had had no significant community theatre since ant closed up shop in why i think the decisive answer is that broadway discovered ants production of anna lucasta in and gobbled it up that i believe was the beginning of the end for suddenly there was a place downtown on broadway for negro actors the end of a war fought in part against racial intolerance had come and broadway decided to introduce a new concept of the negro to the american public plays like deep are the roots jeb strange fruit on whitman avenue and later native son all followed anna lucasta and most of the functioning cadre of ant joined the march into the theatrical mainstream there was effort from time to time to fall back and regroup to keep the old establishment going out of the blood sweat and tears of those who remained to the end but it was hopeless the suction the sweeping undercurrent flowing towards broadway only a subway ride away was irresistible and a great community theatre so absolutely essential to the spiritual life of the community passed away almost without protest many regretted its passing who felt that a certain tone a certain richness had gone out of the lives of our people and who sought in various ways and at various times to build up another theatre to replace the one that had flown away on the wings of success but the times were against the idea integration the movement of the negro people outward from their ghetto confinement into the mainstream of american life and culture that was the objective too long had we negro actors playwrights directors etc fought to get onto broadway and been by and large denied too long had we been forced to stand on the outside looking in now that the doors were open at lastor so we thoughtwe must make every effort to move through to stop now and devote any of our time and energy to building a theatre in harlem would be to look backwardsin effect to resegregate ourselves after years of struggling to breakdown segregation no one can deny that integration has come to broadway that though much remains to be done the negro is now included meaningfully in most aspects of broadway life certainly he will not find any statutory limits or barriers to his activities the negro is accepted in a way that was unthinkable prior to anna lucasta but accepted into what broadway itself is in a spiral of inflated production costs which makes it more and more difficult for theatre to dare try and make a real contribution to american culture and rising ticket prices that drive more and more people away from its doors every season and while the negro actor playwright director etc can still look to broadway as an arena for the gainful exercise of his talent that arena itself grows smaller and smaller as every year fewer and fewer plays make it to broadway at all and fewer and fewer of that few survive beyond the first week and what of the negro community or in more up to date terms the negro audience can it hope to have its own spiritual and cultural requirements met on broadway as they formerly were met by the rose mcclendon players and the american negro theatre now when the submerged aspirations of the negro are beginning to surface in a more and more disturbing and revolutionary fashion a la watts can broadway as it now liesslowly dying of economic strangulation its voice essentially inaudible on the burning issues of our time vietnam watts poverty crime mississippi etcreally speak to the needs of the negro community or any other community in the thirties broadway was a cockpit where significant ideas were fought and bled over today it is on television that mccarthy and his ism came a cropper or that south vietnam at last manages to engage the attention of the nation it is a motion picture like dr strangelove that brings us face to face with the realities of atom power politics and even more significantly it is to our novelist and writers of essays that we turn now for serious discussions of our social plight what playwright or play is more relevant to the major turbulences of our timesor can command a larger and more attentive audience than james baldwin and his essays leroi jones and his poems or john o killens and his novels tobacco road was about rural poverty among whites it was of another time and quite successful as good theatre and as social comment such a play of our times about urban poverty among negroes and puerto ricans might do equally well on both counts but plays about negroes especially unpleasant plays about negroesie baldwins blues for mr charlie do not make money what producer knowing todays costs of production would want to risk offending his audiences sensibilities at todays ticket prices incidentally mr baldwins amen corner which was not unpleasantin that it did not make the predominantly white broadway audiences feel guilty was not successful true lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun did make money but her sign in sidney brusteiris window did not my own play purlie victorious stayed on broadway seven and a half months and can be counted an artistic success but phil rose our producer ruby and i had to take money out of our pockets to keep it there money we never got back another play offbroadway in which i was associate producer ballad for bimshire an excellent musical also failed what i am trying to say is that while there are no impediments to plays about the truth of negro experience being produced on broadway such productions so far have not succeededhave not been hits in the sense that anna lucasta was the negro community can find its anguish and its joys mirrored faithfully and profitably in books in magazines and in the news on television but on broadwayno dice the great hope that we would be included into the mainstream american theatrethe hope which led us to abandon our own independent community theatre in harlemhas been realized in form but defeated in substance what shall we do we negroes about our needs for living theatre both as performers and as member of the negro community i think we must first realize what is happening to broadway broadway as we know it is changing theatre is becoming decentralized and americans will in the future look less and less to broadway as the endall and beall of drama just as we no longer look to hollywood for what is of real consequence in motion pictures we too must move with the timesand we are community theatres and repertory acting companies are springing up in various places bent more on serving the needs of their own communities than on trying to imitate broadway a tremendous proliferation of nonbroadway oriented theatre groups is taking place all over our country i am myself a member of the founding committee of the american negro theatre inc which aims to secure foundation grants to build a theatre in harlem already kenneth whitlock with his prospect park summer theatre robert hooks and barbara ann teer with their group theatre workshop roger furman and his new heritage theatre and leroi jones and his black arts theatre are beginning the flight from broadwaythe long trip back home surely we shall see a new community theatrenot only in harlem but in all american communitiesnot yet but soon old habits die slowly and broadway was and is still one of the sentimental landmarks in american culture will hate to see it lose face i will hate to see the sceptre pass to other places than new york but broadway grows less and less able to satisfy the cultural needs not only of the nation but even of new york city itself i believe that we being negroes have a special thing to say to ourselves and to the world of our own daily lives which only theatre can express and believe we have a special need to celebrate the rediscovery of our people which only the theatre can fulfill potentially nobody can make more spiritual capital out of the coming decentralization of the theatre than we canand no other groups need it more than we do broadways loss is bound to be harlems gain at least i hope so and i want to be there when it happens in search of the revolutionary theatre by leroi jones revolutionary the atre should force ii change it should be change ah their faces turned into the lights and you work on them black nigger magic and cleanse them at having seen the ugliness and if the beautiful see themselves they will love themselves we are preaching virtue again but by that to mean now what seems the most constructive uses of the world the revolutionary theatre must expose show up the insides of these humans look into black skulls white men will cower before this theatre because it hates them because they have been trained to hate the revolutionary theatre must hate them for hating for presuming with their technology to deny the supremacy of the spirit they will all die because of this the revolutionary theatre must teach them their deaths it must crack their faces open to the mad cries of the poor it must teach anyone names except common sense the revolutionary theatre should flush the fags and murders out of lincolns face it should stagger through our universe correcting insulting preaching spitting craziness but a craziness taught to us in our most rational moments people must be taught to trust true scientists knowers diggers oddballs and that the holiness of life is the constant possibility of widening the consciousness and they must be incited to strike back against any agency that attempts to prevent this widening the revolutionary theatre must accuse and attack anything that can be accused and attacked it must accuse and attack because it is a theatre of victims it looks at the sky with the victims eyes and moves the victims to look at the strength in their minds and their bodies clay in dutchman ray in the toilet walker in the slave are all victims in the western sense they them about silence and the truths could be heroes but the revolu lodged there it must kill any god tionary theatre even if it is wesern must be antiwestern it must show horrible coming attractions of the crumbling of the west even as artaud designed the conquest of mexico so we must design the conquest of white eye and show the missionaries and wiggly liberals dying under blasts of concrete for sound effects wild screams of joy from all the peoples of the world the revolutionary theatre must take dreams and give them a reality it must isolate the ritual and historical cycles of reality but it must be food for all these who need food and daring propaganda for the beauty of the human mind but it is a political theatre a weapon to help in the slaughter of these dimwitted fatbellied white guys who somehow believe that the rest of the world is here for them to slobber on this should be a theatre of world spirit where the spirit can be shown to be the most competent force in the world force spirit feeling the language will be anybodys but tightened by the poets backbone and even the language must show what the facts are in this consciousness epic whats happening we will talk about the world and the preciseness with which we are able to summon the world will be our art art is method and art like any ashtray or senator remains in the world wittgenstein said ethics and aesthetics are one i believe this so the broadway theatre is a theatre of reaction whose ethics like its aesthetics reflects the spir itual values of this unholy society which sends young crackers all over the world blowing off colored peoples heads in some of these flippy southern towns they even shoot up the immigrants favorite son be it michael schwerner or j f kennedy the revolutionary theatre is shaped by the world and moves to reshape the world using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world we are history and desire what we are and what any experience can make us it is a social theatre but all theatre is social theatre but we will change the drawing rooms into places where real things can be said about a real world or into smoky rooms where the destruction of washington can be plotted the revolutionary theatre must function like an incendiary pencil planted in curtis lemays cap so that when the final curtain goes down brains are splattered over the seats and the floor and bleeding nuns must wire soss to belgians with gold teeth our theatre will show victims so that their brothers in the audience will be better able to understand that they are the brothers of victims and that they themselves are victims if they are blood brothers and what we show must cause the blood to rush so that prerevolutionary temperaments will be bathed in this blood and it will cause their deepest souls to move and they find themselves tensed and clenched even ready to die at what the soul has been taught we will scream and cry murder run through the streets in agony if it means some soul will be moved moved to actual life understanding of what the world is and what it ought to be we are preaching virtue and feeling and a natural sense of the self in the world all men live in the world and the world ought to be a place for them to live what is called the imagination from image magi magic magician etc is a practical vector from the soul it stores all data and can be called on to solve all our problems the imagination is the projection of ourselves past our sense of ourselves as things imagination image is all possibility because from the image the initial circumscribed energy and use idea is possible and so begins that images use in the world possibility is what moves us the popular white mans theatre like the popular white mans novel shows tired white lives and the problems of eating white sugar or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing white businessmen of the world do you want to see people really dancing and singing all of you go up in harlem and get yourself killed there will be dancing and singing then for real in the slave walker vessels the black revolutionary wears an armband which is the insignia of the attacking army a big redlipped minstrel grinning like crazy the liberal white mans objection to the theatre of the revolution if he is hip enough will be on aesthetic grounds most white western artists do not need to be political since usually whether they know it or not they are in complete sympathy with the most repressive social forces in the world today there are more junior birdmen fascists running around the west today disguised as artists than there are disguised as fascists but then that word fascist and with it fascism has been made obsolete by the word america and americanism the american artist usually turns out to be just a superbourgeois because finally all he has to show for his sojourn through the world is better taste than the bourgeois many times not even that americans will hate the revolutionary theatre because it will be out to destroy them and whatever they believe is real american cops will try to close the theatres where such nakedness of the human spirit is paraded american producers will say the revolutionary plays are filth usually because they will treat human life as if it was actually happening american directors will say that the white guys in the plays are too abstract and cowardly dont get me wrong i mean aesthetically and they will be right the force we want is of million spooks storming america with furious cries and unstoppable weapons we want actual explosions and actual brutality an epoch is crumbling and we must give it the space and hugeness of its actual demise the revolutionary theatre which is now peopled with victims will soon begin to be peopled with new kinds of heroes not the weak hamlets debating whether or not they are ready to die for whats on their minds but men and women and minds digging out from under a thousand years of high art and weakfaced dalliance we must make an art that will function as to call down the actual wrath of world spirit we are witchdoctors and assassins but we will open a place for the true scientists to expand our consciousness this is a theatre of assault the play that will split the heavens for us will be called the destruction of america the heroes will be crazy horse denmark vesey patrice lumumba but not history not memory not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our despair these will be new men new heroes and their enemies most of you who are reading this on way u by robert burg lmost everyone in the western hemisphere has heard of sir laurence olivier the great english actor who has starred in the theater and on motion picture screens but who pray tell is james earl jones the two namesone so famous the other practically unknown came into juxtiposition last year when life magazine ran a review of an offbroadway production of othello which featured jones in the title role coincidently sir laurence was and at this writing still is playing the same part in a british revival of the ancient play lifes reviewer compared the acting styles of the two men and concluded that jones more than held his own with his completely individual completely absorbing portrayal of the moor of venice in one respect at least sir laurence was laboring under a handicap which several earlier critics had pointed out being white he had to resort to some rather eyestopping and from the critics point of view distracting blackface makeup to more properly assume the role of othello who was a negro jones had no such problemhe is a negro james earl jones is years old is a little on the heavy side although hes tall which compensates for this and has what many theatergoers and reviewers acknowledge to be a most incredibly striking face one that is massive and almost biblical in appearance because of the thick bushy beard that curves around it thick black eyebrows top off this imposing combination of facial features and lend to jones an air of intensity that is just right for the moor of venice he is a bachelor who lives in a messy tworoom flat in new yorks lower east side and his one interest appears to be acting indeed this young man seems to eat sleep and live acting and it is possible just possible that someday his name may be as wellknown as sir laurence olivier at the present however jones is just one of several dozen very talented actors who are littleknown in the new york theater world bobbing about in lowbudget productions and waiting to be noticed by top producers unlike his struggling colleagues though jones is more than satisfied to be where he is at this particular point in time in a profession famous for its stars this is one man who is seriously pursuing his career by acting and studying and who professes that he is totally uninterested in the tinsel glamour that accompanies the hollywood brand of stardom a glance at his theatrical record reveals the deliberateness and purpose that mark his budding career he has had a string of roles which taken together comprise a fine apprenticeship in the theater he has run the gamut from comic roles such as the whimsical cannibal hired to eat the heros motherinlaw in the love nest to more serious portrayals such as the dignified prince of morocco in the merchant of venice and the older brother in the cool world which played briefly on broadway before being made into a film yet despite these and many other parts jones is in no hurry to make a name for himself each week he takes the subway to the actors studio to sit in as an observer on study and criticism sessions and on monday his day off from the theater he is usually in the audience of current plays looking analyzing and even enjoying despite all of this activity and experience this tall handsome actor still must face the obvious question of just how far a serious dedicated negro can go in the american theater below the star level of people like sidney poitier and lena horne and sammy davis jr there are dozens perhaps even a few hundred negroes in show business who exist in a large gray area where nothing ever seems to happen beyond a hardly noticeable role in an occasional play or film is it possible to break out of this area to bigger and better parts jones refuses however to view the theater strictly from the viewpoint of being a negro opportunities for actors in general could be better he saysand means it this is not to say that jones is completely unaware of the color of his skin far from it there are always little incidents that serve to remind him that he is a negro a few years ago for example he was playing the part of the bombadier in the motion picture dr strangelove in the tense climactic scene in which the american plane is rocked by a soviet missile jones was being carefully instructed by the director stanley kubrick kubrick told him to look upward in fright at the moment of the explosion with the camera very low looking up at me jones recalls i thought to myself sonofabitch this guy wants me to roll my eyes if it wasnt kubrick i wouldve said are you trying to get a stepin fetchit effect or something actually i think he almost wanted that effect he wanted simply to suggest it to awaken in the observers mind the particular image of the negro in trouble an even more subtle complication of his being a negro as it relates to the theater is that joness skin is of a medium shade and his nose is slim and conservative in appearance thus when he comes on stage the audiencewhile naturally recognizing him as a negro may find itself more readily able to identify with him than with a darkerskinned actor the writer of a play in which he was understudy to the lead once approached him and told him jimmy i think that if you were out there the audience might identify better with the character the actor in the lead naturally was several shades darker than jones while he may have his sensitivities about being negro there is no question that jones is proud of what he is i dont want to go on stage and eliminate my negritude he says flatly i think theres something so exciting about being what you are whether its being seven feet tall or black or blonde that you shouldnt want to disguise it or pretend it isnt there many white liberals who have applauded the recent trend toward casting negroes in parts that would normally go to white actors or actresses such as ruby dee playing cordelia in king lear will be drawn up short by joness attitude toward this development he does not want to be so integrated into a play as to lose his identity as a negro jones definitely wants parts that are meant to be played by negroes only he has set up an inflexible condition that an audience must recognize him for what he is a black man and then it must accept him this way he is interested in exploring and developing his blackness and in using it unashamedly in the theater ive always wanted to play mephistopholes and emphasize all of his black aspects he says for all of these conditions and demands on an audience jones is resignedat least for the present to the fact that it takes theatergoers a few minutes to get used to him as a negro before it can accept him as a character in the play they never really identify he says but they come much closer to it the deeper into the character i get as an actor i found that people cry watching othello in the moment of his agony and at that moment they necessarily have to forget what he is even bull connor would cry watching othello in spite of himself its that deep psychic defense that people have thats a hard thing to crack it keeps them from accepting negroes in certain capacities to illustrate what he means jones summons up the story of the time he was sitting in a movie theater watching a newsreel about the korean war when a scene flashed on the screen showing american soldiers both white and black in action together a woman sitting nearby jones suddenly jumped up and said in very shocked tones to her companion they dont have negroes in the front lines one need go no further than the television set to see this kind of mentality in action jones believes he points out that tv commercials are a field that is now opening up to negro actorsif they are the right shade theyre trying to do token integration he asserts take a soap commercial lets say its important for the producers to show a negro woman using smiths soapflakes well its almost as important not to have her so specifically negro that anyone couldnt identify with her you recognize the shade and thats the token as a negro in a profession that makes strenuous physical and mental demands on those who pursue it jones has more than once been confronted with the conflict of making a choice of which comes firstcivil_rights or art occasionally he is able to successfully combine one with the other as when he participated in a taped television program about the three civil_rights workers who were murdered in mississippi not long ago it was during this taping that he was confronted with yet another manifestation of the same basic dilemma one of the men in the television studio who had been working with the student nonviolent coordinating committee approached him and tried to talk him into going into the south and working for civil_rights there jones reluctantly turned him down i think if i went down there he says i would have to devote myself to it totally and if i did that i dont think i would take the choice that james foreman or martin_luther_king takes i think i would take the choice of malcolm_x to cope with that situation there is need for that kind of pressure rather than the moral pressure because morality is long gone the more militant black leaders who say that the solution is economics in the north and force in the south are right i mean for now maybe some day morality will be the solution i dont know the curious thing about jones is that even while he is talking about the oppression of negroes in america there is no bitterness in his voice it is as if he were talking about oppressors he has heard about but never met almost in the same breath he will say i dont know what christ was talking about but he was onto something his conviction that malcolm_x had the right approach to the race conflict may even be somewhat explained by his interest in the assassinated black nationalist as a dramatic character id like to perform malcolm_x he says id like to explore with an audience and a director and other actors that phenomenon that was called malcolm_x this last statement isnt surprising when you understand that jones looks on the theater as a pressure chamber where invisible forces froth and boil over indeed it is possible that for him as for other dedicated actors an understanding of life is acquired on the stage in that electric moment when there is that unity of spirit and concentration between actor and audience in that moment when the spark of life leaps from a script jones says that he cannot go onto the stage to pretend to be someone hes not at the same time he may often go before an audience and discover in the character something of himself which until that moment lay below the threshold of his awareness apart from these abstractions of exploration and discovery jones is concerned with the more downtoearth techniques and tools of his profession he is a hard worker for his role in othello he steeped himself in the maze of theories hypothesized by shakespearian scholars to explain the personality of the darkskinned general jones has learned that an actors concentration can be one of his most useful tools gene frankel a new york director and drama teacher taught me that he says concentration on what youre doing on stage on your part is largely responsible for involving your audience you can even be doing bad work but if your concentration is strong enough theyll watch your bad work rather than their dates or the people in the next row i can sense their involvement when my own involvement in the part is strong enough if im too busy watching to see if ive got them i dont get them its like zen its a yoga of acting you do it and then you know it its a matter of total commitment along with these techniques jones has also developed a philosophical attitude toward assessing the value of his own work which other actors might envy there are neither successes nor failures he says i think ive committed myself as best i could to everything ive done if an artist looks at himself objectively he wont see himself in terms of success or failure thats usually for somebody elses judgment joness ambition is to be a great actor that is to be able to play a particular role better than anyone else who had the same kind of talents and skills in an offmoment once jones admitted my life is sort of funny in a way i go around as if the sky could fall in on me at any moment although so far it hasnt lately he hasnt had much chance to check the sky hes too busy making a living in the theater the tattered queens by ruby dee hen about w i first learned the death of dorothy dandridge a tremendous sadness came over me id known her slightly only really over the years our paths had never crossed in workoccasionally socially but i had seen her mostly as an actress and remembered with joy her beautiful performance as carmen in the movie carmen jones i felt i knew her as well as i knew myself what as a young performer she aspired to what she had to settle forthe active search for opportunities the sporadic success the long periods of nothing to look forward to the deliberate pretense of indifference the deep selfdoubt a major role then waiting waiting she was lucky for her career as an actress began with a head start as a singer and between the betweens she could fill club dates how fortunate not to be just an actress i wondered if the tragedy of dorothy was not indeed the tragedy of all negro actresses i worked with an actress once in a huge theatre in the bronx in a playarsenic and old lace i had vaguely known of her what style she had i recall thinking what grace i wondered where she had been trained there was something about her personalitydistinctly royal profoundly human she might have played any role from a queen to a peasant representing any race her name was abbie mitchell she had worked with some of the leading talents of the early s she had been acor country abbie mitchell cicely tyson claimed here but mostly in europe an extraordinary soprano a prima donna i felt fortunate that our lives had touched at the time of our meeting i was quite young and coming along well for a colored girl at the time i believe that often young performers lacking a continuity of experience lacking a knowledge of history of entertainment of the tradition and great contribution that our people have made to the theatre may tend to feel that a whole new world begins with each newcomer not so inspired by abbie mitchell i began to read books about and by negro performers i am deeply grateful to such people as james weldon johnson tom fletcher and edith isaacs for having written on the subject it was through their books that i began to feel a sense of belonging somewhere as an actress as part of a tradition id almost missed knowing abbie mitchell where was her scrapbook where was there a more complete description of her life couldnt my husband ossie davis write her story as a play why didnt talk to her more ask her what it is like to reach the top is there a top for negro actresses why wasnt she as well known and as frequently employed as the leading white performers of the time retired why what would she play next it was some years later by then after talking about her after asking other older performers who came out of retirement about her i finally wrote her asking for an appointment the letter came back unanswered unopened it was marked deceased rose mcclendon and the famous walk down those stairs even ethel barrymore complimented her for it with kindness that comes only from being white regularly employed and nationally recognized who was she had she worked in more than the half a dozen plays id seen referred to where was there a record of her accomplishments i remember tall sensitive edna thomas why dont i see her on television sometimes or broadwayon or off retired now perhaps but because she wants to be it seems that negro actresses enjoyed a fuller creative life in the old community theatre eg the allnegro lafayette players such actresses as edna thomas hilda offley evelyn ellis and laura bowman knew and benefitted from working in stock companies they had a chance to more fully explore the depths of their talent they were not primarily restricted to plays about negroes one may be extremely talented but only constant exposure makes a performer stageworthy and cameraworthy i never heard of a negro starlet with a seven year contract learning the ropes in b movies and studio schools quite a few moderately talented white actresses have blossomed into fame and fortune under such attention what might have happened to dorothy dandridge with a sevenyear contract and the security that goes with it we actresses are so accustomed to the fact that performers such as ethel waters lena horne beah richards pauline myers jane white hilda simms and claudia mcneil have no part in television or work regularly in stock that we stop trying we hear talk of integration and things getting better and indeed there are some marvelous integrated commercials and more negro actors appearing in incidental parts and every now and then racially mixed leads and an occasional allnegro show but these are isolated instances not a trend indicating that things may be somewhat better in an individual sense group participation in the creative life of the country is less than ever we cannot grow in isolation the negro actress is still acting on the fringes not really a part only occasionally let in better off portraying the prostitute the second roles written with not enough imagination and truth we can point to no one of us who has the remotest chance of reaching the prominence of helen hayes ethel barrymore bette davis etc no one with that kind of economic opportunity either we dream we scream we pretend we picket or like some other of our most gifted mildred joan smith muriel smith marion douglaswe quit will the newer names on the horizonlike cicely tyson and diana sands and gloria fosterescape the paucity of opportunity that always seems to follow occasional spurts of comparative good fortune for colored stars when we talk or write about ourselves and our place in american society so much is necessarily a lament but perhaps a look at stark reality may help clarify and make objective our grievances indicate alternatives to despair through some program of action i fully realize the cultural poverty that is abroad in the land leading white actresses are afflicted by some of the same ills that affect the negro actress their lowest level of employment is however often commensurate with our highest there are many more parts written for men than women white and black but my concern here is with the negro actress who faces double discriminationthat of sex and that of race what must we do we negro actresses to be saved we must most certainly make a determined effort to encourage our playwrightsparticularly female to write for all media there is a kind of autocracy about an entertainereach one sort of spinning around in a personal orbit on individual momentum i maintain that we actresses must concern ourselves more with the fate of each other and of the younger actresses coming along by helping to find material and getting it produced by promoting scholarships for intensive training we must also see to it that the new theatres springing up over the country include negro actors as basic and intrinsic parts of their companies indeed the future of the theatre may lie in repertory companies and on the road in the past musicianssingers and instrumentalistsfared better in relation to their art than we have they have been for the most part innovators and pacesetters top money and opportunity however still go to their white imitators innovators in song dance and language theirs is a development springing from the soul roots of our people but that same soul roots truth of the lives of our people has yet to be explored in drama we know best on stage and screen the prostitute the negro maid as a person rather than a stereotype the negro mother the average woman and the middleclass woman have for the most part yet to be dealt with in depth this holds true of the heroines of our history also we must ask our playwrights to do better by us we do have as a people an address to life a cry a joy that is particularly ours that has yet to be fully and unselfconsciously put forward women must become producerspioneering and prospecting among our own for backing i am particularly gratified at the work done in this connection by maria cole and juanita poitier we must see to it that our young people consider the very important backstage and olfcamera roles as technicians more people see films than ever go to the theatre if one of the purposes of art is to effect change we must make every effort to become proficient in every phase of film making working for inclusion in american films at every possible level the reality is that we are but per cent of a population which is geared to segregate and to discriminateimproving i believe but desperately in need of artistic effort to help change the image of the negro and so effect social change more quickly as art not only reflects life but also influences it we must dedicate ourselves to the improvement of life and its truthsabout women about negroes the negro actress cannot afford to be isolated from this effort we must not evade the fact that in todays america most negro stars are at best tattered queens haunted always by an aura of tragedy failure and defeat but we must not be defeated with a sober look at what is happening with us today we must make every effort to make things better for those who will come after us and i would especially encourage those young women of my race most likely to be overlookedthe very black the very africanesque to study and to work i believe they have shied away from theatre because their particular kind of beauty has not only not been encouraged but has been heretofore too often rejected but how else can a people know its own beauty except that those artists most representative of it come forth and tell it the fairskinned those nearer to caucasian in appearance and manners have always fared better in our theatre but are we not basically of african descent in the better times to come there will be equal place on our stage and screens for all shades all types all colors we must see to it that this is so theatre the negro in and out by james baldwin t is a sad fact that i have rarely seen a nej gro actor really well used on the american stage or screen or on television i am not trying to start an artificial controversy when i say this for in fact most american performers seem to find themselves trapped very soon in an iron maiden of mannerisms somehow the achieved record falls below the promise henry fonda for example is one of the most accomplished actors around but i find it very difficult to watch him because most of the roles he plays do not seem to me to be worth doing moreover it would seem to me that his impulse as an actor is very truthful but the roles he plays are not his physical attributes and his quality of painful halting honesty are usually at the mercy of some mediocre playwrights effort to justify the bankruptcy of the american male eg the nebbish with whom he so gallantly struggles in two for the seesaw the point is that one can attend the broadway theatre and most of the offbroadway theatre all season long without ever being moved or terrified or engaged the spectacle on the stage does not attempt to recreate our experiencethus helping us to deal with it the attempt is almost always in the opposite direction to justify our fantasies thus locking us within them now the figure of the negro is at the very heart of the american confusion much of the american confusion if not most of it is a direct result of the american effort to avoid dealing with the negro as a man the theatre cannot fail to reflect this confusion with results which are unhealthy for the white actor and disastrous for the negro the character a white actor is called on to play is usually a wishful fantasy the person not as he is but as he would like to see himself it need scarcely be said therefore that the situations the playwright invents for this person have as their principal intention the support of this fantasy the caine mutiny court martial a majority of one tea and sympathy and tall story are all utterly untruthful plays the entire purpose of the prodigies of engineering skill expanded on them is to make the false seem true and this cannot fail finally to have a terrible effect on the actors art for the depths out of which true inspiration springs are precisely the depths he is forbidden to reach i am convinced that this is one of the reasons for the nerve wracking busyness of our stagekeep moving maybe nobody will notice that nothings happeningand the irritating self indulgent mannerisms of so many of our actors in search of a truth which is not in the script they are reduced to what seem to be psychotherapeutic exercises listening to actors talk about the means they employ to justify this line or that action is enough to break the heart and set the teeth on edge sometimes the actor finds that no amount of skill will justify or cover up the hollowness or falsity of what he is called on to do this is where the director comes in it would seem that much of his skill involves keeping everything moving at such a clip and to have so many things happening at once that the audience will remain in effect safely protected from the play if this is true for the white actor it is unimaginably worse for the negro actor the characters played by white actors however untruthful they may essentially be do dependon the accumulation of small very carefully observed detail thus chester morris playing a thoroughly unreal father in blue denim yet mimics the type so well that it is easy to be misled into believing that you once knew someone like him but the characters played by negro actors do not have even this advantage white people do not know enough about negro life to know which details to look for or how to interpret such details as may have been forced on their attention to take one of the many possible examples the scene in reginald roses black monday in which juano hernandez is beaten to death hernandez plays a janitor in the deep south you will remember who is opposed to integration he does not believeso he informs a marvelously mocking and salty hilda simmsin pushing himself in where he is not wanted he is also telling this to his twelve year old grandson who is beginning somewhat improbably to wonder if he is as good as white people now of course we have all met such janitors and such negroes but their tone is very different and their tone betrays what they really feel however servile they may appear to be there is always a murderous rage or a murderous fear or both not quite sleeping at the very bottom of their hearts and minds the truth is that they do not have any real respect for white people they despise them and they fear them they certainly do not trust them and when such a man confronts his nephew or his grandson no matter what he says there cannot fail to be brought alive in him envy and terror and love and hate he has always hated his condition even though he feared to change it even though he may no longer be able to admit it if the playwright does not know this as on the evidence i gather mr rose did not he cannot draw the character truthfully and the actor who plays him is seriously handicapped this shows very painfully in the scene in which hernandez meets his death his reaction to the effigy of a hanged negro in spite of all mr hernandezs skill is false this is not the first time he has seen such an effigy and if he has been living in that town all his life it is simply not possible for the white people there to surprise himat least they cannot surprise him by being wicked or by being afraid they have always been that and he knows that about them if he knows nothing else any negro facing in such a town three overheated white boys knows what he is in for he can try to outwit flatter cajole them put them at their ease by humiliating himselfthough at this point the spectacle of his humiliation is probably not enough to set them at their ease or if the chips are really at last thank heaven down he can resolve to take one of them with him and even if all the foregoing guesswork is wrong one thing remains indisputable once attacked he would certainly not be trying to get past his attackers in order to go to work not on that morning not in that school not with death staring at him out of the eyes of three young white men all of the training therefore all of the skill which mr hernandez has acquired to say nothing of his talentfor it took a vast amount of talent to bring lucas in intruder in the dust aliveis here not merely wasted which would be bad enough it is subverted sabotaged put at the mercy of a lie for the wellspring on which the actor must draw which is his own sense of life and his own experience is precisely here what mr hernandez cannot use if he had it would have torn the scene to pieces and altered the course of the play for the plays real intention after all is to say something about the integration struggle without saying anything about the root of it if you will examine the play carefully you will find that the only really wicked people in the play are wicked because they are insane they are covered therefore and the crimes of the republic are hidden if we get rid of all these mad people the play seems to be saying well get together and everything will be all right the realities of economics sex politics and history are thus swept under the rug now the negro actor after all is also a person and was not born two seconds before he enters the casting office by the time he gets to that office he has probably been an elevator boy a cab driver a dishwasher a porter a longshoreman his blood is already thick with humiliations and if he has any sense at all he knows how small are his chances of making it in the theatre he does a great deal of acting in the casting office more probably than he will ever be allowed to do onstage and whatever his training he is not there to get a role he really wants to play he is there to get a role which will allow him to be seen it is all too likely that he has seen actors inferior to himself in training and talent rise far above him and now here he is once more facing an essentially ignorant and uncaring white man or woman who may allow him to play a butler or a maid in the show being cast he dissembles his experience in the office and he knows that he will probably be lying about it onstage he also knows why it is because nobody wants to know the story it would upset them to begin analyzing all of his probable reactions would take all of the space of this magazine and then some but resentment is compounded by the fact as a negro actress once observed to me that not only does the white world impose the most intolerable conditions on negro life m they also presume to dictate the mode manner terms and style of one s reaction against these conditions or as a negro playwright tells it explaining how ketti frings came to adapt richard wrights long dream for the stage she was sitting by this swimming pool see and reading this book and she thought this would make a perfectly darling play so she wrote the first few scenes and called out her negro butler chauffeur and maid and read it to them and asked now isnt that the way you poor downtrodden colored people feel about things why yes miss frings they answered and i thought so says the playwrightand so we go on and on and on the point is that the theatre is perishing for the lack of vitality vitality humanly and artistically speaking has only one source and that source is life now the life actually being led on this continent is not the life which we pretend it is white men are not what they take themselves to be and negroes are very differentto say the very leastfrom the popular image of them this image must be cracked not only if we are to achieve a theatre for we do not really have a theatre now only a series of commercial speculations which result in mammoth musicals and daring plays like compulsion and inherit the wind which are about as daring as a spayed tomcatthis image must be cracked if we intend to survive as a nation the negroinamerica is increasingly the central problem in american life and not merely in social terms in personal terms as well i intend from time to time in discussing the theatre to return to this point for think the time has come to begin a bloodless revolution only by a more truthful examination of what is really happening here can we realize the real aims of the theatre which are to instruct through terror and pity and delight and love the only thing we can now do for the tired business man is to scare the living daylights out of him both the albee plays at the york theatrethe death of bessie smith and the american dreamleft me rather waiting for the other shoe to fall both plays seemed to promise more than they delivered but i am not at all certain that i know what it is that they promised this is not by the way meant as a complaint or as a joke i dont mindin the theatre at any ratehaving my cozy expectations swept out from under me and im the type that enjoys being forced to ask myself just what the author had in mind i was hardly ever moved to the heart as we say by either of the albee plays but i was mystified enraged amused and horrified i dont know if you will like them or not but i think you ought to see them to take the plays in the order in which they were presented the death of bessie smith takes place in the deep south much of it in a thoroughly demoralizing hospital there is not a single attractive person in this play unless one excepts the offstage bessie smith and the goodnatured but simpleminded type who takes her on the journey which ends in her death neither bessie nor this man have much to do with the main action of the play there is a question in my mind as to whether they really do much to illuminate it but we will discuss this in a moment in the course of the play bessie smith dies offstage and this is the extent on the surface anyway of herconnection with this drama the plays principal concerni thinkis with the character of a white southern nurse character is perhaps not quite the word i want rarely has less character been presented at greater or more unsympathetic length i hesitate possibly because i am a coward to suppose this creature is intended in any way to represent the fair ladies of the south and yet she is clearly of no interest in herself except clinically and i must add that as i watched her my own memories of southern faces came flooding back bringing with them the nearcertainty that this horror this emptiness might very well be what the southern faceand particularly the faces of the womenhide i imagine that anyone who is old enough will not fail to be reminded of the faces and the personalities of the women who accused the scottsboro boys of rape we first encounter this woman with her fatherand they deserve each otheron the porch of their home she is icily and methodically and not for the first time they certainly have nothing else to talk aboutpuncturing his delusions as to his person his political ambitions and his friendship with the mayor who is a patient in the hospital where she works on the admissions desk the relationship between the father and daughter is absolutely unspeakable as are almost all the other relationships in this play but i was puzzled as to what precisely mr albee wished me to make of it it is a relationship which like the character of the nurse is really of no interest in itself it being doomed by the lack of resources in the people to be static they will have this conversation over and over then they will die or the curtain will fall and what either we or they have learned in the meantime is a question it may be that mr albees intention was to reveal as forcefully as possible the depth of the southern poverty and paranoia and the extent of the sexual ruin but if this is so then i think he has miscalculated i sympathize with him in the dilemma to which his raw material his personages have drawn him i am an american writer too and i know how it sets the teeth on edge to try to create out of people clearly incapable of itincapable of selfexamination of thought or literally of speechdrama that will reveal them but the solution is not to my mind to present these people as they see themselves or as they are we must be enabled to see them as they have been or as they might become otherwise we merely judge them as specimens and feel nothing for them as human beings it has perhaps never been more difficult than it is now to illuminate the person beleagured and bewildered by the irresponsibility and provincialism and worship of mediocrity which he in his innocence mistakes for democracy on the other hand it has possibly never been more important so that i do not object to the deadly hysterical stasis of the nurse but to the fact that mr albee never forces me to identify her inhumanity her poverty her terror with my own for in essence the passionless brimstone exchanges which open the play are the play the tone never changes and we never learn very much more about the nurse or the other people in the play or about the community in which the action takes place there is an arresting sequence between the nurse and a negro orderly but i must confess that the intention here was hopelessly muddled for me by the castingi could not tell at once whether harold scott was playing a white man or a light negro and when it was clear that he was playing a negro i found myself distracted by the question of whether any negro in the deep south would so expose himself to this white witch i did not know what to make of the interne a dull type at best it seemed to me and whatever sympathy i might have been expected to feel for him was demolished by his incomprehensible passion to take the nurse to bed whatever for this leaves i believe only the brief appearance of another wonderfully distracted nurse the offstage bessie and her last paramour and here again either i have totally misunderstood mr albees intention or he has miscalculated i expected at some point in the play some ruthless flash which would illuminate the contrast between the wonderfully reckless life and terrible death of bessie smith and the whited sepulchre in which the nurse is writhing but this does not happen bessie smith bleeds to death the nurse is the only character who knows who she is earlier her father had protested her addiction to nigger musicand the nurse succumbs to hysteria she announces that she too can sing and horribly tries i think i understand mr albees intention here all right but i think it fails of its effect because there is no agony in it people pay for the lives they lead and the crimes they commit and the bloodguiltiness from which they flee whether they know they do or not the effort not to know what one knows is the most corrupting effort one can makewhich the nurse abundantly proves but the anguish which comes when the buried knowledge begins to force itself to the light which must be what is happening to the nurse upon the death of bessie smithhas driven countless thousands to madness or murder or grace but certainly far beyond hysteria the american dream turns out to be the gelded youth so admired here and now it presents a much more bland and amusing surface but can scarcely qualify obviously as a funny play its vision of the antiseptic passivity of american life and the resulting death of the masculine sensibility makes it more closely resemble a nightmare i cannot synopsize this play which offers even less in the way of story and even more in the way of incident than bessie smith it begins at a marvelous clip making its deadly observations with a salty impertinent speed ive got a right to all your money when you die says mommy to daddy because i used to let you lie on top of me and bump your uglies daddy needless to say has long since given that up but it goes flat about halfway and finally surrenders much too quietly i came away with the feeling that it was a far better play than the author realized and that he had given it up much too soon or that both plays were exercises notes for work which mr albee has yet to do i imagine that he will find it necessary to do much more violence to theatrical forms than he has so far done if he is to get his story told it is possible that what i am really complaining about here is a certain coldness intrinsic to albee which will always mar his work but i doubt this for one thing the venom which has gone into the portaits of the nurse in bessie smith and the parents in american dream does not argue too great a detachment but too indignant a distaste and he has a strange way with language a beat which is entirely his which may be controlled by the head but which seems to be dictated from the guts by dennis m blan wo small negro boys stood on the sidewalk as another passed by one said he believes people are prejudiced against him because of his color the other boy asked how can we convince him its not worth the effort the boy replied you just cant teach some people to hate this comic scene was observed by thousands of americans from philadelphia to oakland calif for the first time in the past decade of tense civil_rights conflicts and for that matter at any time in americas history people are invited to laugh withnot atthe trials and tribulations of the negro in the funnies it is a rare occasion indeed nothing has been more sadly neglected in the field of cartoon humor than the negro the door was opened by berkeley california cartoonist morrie turnerthe first negro to be syndicated in the funnies through his integrated comic strip wee pals introduced just one year ago wee pals is now seen by readers of ten major metropolitan newspapers it first appeared in negro digest whose readers also enjoy morries humor in hue his characters all childrenone negro boy wears a confederate capbounce with life and welcome freshness satirizing the foibles of the american negro and the realities of his relationship with the white man the humor of wee pals carries the knockout punch of a prizefighter the philosophical wit of charlie schulzs peanuts and morries own special brand of love and humor he quickly points out that it will not be strictly devoted to negroes but will deal also with the injustices of all minority races as soon as i learn how to draw an indian without using a feather its humor involving integration comments cartoonist dave berger i think its a terrific potential for newspapers says one newspaper editor morrie turners wee pals says what all of us feel but have been afraid to say with humor i dont believe editors are ready to accept this thing turner says perhaps negro humor is not yet ripe for public acceptance as morrie believes but he cannot discount the overwhelming response already by his readers perhaps also morrie says if newspapers were more competitive they would be more willing to give wee pals a chance morries humor charades life with embarrassing and honest realism the youngster who wears the confederate cap was introduced in a sequence carrying a confederate flag in front of two other boys one turns to the other and says obviously american history is not a required subject of the kindergarten class as a cartoonist morrie constantly seeks out his own selfconfidence in each daily strip i die a thousand deaths over each idea as he puts it a selftrained graphic artist morrie toys with each new situation often concerned that it will be understood and liked maybe i worry unnecessarily how others will take it he says many of his faithful fans and close friends often see something else in the scenes and their own interpretation helps them to identify with the characters as wee pals comes to life in americas newspapers they became a living institution for morrie sometimes it seems like they come to life and almost draw the strip for me he explained even though his multiracial cast of children go nameless they are confined to a particular role because of their color or dress in one situation for example a white youngster wearing glasses tells his friend a negro boy here comes a couple of kids ill demonstrate my theory as they approach he slaps a chinese boy in the face a girl standing nearby socks the bespeckled boy in the face in the last panel we see him lying on the ground gamely declaring see its like i told you hate breeds hate the words hate and racism are used cleverly by morrie without bitterness but certainly with a touch of sadness in situations that have heavy moral overtones at morrie turner and his wee pals which he originally wanted to call dinky fellas are fighting their way to the top for a cartoonistany cartoonist success comes hard in the face of stiff competition from those who have made it and those who are flooding the market with an overabundance of new ideas the son of a pullman porter morrie was raised in oakland the neighboring metropolitan city to berkeley where he lives with his wife letha and young son morrie jr in a comfortable home as a young boy drawing came naturally to morrie in grammar school one of his doodles of a football game with all players was framed by the principal and proudly displayed on his office wall because it had so much action in it morrie has been drawing ever since even during world war ii while morrie was serving with the armyair forces th bomber group his cartoons were providing laughter for the soldiers married shortly after the war morrie made a living for awhile as a freelance artist and then went to work as a police clerk in to support his family by he decided it was time to find his own soapbox since leaving the police department he has spent fulltime creating negro humor during these years however morrie has produced more than cartoons for different magazines ranging from true to better homes and gardens the development of wee pals was influenced by comedian dick gregory and charlie schulz whom morrie idolizes as one of the cartoon greats his original allnegro cast was flatly rejected by several major syndicates including united features which handles peanuts whose executives told morrie wee pals would not be a profitable venture nevertheless morrie did not give up his big break finally came a little more than a year ago while the strip was running in a hometown negro newspaper the berkeley post it immediately caught the eye of lew little head of a san francisco syndicate who convinced morrie to integrate the strip in the first week little sold it to the oakland tribune which bills morrie as one of its former carrier boys and other major dailies quickly followed suit including the richmond citizen in tennessee in just the short time that wee pals has been before the public it has found a welcome reception the womens antidefamation league of philadelphia recently honored morrie with its humanitarian award the tribune and the los angeles times which also publishes wee pals have nominated him for the national conference of jews and christians brotherhood award morrie is now producing another integrated army situation strip for the chicago defender called dogbert it carries biting humor and gives morrie a chance to let off steam says morrie candidly where do i go from here problems facing negro actors by woodie king jr he problems of the negro actor are not so much the negro actors problem as they are the white ameriwhen an american negro actor is faced with playing a character he must also confront a trio of problems first should the character be american in its truest sense when american life is most american it is apt to be most theatrical says ralph ellison second should he be negro as negroes really are or negro as we have led whites to believe we are in order to endure and third should the character be american negro the peculiar sensation doubleconsciousnessan american a negro w e b dubois these problems are not easily solved since white america has already told us what the answers are going to be if we intend to act on its stage an old negro actor told me he hated leroi jones two plays the slave and the toilet because they were too filled with protest his student a young beginner agreed with him even to the point of accusing the plays of being vulgar the strange thing was that the beginner had no idea of the kind of plays or the problems the old actor faced during the thirties and forties no idea of the vast history of his craft i will get back to this a little later it was a strange conversation the old actor putting down jones for protest writing and at the same time telling me acting in the thirties had life vitality federal theatre negro macbeth roll sweet chariot run little children and the actors leigh whipper edna thomas son you ought a been there beginners interested beginners view bad road companies inexperienced stock companies and cute community food digesters these prospective actors watch plays and actors that say absolutely nothing the parts the actors play are not worth the time and efforts put into them beginners watch plays that do not attempt to recreate our experiences they watch cute white plays because that is all white america wants a negro actor can sometimes be found in these cute little comedies anniversary waltz come blow your horn enter laughing kiss and tell or something similar his first lines set the negro beginners teeth on edge the embarrassed prospective actor glances about the white theater all the white faces are laughing at the excessive and ridiculous mannerisms the white director has given the negro actor if he makes it the beginner is thinking this must not happen to him he must do exactly as the white actors else the audience will laugh at him simply for being a negro on the stage too but the beginner doesnt know that white people in general dont know enough about negro life to know which details to look for how to absorb the interpretation the negro actor wants to present after reading more plays and how to act books he assumes that he is ready to be henry fonda marlon brando sidney poitier cary grant sir laurence olivier etc he scouts until he finds a white theatre group needing a flat painter carpenter coffee boy etc however before he can get this job he must be able to intellectually discuss sartre albee pinter ionesco beckett brecht and stanislavski he can name a hundred white actors but he cant name five negro actors this is a sad fact recently i talked to a young actress who is paying a great deal of money for acting and singing lessons she had never heard of w c handy or charlie parker and knew absolutely nothing about the history of the negro theatre yet the beginner can tell one everythingafter two months with the white group about the white theatre he will argue about staging a play about what a writer means about the way he would tackle a role if he ever played one finally the little social group will do a little comedy and the negro beginner will be given a cute little buddy part and the white audiences will laugh at him exactly as they had done at the plays he had watched that featured professional negro actors the beginner will eventually learn the truth about all the little social groups he will begin to doubt when white beginners continue to get leading roles no matter how bad they are while he paints sets and occasionally is rewarded with a walkon or a buddy part or perhaps it will be while reading j marriots massive book on the theatre in which the author warns beginners whites against getting with those little groups and working like a nigger forever he learns after about two years of hard labor that sartre and beckett are only talk with these little groups and that they had no intention of using him except as comic relief university theatre the negro actor enrolls believing he will appear in the plays because he will be a student paying tuition to learn all phases of the theatre however he will not be taught all phases of theatre at a university least of all acting again he is left out because the selections are mostly classics or some other form of archaic theatre that was written when the black man did not figure into the scheme of white america and we know that the professors who select the plays are white therefore personal idiosyncrasies enter into the problem and they keep the negro actor from the stage the basic motive is simply resentment towards miscegenation on the american stage in general and the university stage in particular america doesnt want the negro actor to be a man on its stage and since the basic themes of american plays revolve around sex the negro actors situation is tragic the student obtains nothing at all how can he when the actedout play on stage before an audience is the basic dynamics of such a study the true understanding of acting comes when the student is involved in acting and producing before a live audience and the professors destroy this by selecting classics which the negro actor finds difficulty in acting not to mention the difficulty of casting i cant use you in this one mr its a swedish or russian norwegian french etc play the majority of negro actors who seek training in university theatre have traces of the southern dialect if they have not assimilated and the way american education is today one cannot have any traces of the south in speech it is an awful but true fact what then if the student actor is cast because of necessity in three sisters enemy of the people antigone st joan major barbara can he be convincing in such a dated repertory that was written when he did not figure into the scheme of things a drama department must seek truths in theatrical works many professors keep these truths in mind when casting and very often avoid the negro actor the negro actor cannot bring truth as whites see it to the classics however a university willif the national association for the advancement of colored people complainspresent emperor jones or othello and maybe the merchant of venice after consulting the local synagogue but a negro actor cannot look forward to playing a lead character in a university theatre production after graduating he knows nothing about acting before an audience item i compared the average ratio of plays a negro actor appeared in per season to the average number a white actor appeared in per season at wayne state university in detroit also compared the total number of plays of negro graduates against white graduates the ratio was to drama school the only place to obtain acting experience is the drama school the negro actor either goes to a theatre magazine or obtains information from a friend in the theatre both stressing how great the instructor is at teaching mr stanislavskis method the actor finds his past acting experience brushed aside by the teacher he is immediately tossed into a beginners class if he is above average better than every white actor in the class he will work with some name professionals if not he will work with a teacher who has no knowledge at all about the negro and very little about acting the teachers know that established names are impressive to the new actor he will occasionally mention the times he worked with jesse bonstelle petier garrick fiske modjeska brando or beaumont and fletcher not necessarily in this order yet the drama schools with all their faults are the only places where a negro actor can sharpen his craft this of course is because he actually works on a stage with others before a live audience now after a long and arduous journey the young negro aspirant becomes a professional actor some use the achievements of the past to guide their future i said earlier i would get back to this now it is alright to be of the present no one would knock this but when a performer knows absolutely nothing of the history of his profession how can he possibly understand the present the most proficient actors in the businessjames earl jones robert hooks a freeman jr diana sands cliff frazier brock peters ivan dixon abby lincoln gloria foster clarence williams iii roscoe lee browne know the past present and have ideas of some of the future problems they will encounter the photos by carl van vechten and vandamm of the late charles gilpin rose mcclendon canada lee frank wilson jack carter edna thomas abbie mitchell and freda washington are the perfect examples of the glory of the past they were the actors who brought forth to america the famous allnegro productions of macbeth porgy haiti and other exciting plays via the federal theater project it grew out of harlem and it remains to this day an important contribution to the american stage i think it is because those actors had a purpose so many of todays actors lack purpose and direction how can one grasp for something when there is nothing to grasp shout in rage if not really angry and too one cannot communicate and assimilate at the same time item in the midst of the present racial struggle in this country our stage ignores it it treats it as if it doesnt exist negro playwright the negro actors situation can be bettered by joining with negro writers and building an audience within the negro community i think this has been done with great results in detroit at the concepteast theater and in harlem with leroi jones black arts theater both actor and playwright must be willing to experiment with new forms within their respective crafts if this is done the small churches and corner storefronts will be filled with willing ears and it can be done since there is no one to answer to but each other it worked in harlem with the american negro theater they produced phillip yordans anna lucasta with great results it produced worthy plays by negro writers abram hills on strivers row and early plays by young ossie davis and years later mr davis hit broadway with his romping comedy purlie victorious now ossie davis is an experienced writer not one of the typical library writers clifford odets but one who has the background in acting and directing within a negro community and if we do not know yet that a play about negroes must appeal to negroes we should leave the theatre i do not mean they must love or hate it but they must identify with it the playwright must seize new ideas and techniques if the negro actor is to again be of any importance he must disregard the argument he received in collegean argument for a standardization which is paradoxically strangling the actors contribution item the plays of the early abby theatre in dublin were not considered excellent unless they caused a riot the theatre as it is today without controversy and excitement save leroi jones is dead theatre it is a place to go and digest dinner the negro playwright should write about what he understands all around him he can see what happens when white writers pen negro struggle situations they all fail due to a lack of understanding the subject as a negro playwright tells it explaining to james baldwin how ketti fring came to adapt richard wrights long dream she was sitting by this swimming pool dig and reading this book and she thought this would make a perfectly darling play so she wrote the first few scenes and called out her butler chauffeur and maid and read the first few scenes to them and asked now isnt this the way you poor downtrodden colored people feel about things why yes miss fring they answered after considering which is better keeping miss fring happy or disliking the play italics mine and i thought so says the playwright and on we go and on and on all the critics felt approximately the same about it after it opened on broadway here in part is one example from john chapman i did depart after the first act of this one and reported to my newspaper that this act of the long dream was shoddy and lasciviousa degradation of my seat companion and of several admirable negro actors it seemed impossible that this play could have been adapted by the lady who did such a beautiful job of adapting thomas wolfes look homeward angel of course the better things about the play were omitted by mr chapman the brilliant direction by lloyd richards and the two excellent performances by a freeman and lawrence winters the same thing happened when baldwin wrote blues for mr charlie all his white characters were badly drawn and many thought this would have been impossible for baldwin to do since it is he who stresses always that negroes know more about whites than whites know of themselves negroes have been taking care of their children and kitchens for over years i also think that more negro novelists should write for the theatre if the long dream the cool world mandingo etc then it should be john o killens ronald fair william melvin kelley chester himes or some negro writer doing the adapting and even though baldwin failed with his white characters his negro characters were so real and vivid that one is held spellbound by them let me say this in conclusion if the negro actor can impose his own values upon the american stage namely his past present and possible future he can join with white america in controlling it theatre of reality by ed bullins the contemporary american theater many times the black playwright finds himself in opposition to the black actor principally when the actor manifests attitudes and behavior that the writer is engaged in altering there are considerations that a novelist does not concern himself with but that a playwright is compelled to if the playwright is realistic and sincere about having his work produced the essential and most arbitrary element is humans the producer the director the actors the hypothetical audience and sadly the critic a generality that can be made is that the producer of stageplays is concerned with making money in america there are the becks of the living theater in new york which the police shut down they are currently touring in europe because america resisted their dedication to pure and noncommercial theater the becks believe that producing plays which advance or keep vital dramatic art is a duty they are so antitraditional as to have staged ezra pounds adaptation of classic japanese noh theatre and in contemporary spirit presenting kenneth browns the brig a dramatic experience which resists labeling not being quite a play nor an antiplay the becks present production frankenstein which opened in europe is experimental which stretches understatement to its limits but it may be the boldest attempt at staging antonin artauds ideas for a theater of cruelty to date the becks living theater is as diverse as art and there are too few young dynamic people today like peter rachtman of the west coast rachtman is one of the group that brought leroi jones powerful dutchman and the toilet to los angeles and san francisco and though profitoriented rachtman is not discouraged from staging productions of quality though they be against the status quo and not meek and quite white american if they are good box office this is only to say that quality sells as does trash ideally lowkeyed quality plays can be produced successfully as can more sensational ones in good or poor taste and this also implies that plays by or about negroes have to be neither sensational controversial nor banal cinema has broken this ground with films such as lilies of the field and nothing but a man but whatever the play it should be honest if honesty is controversial then that is the truth of drama so it is for the black playwright to do the best he can at his job of writing and presenting his vision and not become prematurely emasculated by the prospect of not being produced only because of his race and the themes which come naturally from his cultural experience a black playwright must find his producer as one of any color must and as the black novelist has to seek out a publisher though the playwright may discover he has special handicaps in getting produced for one unlike the widening shelves of negro novels there have been only a small number of successfully produced negro plays that is plays by negroes concerning negro characterization and created for the general audience not that special almost exclusively white audience which patronizes negro drama for obscure exotic reasons there is hardly any precedent of success by which the negro playwright can win his producer and the producer being commonly white has the colorbarrier as an intensifier of his suspicions that he is gambling on something into which he has minute insight he worries that he can sell black novelty and innovation to a newly created audience if there were any major black producers this factor might be reduced but the situation appears to remain as it has been the most relevant item in the playwrightproducer relationship is cost it may cost a producer times more than a publisher to back black talent and businessmens ledgers are especially sensitive to two stains red and black ink if there is a common prayer universally murmured by playwrights one of its petitions is that their work get adequate direction adequate direction is usually more than the compulsiondriven play wright believes probable and he feels inspired direction is entirely within the dimensions of miracle when the playwright laments his past productions the director is likely to be given a large share of the abuse and the remainder goes to the aggregate components of the disaster of course some playwrights can capably direct their own works but this is rare different aesthetic physics are at work in writing a play and manipulating the many elements that go into a staged play and the writer is ordinarily too close to his baby to have the scope and objectivity needed to raise the work from the page and from within his imagination so that it may be communicated completely to the audience happily for the novelist he is the lord of the small universe he creates and his fictional souls shuffle along in time to his whims and no others the negro playwright has a special problem in finding better than average direction outside of the new york theater area there is an absence of capable black directors and within new york the same statement possibly holds true why would a negro playwright prefer a negro director it could be assumed by the writer that a director with like cultural experiences could better interpret the nuances and shading of meanings in the work identifying somewhat with the characters situations and with the theme if the reverse is true if the playwright prefers any excellent direction to that of the average then it is a problem that belongs to every playwright to have his work interpreted skillfully and when the playwright understands that the best direction is beyond the simple limits of interpretation then the directors art and understanding of theater techniques can begin working much to the benefit of the total production the total production stands very nearly upon the performances of the actors even shakespeare has taken many a pratfall behind the ineptness of actors for the playwright of color finding qualified negro actors for his cast is difficult though there are numerous available bodies ready to stand before the lights and expose their teeth and overblown egos of all his problems the negro playwrights greatest is the young trained actor and actress of his same race not the lack of trained people this training does not necessarily qualify these actors for many roles the black playwright has in mind if a negro playwright is to write effectively and honestly he must draw upon his experience all negroes do not come from the ghetto naturally but if the situations the playwright creates upon stage have characters he knows to have basis in truth ordinarily these are black characters it is very difficult for many negro actors and actresses to identify with negro characters from the masses though they do well representing extremely middle class negroes the same may hold true for young white actors at auditions the black playwright might observe a black actress mouthing her lines like a white telephone operator or bouncing through a scene set in the black ghetto of south philadelphia as if she were doris day aping the american version of the blueeyed girl next door some male negro actors appear horrified when asked to speak like sonny liston and seem offended and say that they can not talk that way and will not even say those words they mince out the exits leaving behind remarks like i thought an actor was needed sadly the black playwright did not have it in him that day to create the modern american othello or cleopatra he merely wrote from what he knew so his contemporary play was left in need of just black actors ones who were not afraid to act as black human beings a playwrights major problem as opposed to a novelists is that each of his characters must be what he is they all must stand tall this must be brought out by the convincing performances of the actors to be what the character is then the actor must portray the character in an honest and natural manner but today it would not seem unlikely that a director would come before a negro actor newly graduated from an american school of acting and spend hours with him saying now remember in this part you are a negro you are black and the pity is that the actor would really have to sweat to get into his role he would have to work diligently convincing himself that he was indeed negro often a characterization falls the actor the director or the playwright fails collapsing the structure of the plays reality about their ears a novelist has more range to ramble in than his characters believability or their situations he can even chat philosophize and wisecrack with his readers characters in drama are resented by the audience for their not sticking to the point maintaining the honesty of their motivations with the negro playwright it is the negro actor who dramatizes the vital characters and the actor must breath the truth of his own conviction in that character for his portrayal to be perfect but not all the blame rests with the black actor or his schooling there are interracial and a few entirely negro theater groups training black actors to do little other than the greek classics shakespeare chekhov and shaw casting negroes indiscriminately in every conceivable role a sort of white characterization done in authentic black face true the experience for the actor is invaluable and should be a part of his training but a hidden evil exists in the continuation or the strict adherence to this brand of liberality it is a selfdefeating device for the actor the black actor is unintentionally made to say in essence that he can act too he a black man can do the classic repertoire of the continent as can a white actor that he can act and not only be stereotyped in butler roles set in the ante bellum south well it should be known that he can act especially by the actor one of his number has won an oscar and others appear on nationwide tv though it is questionable whether these are any criteria of adequate professional standards incidentally these black actors play negroes not creon following the above type of reasoning is tantamount to the black authors wasting years telling his waiting readers that he can write that he is concerned with the art of writing and nothing else but getting almost no writing completed and in print aside from his infrequent artistic manifestos sent out to indicate that he is still breathing the fight by the black actor to prove that he can act is as much over as the black writers fight to prove that he can write and both should get to work at their crafts and be aware that aristotle and his aesthetic dogmas are not of this time and never had been meant for the black artist anyway there are new roles new themes and new definitions being created and explored now and the black actor and writer should become aware in approaching one of the artistic black theater groups the negro playwrights scripts may be taken and returned shortly and the playwright told that his work is too experimental or obscene if it uses too much of the negro idiom of the ghetto the groups premise might be that when negroes of flesh and blood are depicted on the stage that this is verging upon revolution and is too drastic it is far beyond the groups range of belief and comprehension they can not become familiar with a real negro on the stage or the playwright may be told that they do not bother with original scripts that they do the classics or the work of proven negro writers like langston hughes that is the negro writers who have made it somewhat with the white press and then are considered minor celebrities by the black bourgeoisie then the artsy craftsy colored folk accept them as their own when asked why they do not produce young black playwrights the answer almost invariably is there are none are there of course there are none to their knowledge because of their refusal to look for or acknowledge any until the white critics deem it correct for them to with this situation existing entering little theater for the black playwright is more than likely not an asset to his career but a handicap for he will seldom find other than the conventional timid and intellectually lazy and backward bourgeois black masquerading as an artist the theater of reality should be mentioned now when speaking of the audience and the critic the revolutionary nature of this theater is not of style and technique but of theme and character any theatrical style or method can be used separately or in combinations to reach the truth of the play in this manner the play could begin naturalistically with a character in a realistic setting and progress through expressionism surrealism absurdity and back to realism dramatizing the journey of the character through his own pysche to reach his loss of innocence selfawareness or illumination to reach what individually is called reality the method is not the goal in this theater the result must elicit the single response of yes so it is not a call for a return to realism or naturalism that this theater calls for it is the exposure of illusion through exploding myths and lies that are disguised as reality and truths these myths and especially those concerning the black man clutter the heart of his existence his humanity nor is this theater a plea for his humanity time will not be wasted in silly issues this theater is not exclusively about negroes nor for negroes its trend should only go counter to that force in western society which dehumanizes enslaves and defeats man at his best whether this force originates in mans institutions or his bewildered psyche that has built a defense and powerstructure that can not be much longer contained this theater in this century may be viewed as against society the american society in particular by white critics it will undoubtedly be misnomered protest literature and yes it will certainly expose some of the wrongs of the society for this theater is against the hypocritical cant and morality of this sick society and demonstrates how sick the society is by exposing her sores her warped humans if this is social realism or protest then let it speak reality for all people not only a temporarily deprived selfish middleclass today the bulk of the theater going audience is white one problem for the negro playwright is that part of the audience will resist the reality of his characters they will refuse to identify with black characters in any way even the middleclass negro members of the audience will fight the characters if they come from the submerged elements of the culture the characters of the new reality will be fought whether they are upon a stage or found in a book and most of the inaccurate criticism of negro works have had this kind of bias at its roots the white critic is deceived by himself and his colleagues and the university departments of literature always years behind perpetuate and sustain these myths one great boring myth is that black writers are collectively engaged in writing protest literature and can or will do little else these same people should get hip to chester himes a talent of major proportions who has been around before a lot of them this lie of protest has circulated so widely and convincingly that it has damaged most contemporary negro writers as passed over earlier it may have destroyed the most talented black writer of today but perhaps the times will rescue him for his art and it is hokum lately two of the most authentic works of black protest literature have been the book black like me and the documentary play in white america and both have been authored by white men but small knowledged english professors across the country if they mention it at all without having seen the production or having read the script are branding leroi jones play the toilet a protest play when it is simply a love story done in a melodramatic naturalistic vein the writer can not worry about the audience he knows there is a small hardcore audience for him and they will discover one another and luckily the audience will grow to universal proportions and the writer knows that there is only one critic himself all that a reviewer or a critic can do positively for a writer is to get him more audience appeal or get him more readers if the critic fails to achieve this then the writer should dismiss him the black writer knows that the critics are white and they are most certain not to understand his work or get its finer points especially when the writer is not slanting his work to a middleclass white audience and he is setting his own limitations and not relying upon the critics judgments honesty is what the writer should be after the theater of reality is an attempt to return to mans honesty to himself to his fellows and in his vision it is indeed a theater of metaphysical yearnings the playwright does this job by uncovering the reality of his art his humanity his existence as an intelligent and moral entity in the universe and makes the entire universe an audience of this transformation of the psyche and spirit this new revolution is of the mind and spirit and the revolution seems to have begun and if it has there are many facets to it there are the doers there are the theorists and there are the chroniclers and story tellers each is working from within a framework of reality which can always be expanded illuminated and hopefully passed on festival time in iluhur the festival t is a grandiose idea andas such ideas are likely to be characterized by a certain dreaminess but that is not necessarily a fault without great dreams many little miracles would not be possible the chief dreamer is leopold sedar senghor the poetpresident of senegal like most serious african leaders president senghor is concerned with africas achievement of genuine power and consequence in the world and he feels that the edifice of african power and consequence must be built on a base of cultural security the historical significance of the first world festival of negro arts flows from two facts president senghor told the senegalese people the first is that the festival will be held in dakar in senegal in other words in africa the birthplace of the negro peopleof homo sapiens himself even where it will mean something more than a return to original sources it will be a case of man sinking his roots into mother earth the second fact is that the stage of defending negritude has passed and that the festival will serve rather to illustrate it and as an illustration and no longer a theoretical exposition it will constitute a definite action a positive contribution to the construction of a civilization based on universal values in a word we will have ceased once and for all to be cultural consumers and will at long last ourselves become cultural producers such then is the significance of this event which will mark the advent of a new era for us the era of cultural independence i say independence and not autarchyfar from it because the works to be assembled and displayed here will almost invariably have been enriched by foreign contributions and it is well that this should be so since the problem for negritude in this twentieth century of ours is to participate in the convergence of all mankindnot exactly in this atomic century by contributing new techniques but by contributing a new style a soul the same which quickened the pulse of homo sapiens when the sun of reason rose above the horizon it is the language of poetry the actual planning of the first world festival of negro arts was entrusted to a local committee at dakar and to the governments of the dozens of countries in africa and the americas which indicated interest in participating in the festival the festivals aims were generally outlined as follows to permit negro artists throughout the world to return periodically to the sources of their art to make known the contributions of negritude a negros pride in his race and a recognition of the innessbrown of new york city john a davis president of the american society of african culture is the committees vice president marian anderson is vicechairman of the committees board of directors and mrs lyndon b johnson wife of the president of the united states is honorary negros unique creative ability based on his african heritage to make it possible for negro artists to meet and demonstrate their talents to members of the international art world to advance international and interracial understanding the american committee for the festival is headed by mrs virginia chairman of the committee in many ways the american participants in the festival will strikingly illustrate the concept of negritude the african

city dakar is a city of some people a portcity on the atlantic which also is an important terminal for flights between europe and south america it is an old colonial center but it is a very new cityit is in fact two cities the principal city is a glittering aggregation of modern government buildings apartments and villas with broad boulevards and cozy parks the other city is a conglomeration of shackssome of them all but incredible and pungent market places and medinas straight out of the ancient past the main city is frenchflavored and mostly frenchoccupied there are some europeans in dakaror there were that many until the recent decision from paris cutting back on military outposts in senegal and other african countries closely associated with the french government the europeans reside in most of the beautiful villas and plush apartment buildings on the plateau the cosmopolitan heart of the city but not because there is racial segregation there emphatically is not only a few africans can afford to live in such luxury also the better shops along the avenues william ponty and maginot and bordering independence square are owned by the french and those not owned by the french are in the hands of lebanese and greek traders the other city is predominantly african its borders are not geographical for africans live throughout the city even on the plateau the french colonialists being less racist than the british did not disdain the africans in whose midst they found themselves and so they built their villas next door to the african huts the african city is principally distinguished by the style and quality of its housing the better of these old residences are low rambling structures walledin from the street and set around a courtyard the worst of them are wood and cardboard leantos but there are the medinas the native quarters which stretch for miles depressingly toward the developing suburbs but all in the african city is not depressingfar from it some of the new housing developments beyond the medinas are handsomer than any similar residences negroes occupy in america they were designed for middleincome people and there are individual villas replete with gardens and garages as well as blocks of apartments there also are shopping centers usually with new movie theatres with one key exceptionthe ministry of financethe government of senegal is in the hands of africans and it is africans one sees relaxing against the burgundy upholstery of the huge citroen limousines the cadillacs of france gliding through the streets but africans are all but absent in significant industry and business in the sprawling markets the african stalls are the poorest and least attractive and africans are present in the offices of the utilities and the professional services primarily as clerks there are more than hotels in dakar a few of them ngor croix du sud very good a few of them fair vichy hotel de la paix atlantic plateau but most of them quite small and ordinary there are many restaurants some of them excellent and nearly all of them french the exceptions are the vietnamese and lebanese restaurants there are no africanowned restaurants in dakar that americans would want to patronize one of the liveliest nightclubs is africanownedthe nianey it is located on la corniche the seaside drive and it is as wellappointed as any of the others discotheques are popular and there are several to choose from the music is as familiar in dakar as it is in atlanta and the dancing is not very different there are several sidewalk cafes a large number of movie theatres super markets and shops selling everything from mink coats to razor blades some of the most interesting shops for being exotic are owned by the lebanese and greeks and they feature items of clothing and utility which appeal to the religious faith of the african populace that faith is islamic an estimated per cent of the senegalese are moslems the great mosque is a structure of imposing stature and considerable beauty there are several dozen lesser mosques scattered throughout the city and an astonishingly elegant mosque at touba some kilometers from dakar the people the dominant raceor tribe in dakar as in all senegal is wolof other races are peul serere tukulor diola and malinke the wolofs are prominent in government education and in the arts the senegalese have been in the vanguard for generations for they were favored by the french administrators during colonialism as teachers and subofficials throughout the vast french west african empire the large number of french people in dakar is a consequence of the citys choice as governmental industrial and educational center during colonialism thousands of frenchmen pulled up roots in france and settled in dakar and many of those still living there were born there they no longer control the actual machinery of government but the industry remains solidly in their hands and while an increasing number of africans are assuming key jobs in education top posts in the university and the secondary schools are held by frenchmen and other europeans the president of the rapidly growing university of dakar is french for example next to the french the major merchants in dakar are the lebanese and greeks they are traders by tradition and whole blocks in the center of the city are lined with their shops one little different from the other all selling the brilliant cloth and arab robes so popular with the africans the near easterners like the french have little to do with the actual business of running the government a colorful minority in dakar are the moors the angular handsome nomads from mauritania who reap considerable wealth through the establishment of small stores in the african areas there are few moorish women among them apparently the moors come down on foot from mauritania in teams of three or four spend a period of three or four months minding the stores which remain open virtually around the clock then return to their families while others take over the commercial chores they live very simply spending money only on food their simple blueandwhite or blackandwhite robes and on sandals they socialize with none of the other groups another minority in dakar are the portuguese an artificial race of portuguese and african ancestry they hold themselves somewhat aloof from the ordinary africans and yet they lack the status of the educated africans they are clerks barbers and minor functionaries festival facilities at the cost of some the government renovated and enlarged yoff airport perhaps the busiest air terminal south of the sahara a new classiclined museum was especially built to house the countrys impressive collection of african art and artifacts the collection of art and sculpture which has been assembled from all over the world for the festival also will be exhibited there the daniel sorano theatre one of the most modern and most comfortable theatres in the world was built for the festival most of the performances will be presented there before a select audience the theatre seats only amity stadium which will accommodate some persons also was built for the festival all performances held at the daniel sorano theatre also will be held in the stadium so that the general public can attend another minority in dakar are the portuguese an artificial race of portuguese and african ancestry they hold themselves somewhat aloof from the ordinary africans and yet they lack the status of the educated africans they are clerks barbers and minor functionaries goree island one of the historic sites of africa will be the scene of a nightly sound and light spectacle during the festival the island served as a staging area for many of the hundreds of thousands of africans who were sent into bondage during slavery it also was inhabited by the dutch english and french during different eras and served as a fort for france during the two world wars on one end of the island the elaborate underground tunnels and fortifications reminiscent of the maginot line remain pretty much as they were originally the united states gift to the senegalese government for the festival is a handsome motor launch which will transport visitors from the dakar docks out to goree island the trip takes about minutes festival footnotes while christians represent only about six per cent of the dakarois population there are several remarkably handsome catholic churches in the citv and the cathedral of dakar which occupies a site at the very center of the plateau section is an impressive edifice some of the choral music performances will be presented at the cathedral the brilliant costumes of the african womenlavenders and crimsons and chartreuses are favoriteswill startle many american negroes but the sight should prove once and for always that bright colors definitely do compliment dark skins black american women traditionally have shied away from brilliant colors for much the same reason that many negroes refuse to eat watermelon but the sarilike costumes in senegal might begin to change all that the artisan village a little compound where ceramists goldsmiths and silversmiths weavers and sculptors work display and sell their products has been upgraded and modernized for the festival visitors will find unfortunately that prices also have been upgraded and modernized the best buys here probably will be gold and silver jewelry as other items may be bought more reasonably by haggling with peddlers along avenue william ponty or on the streets of the city haggling over price incidentally is a tradition in africa the buyer who pays the first price asked by the seller will be taken africans expect to argue and bargain and they are skillful at it however for the american unaccustomed to such practices the danger is that inflated prices will be paid for items the sight of men walking along the streets holding hands might startle some americans but it shouldnt it means only that they are moslems and friends and not as the late richard wright naively assumedthat they are sexual or homosexual partners there are some lepers in senegal and some of them will appear as beggars on the streets of dakar visitors to the festival must expect to be regularly accosted by beggars as well as by platoons of peddlers many handicapped africans are trained to beg for a living and the practice is encouraged by the concept of charity in the islamic faith only those with very strong stomachs and insatiable curiosity are advised to brave the bowels of the great central market but for those the experience will be worth it it is fascinating for example to watch the women hack and approtion the huge fish sold in the markets lower depths the french in dakar will be hostile at worst and will feign monumental indifference at best they should be ignored however festival visitors should insist on courtesy and service as they certainly will be paying for it a dollar is worth francs frenchafrican community francs not the kind from france on the books but the local bank exchange is about francs for a dollar travelers check and for a dollar bill that does not include the one per cent charge for making the exchange all visitors to the festival should have visas preferably obtained before entering the country however president senghor has given assurances that visas will be available at the dakar airport for those arriving without them there is a charge visitors also should have roundtrip or intransit tickets indicating that they will travel on from senegal after the festival apart from taking the usual smallpox and yellow fever and cholera and typhus shots visitors to senegal should take along dependable antimalaria pills taxis are plentiful in dakar and they have meters visitors should not pay more than is indicated on the meterexcept late at night when the meter tab is doubled as a sort of service tax tipping in senegal is not done according to americanor even europeancustom a five per cent tip is considered adequate there are several excellent beaches at dakarat the hotel ngor below the coastal drive near the residence of the american ambassador mercer cook sr and below the park along boulevard roosevelt there also is an excellent beach at goree island restaurants are located nearby and save a round for jamie brown by anita r cornwell e stood in front of the bara tall thin forlorn figure in soiled khakisfingering the c hange jn his pockets he was new in town having just hopped off an interstate tractor trailer some thirty minutes ago and he knew he should be looking for some place to sleep but the one dollar and fortyseven cents clutched in his bony hand did not provide the needed encouragement a brisk september breeze swept down the avenue banging against his hunched shoulders and he looked around wondering if hed ever see a friendly face again then from inside the bar he heard the jukebox hammering out a down home blues which set the wheels of memory spinning in his aching head he jerked his hands from his pockets and slowly pushed through the battered door the music was still loud and going good as he slid onto a corner stool and plunked his quarter down so thered be no question concerning his ability to pay he ordered a glass of beer then pulled out a crumpled pack of stale cigarettes the record ended and soon he was aware of one man pulling away from the small group at the other end of the bar and apparently headed in his direction the stranger gingerly holding a bottle of beer in one hand and a long thin cigar in the other wore a wide brim beige felt hat which set firmly on his head as though welded there and a yellow silk tee shirt which stretched endlessly across his bulky chest and disappeared down into black gabardine slacks tightly gathered at waist and ankles his tan narrowtoed shoes made quick tapping sounds on the hard barroom floor and any moment jamie fully expected the fellow to stick the cigar between his teeth yank the hat from his head and break into the old soft shoe routine as he neared jamies stool his leathery face broke in a gaptoothed grin and jamie not quite knowing what else to do lifted his glass and drained it surprisingly enough jamie brown jr the perennial country boy and harry lem yonkers onetime country boy now turned city slicker hit it off rather well i was born in south carolina lem told jamie after they had moved over to a booth but once i lit outta them woods i never looked back he gave a significant pause then you from down that way too i bet jamie nodded he was born in georgia in the midst of the depression but hed been travelling since he was old enough to hop a moving freight i been in charlotte a while he said carefully lem was silent as he lit a fresh stogie then taking a long pull from his beer he ran one finger across the small neat mustache which hugged his lip like a pencil mark the law after you jamie shook his head woman trouble he said grudgingly then began fishing around for another cigarette lem grinned i guess you busted he said finally jamie nodded his brooding eyes staring at his beer glass he hadnt allowed himself to wonder why lem was being so friendly so if it was a little game in the back room he was after he could move on now however lem only leaned back against the booth his odd catlike eyes examining the ceiling while his mind seemed busy with some far off activity i got a room up on the avenue he began slowly and if you aint quite prepared to put up at the bellevue maybe youd like to try your luck there till you git straightened out jamies stomach muscles tightened if there was one thing he was sick of it was sharing other peoples rooms in charlotte when he wasnt with his girl he had his cousins two small but overactive boys in the bed next to his and back home hed slept on a pallet under the kitchen table even now he could feel that hard floor trembling as an outraged march wind tore at the corners of that crumbling shack he looked over at lem almost ready to refuse the offer but the agile lem jumped ahead of him of course he began amiably if you have other plans now dont let me interfere and jamie of course had no plans there were dreams but nothing that included an immediate roof over his head so finally he accepted lems invitation and decided to worry about motives later lems room up around nd street was fairly comfortable and surprisingly clean the bed looked terribly tempting to jamie who had been sleeping on everything but a bed for the past several weeks lem explained that the landlady took care of everything just leave your clothes in the bathroom he said to the boneweary jamie miss mamiell tend to em late next morning while jamie dressed in his freshly laundered clothing lem slumped down into the lone comfortable chair propped his narrowtoed shoes up on the outdated coffee table and began sounding jamie out whereupon jamie promptly announced his intentions of finding gainful employment lem nearly swallowed his stogie man you crazy or something that eight to five crap is for squares you one of th little people and black to boot you aint ever gonna git nowhere nohow so you may as well live while you standing still in your own little rut turning his back on lem jamie grunted his hands deep in his pockets his eyes raking the avenue his mind a thousand miles away on caro the girl who had twotimed him in charlotte finally he looked back at lem who was still on the same old tune the way i figure it lem was saying rather smugly a mans gotta use his head to git along in this old world now me i can git a little lucky at times so i get picked up now and then so what he demanded waving a languid hand there aint hardly any more bugs in the cooler than here and i dont hafta worry bout the rent or the women hounding my door his eye caught jamies man them broads can be a pain cant they they give you a quarter and think they own you one of them big loud ones got her wine head tore up one night and come barging in here like hurricane hattie and liken to kilt a little chick id just met at the timbers he sighed heavily remembering the atrocious incident and i guess you know what miss mamie said after that no more entertaining in the room meaning no more broads naturally a faint smile crossed jamies lips as he pictured the fat broad giving lems chick hell now he knew why lem didnt mind him staying here but he wanted no part of lems copdodging schemes so early next morning armed with several want ads from the sunday paper which hed found stuffed under the bath tub he made his way downtown and many hours later a rejoicing jamie had a job as an elevator operator he could hardly wait to see lems face when he told him the news man youre kidding lem said quickly and jamie mistaking lems reaction for disbelief over his great good fortune went on to relate even the minute details which led to his find when jamie finished lem held his head in mock despair and here i spend half the day lining up something good for you he groaned man the setup is waiting an open book you can make more in one day with that territory ikes got for you than youd make in a whole year hiking some elevator up and down jamie clammed up his wounded sheep dogs eyes avoided lem who immediately realized his approach had lacked finesse tell you what he said springing up out of the chair and giving jamie a smile which displayed his gap and most of his gold fillings ill get ike to hold the book whilst you think about it he sighed his eyes rolling up to the ceiling its sure a sweet setup though i would take it myself but them bluecoated bastards are on my tail right now i cant even look crosseyed less they right there smelling around and you cant pay off nobody hardly any more he lamented turning to stare out at his beloved avenue jamie shrugged but did not vocally reject the proposal if lem wanted to believe he was stupid enough to get mixed up with the numbers racket he would go right along letting him think it but he was ready to settle down and he knew if he had a steady job and kept his eyes open sooner or later hed find the right girl to settle down with him and that girl stepped into his elevator one rainy morning in midoctober without even bothering to nod at him he was old on the job now and in his lanky countryboy fashion had even acquired a bit of polish being tall and slender with the flat hips and wide sweeping shoulders of a flashing halfback his uniform hung well on him he got along with the other operators did his job well and banked what little he could after paying the rent and lending lem five here and there his account was slow shaping up but he really didnt mind the money spent on lem for in addition to his generous nature he was well aware that whatever lems motives he had done him a great favor by taking him in when he was down to his last dollar and despite lems constant ribbing jamie was grateful for his companionship for he found the ways of the city baffling indeed though constantly surrounded by people he had never been lonelier in his entire life his coworkers were friendly but they were not his friends and those faceless bodies who poured into his car day after day really didnt know him from a crack in the wall then at five oclock sharp the whole horde fled from the building as if it were enveloped in flames then retha hodges glided into his elevator breaking the shackles from his haunted heart yet already he was her willing slave had she but known it at lunch time he caught sight of her again briefly for she took the late lunch when the crowd reached its peak and was soon swallowed up he glared at the hungry mob surging past him and for one awful moment his vexation was such that he thought of taking the whole load to the basement and leaving them to find their way up the best they could at five oclock he missed her completely and was so shaken that he actually toyed with the idea of asking ben their starter about her but by the time he was free ben had vanished as had practically every other soul in the huge building when he finally pushed through the revolving doors dusk had firmly set in and mumbling to himself he slowly made his way to the corner where he waited for the light to change banging his fists one against the other he stared up at the darkened tower of city hall where a host of unseen starlings chattered madly like women at a bridge party then glared at the long succession of jersey buses inching around the corner spitefully blocking his way unaware that he was not going anywhere anyway as lem was only too willing to point out he was standing still in his own little rut damn lem damn him to hell he muttered startling several pedestrians standing near him then he whirled and blindly walked in the opposite direction si v in no time at all she was smiling at him and he had even managed to learn her name but then he made no further progress whatsoever and daily he grew more desperate he simply had to make her aware of him as a person not as just another operator yet the more he pondered the situation the more insoluble it seemed then against his better judgment he sought advice from lem man youd better let that chick alone said lem standing flatfooted in yellow striped socks and flowered undershorts dont you know them whitecollar broads are the worse skirts under th sun theyre looking for some square wholl set em up in the suburbs like theyre queen of th may he yanked the stogie from his mouth forget that broad man and come on down to th timbers with me where you can get your kicks without paying with your own blood jamie already in bed snorted furiously what make you think you know so damn much you always talking outta both sides of your mouth but you aint got no more than i got lem cackled as he strutted over to the bed man i told you before aint none of us got nothing and we aint ever going to git nothing so why dont you stop whining that broad you lusting after aint thinking bout you her folks done sent her to college and they expects her to marry somebody with more education than she got i bet you anything if she aint already got her eye on some lawyer or some teacher she got some joker stashed away in medical school man her folks aint gonna have nobody like you messin round anybody like her jamie swung with the pillow then but lem ducked away laughing fiendishly and scooted up the hall to the bathroom the next day was rainy and dreary and jamies spirits were exceedingly low for somehow that morning he had missed seeing retha around ten he took his break and skitted through the damp mist down to the corner cafeteria he had not had breakfast and briefly as he moved through the line he considered buying bacon and eggs but his stomach rebelled so he settled for two cups of coffee then as he sauntered away from the cashier he thought how nice if one of the cups were for retha so vivid then was the image of her in his mind that when he actually saw her sitting alone he thought surely he was still daydreaming then she smiled and motioned for him to sit with her and his heart took wings despite the horrid clammy weather she sparkled like a newly minted coin and he heard lems sarcastic warning ringing in his ears her folks dont want nobody like you messin round anybody like her but he quickly forgot lem in his desperate effort to find something fetching to say to her almost in the next moment it seemed she had to leave he stood also confused and bedazzled on the verge of leaving with her no please stay and finish your coffee she requested with such delightful charm that he fairly blossomed she laughed then a pure clear sound which fell upon his ears like distant church chimes and then to his utter astonishment he heard her saying that perhaps they would meet again tomorrow at break time jamie left the building the following morning staring down at his feet bleakly wondering if they carried him on still another of his fools errands pushing through the revolving doors he ran down the steps that led into the restaurant he saw her at once sitting at the same table joy transformed his face and for the moment his shyness left him i missed you this morning he said i thought maybe you didnt come in i came early she said the work has piled up tremendously then she nodded toward the counter dont you want coffee today he moved his chair closer his eyes devouring her face naw i dont drink it much he answered not really concentrating on what he was saying i hadnt et breakfast yesterday a faint flush stained her cheeks and instantly he was conscious of his speech people like her didnt use words like et and he didnt usually any more in charlotte before he met caro he had gone to night school for two years but maybe hed better hunt around for something to brush up again he couldnt have his girl blushing at his bad language retha gave him a dazzling smile but his selfdoubts had tied his tongue now then in one of the most exquisite gestures hed ever seen she lifted her hand and touched his own as it quivered near the sugar container i have to leave now jamie were terribly rushed just now but tomorrow perhaps her dark eyes slipped into his and he felt her hand warm and soft and burning him to his very soul and he was so filled with love for her he could have wept thereafter morning coffee became a habit with them and soon they were lunching together his shyness with her all but vanished as he gained more knowledge of her life away from the building but in spite of all the moments spent together at break and luncheon after work ended retha hodges was still as lost to him as the moon for a while he convinced himself that this was only a temporary situation and spent his evenings exploring the city sometimes even venturing into one of the movie houses on chestnut street but it was no good in the movies alone when your girl is god only knows where so he decided to spend his free time on another selfimprovement kick wandering into learys one evening he came across a used english textbook but not until he noted the gleam in lems eyes did he realize his error in bringing the book home for up until that very moment he had given lem the impression that the girl on the job no longer interested him lem swooped the book up from its wrappings and waved it high above his head man what you doing with this junk english essentials you gonna ruin your brains if you got any you talk all right almost as good as me then he made as if to throw the book into the waste basket and jamie hopped up with a violent start lem laughed then laid the book on the dresser but jamies nerves remained coiled for he knew lem wasnt through with the matter and he was in the right mood for getting things off his chest too then as he stood ready for battle the solution to the problem of seeing retha after work suddenly came to him he would get a place of his own and the idea such a remote possibility minutes before and now so very real filled him with exultation lem saw the moist brown eyes come to life as the thin angular face glowed from an inner fire and for the first time he realized that jamie might soon move out of his reach so youre still messing round that broad from west philly huh he exclaimed as he flung himself into the chair and ran a finger along the pencilmark mustache man shes gonna cut your guts out and wear em for beads i thought you had some sense but jamie did not move nor had the slight smile of wonder left his face and lem knew he was on the wrong track he knocked the ashes from his cigar then pointed it at jamie i guess you know the only way you can get to first base with a dame like that is to have folding cabbage and lots of it jamie knew what lem was building up to but in spite of himself he listened indeed hed been thinking along similar lines himself his eyes grew moody his lips took on a pouting look his common sense told him that retha hodges wouldnt touch him with a tenfoot pole if he got mixed up with the numbers but would she ever have to know lem lit a fresh stogie but kept one eye on jamie to know just when to bring on his clincher then finally he stood up tell you what he began suppose we walk down to th timbers later on i hear ike might drop by sometime tonight and you know he cant hold that book open forever hes losing money man that territorys worth a day if its worth a penny jamies heart thumped like a kettle drum he wished lem would shut up yet desperately he wanted to know how much hed make with such a book the take home pay he got now hardly took him around the corner then finally the walls and the ceiling closed in on him i think ill take a walk he said grabbing frantically for his jacket ill see you later with his cigar delicately poised like a stunted foil lem came forward at the timbers he asked softly jamie hesitated maybe and he practically ran from the room the mild november night hung heavily on his shoulders as he moved wearily down the avenue toward broad street he had little idea where he was going and couldnt care less if retha hodges were not with him then the need to see and talk with her overwhelmed him he found a phone booth in a crowded cutrate drug store and called her she agreed to meet him at a bar out on girard avenue near th street she was waiting for him and he was so glad to see her his voice left him momentarily its late he said finally i know you ought to be home she shook her head its not quite eleven i live just around the corner his heart thudded at the mention of how near her home was to him then he asked the question that was burning a hole in his brain if i had a place would you come to see me sometime she regarded him for a long moment and he wasnt sure whether she wanted to laugh or spit in his face then she smiled and told him she would perhaps sometime he tried to grin but didnt quite make it its not good enough he thought despairingly but it was better than an outright no but what he really wanted to know he couldnt ask or rather didnt want to risk having answered but still but still i love you he blurted out before he was aware the words had even formed on his tongue i know she said quietly then looked away from him damn he thought frantically damn damn damn wasnt she going to say anything more then she spoke again and brought the roof down on his head jamie im engaged to a fellow in law school hes my brothers room mate at howard howard howard university in washington she told him he finishes in june we plan to marry then oh jamie said and the word took off swirling around the room like a stunned insect oh he finally said again his mind unable to think of any other word his heart a ton of lead threatening to pull him through the floor she touched his hand dont look like that jamie i know i should have told you earlier but i kept putting it off thinking that once you werent soso alone maybe you could better cope with the situation he stood in front of the timbers bar a tall lonely figure fingering the change in his pocket the november air was chilled now cutting through his jacket but he seemed not to notice then lem came out and confronted him i been looking for you man come on in ikes waiting but jamie merely shook his head his eyes squinting at the dimly outlined lem i just came to let you know im cutting out he said finally then before lem could reply jamie turned and walked on down the avenue his shoulders bent against the night seek audacious power by adam clayton powell lmost years ago that question was a contemptuous a f inquiry in the book of john and nathanael said unto philip can there any good thing come out of nazareth e philip saith come and see nazareth was the mississippi of galilee there were no great artists or philosopherkings or musicians there was no center of learning such as howard university in this commencement of your life the world will ask can there any good thing come out of howard as black students educated at americas finest black institution of higher learning you are still secondclass citizens a mere years in the spectrum of time separates us from the history of slavery and a lifetime of indignities next year on march howard will celebrate the centennial of its founding next year on march the committee on education and labor of which i am the chairman will also celebrate its th anniversary how ironic that the committee on education and labor which was formed immediately after the civil war to help black slaves make the transition into freedom should have a black man years later as its chairman one of the purposes of the committees founding was to take care of howard university it is too late for you who are graduating to know this unless you plan to pursue graduate work here but it is not too late for the faculty to know it the education and labor committee is in charge of howard university howard along with other federal institutions such as st elizabeths and gallaudet college is under the jurisdiction of my committee while both howard and i as chairman of this committee will celebrate our years together joy of our success is tempered by the sobering fact that our status as black people has been denied firstclass acceptance keith e baird writing in the spring edition of freedomways gives eloquent voice to these thoughts in his poem nemesis you snatched me from my land branded my body with your irons and my soul with the slavename negro how devilish clever to spell it upper case and keep me always lower to possess a black skin today in america means that if you are in los angeles driving your pregnant wife to a hospital youll be shot to death by a white policeman a black skin means that if your family lives in webster county mississippi your average family income will be a year a week for an entire family a black skin today is an unemployment rate twice that of whites despite a skyrocketing gross national product of billion dollars and an unprecedented level of employment a black skin means you are still a child that all the white liberals who have helped you to take your first steps toward freedom and manhood now believe they own your soul can manage your lives and control your civil_rights organizations only snick has been able to resist the seductive blandishments of white liberals so beware not only of greeks bearing gifts but colored men seeking loans and northern white liberals at this graduation today this is the reality of self you must face your graduation comes at a particularly critical period of the black mans searching reassessment of who he is what he should become and how he should become it the history of the last years of the freedom struggle has been capsuled in only two concepts integration and civil_rights during those years our leadersand black people are the only people who have leadersother groups have politicians statesmen educators financiers and businessmenbut during those years our leaders drugged us with the lsd of integration instead of telling us to seek audacious powermore black_powerinstead of leading us in the pursuit of excellence our leaders led us in the sterile chase of integration as an end in itself in the debasing notion that a few white skins sprinkled amongst us would somehow elevate the genetics of our development as a result ours was an integration of intellectual mediocrity economic inferiority and political subservience like frightened children we were afraid to eat the strong meat of human rights and instead sucked the milk of civil_rights from the breasts of white liberals black uncle toms and aunt jemimas from the book of hebrews a diet of courage is offered to black people for every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil historically strong meat was too risky for most black people for it would have enabled them to discern both good and evil the difference between civil_rights and human rights human rights are godgiven civil_rights are manmade civil_rights has been that grand deception practiced by those who have not placed god first who have not believed that godgiven rights can empower the black man with superiority as well as equality our life must be purposed to implement human rights the right to be secure in ones person from the excessive abuses of the state and its lawenforcing officials the right to freedom of choice of a job to feed ones family the right to freedom of mobility of residence the right to the finest education mans social order can provide and most importantly the right to share fully in the governing councils of the state as equal members of the body politic to demand these godgiven human rights is to seek black_power what i call audacious powerthe power to build black institutions of splendid achievement howard university was once well on its way toward becoming a lasting black institution of splendid achievement when it struggled to contain the intellectual excitement and dynamic creativity of such black scholars as alain locke sterling brown e franklin frazier sam dorsey eugene holmes james nabrit and rayford logan all on the campus at the same time what glorious symbols they were of black creativity but where are the black symbols of creativity of where is the greatness of our yesteryears where are the sonnets black poets once sung of the black mans agony of life can any good thing come out of howard today iv there can and there must i call today for a black renaissance at howard university resurrect black creativity not only in literature history law poetry and english but more so in mathematics engineering aerodynamics and nuclear physics like nicodemus howard must be born againborn again in the image of black greatness gone before will one black woman here today dare to come forth as a pilgrim of god a sojourner truthas a black moses harriet tubmanor a nannie burroughs will one black man here today dare be a denmark vesey a nat turner a frederick douglass a marcus garvey a w e b dubois or a malcolm_x one with god is a majority this divine oneness can restore howard to the glory of charlie houston whose classrooms were the womb of the civil_rights movementa womb that birthed a thurgood marshall but the womb has aborted and the good thing which nvt r rhoward must also come out of black peop v ask yourselves that higher question can any good thing come of black people we are the last revolutionaries in americathe last transfusion of freedom into the blood stream of democracy because we are we must mobilize our wintry discontent to transform the cold heart and white face of this nation indeed we must drop our buckets where we are we must stop blaming whitey for all our sins and oppressions and deal from situations with strength why sit down at the bargaining table with the white man when you have nothing with which to bargain why permit social workers and various leagues and associations to represent us when they are representing the decadent white power structure which pays their salaries their rent and tells them what to say such men cannot possess the noble arrogance of power that inspires men moves nations and decides the fate of mankind i call for more arrogance of power among black people but an arrogance of power that is godinspired godled and goddaring as cassius said the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in yourselves that we are underlings so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity we can cancel the captivity of our souls and destroy the enslavement of our minds by refusing to compromise any of our human rights the era of compromise for the black man is gone birmingham harlem and watts have proved this you cannot compromise mans right to be free nor can you sit down and reason together whether man should have some rights today and full rights tomorrow let somebody reason with mrs barbara deadwyler in los angeles that a white policeman really did not intend to kill her black husband let somebody tell her that the passion of her love for her husband should bow to the reason of diaphanous official alibis only god can reason with her and soothe her grief and there is a god who rules above with a hand of power and a heart of love and if im right hell fight my battle and i shall be free this day this same god calls us first to the conference table and his son when the word of reason was no longer heeded went into the temple and began to cast out those that sold those who sell black people down the river must be cast out those conference tables which defile the human spirit must be overturned conferences are for people who have time to contemplate the number of angels dancing on a civil_rights pin conferences are for people who seek a postponement until tomorrow of a decision which screams for a solution today conferences are an extravagant orgy of therapy for the guiltridden and a purposeless exercise in dialectics for the lazy america has been holding too many conferences conducting too many seminars writing too many books and articles about the black man and his right to freedom for over a century this week black and white people will gather once again in our nations capital to whisper words of futility into the hurricane of massive indifference certainly the federal government should cease to be a partner in this cruel historic charade with the black mans rights to fulfill these rights let us begin with first things first the largest single employer in the united states is the federal government employees yet racial discrimination within the government more subtle more sophisticated more elegantly structuredcontinues almost as rampant as yesterday the times have changed but the system hasnt though racial persecution presses its crown of thorns on our brows our faith in god must never falter we must sustain that faith which helps us to cast off the leprosy of selfshame in our black skins and lift us up to the glorious healing power of belief in the excellence of black_power we must have the faith to build mighty black universities black businesses and elect black men as governors mayors and senators our faith must be sustained by our passion for dignity and our trust in god not mans faithless reason in himself what is easierto say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk black children of howard take up thy beds and walk into the new era of excellence arise and walk into a new spirit of black pride can there any good thing come out of nazareth come and see said philip nathanael came and saw jesus and the world felt as he did the power of his love and the beauty of his words can there any good thing come out of howard university here today come and see you howard graduates must say come and see us erect skyscrapers of economic accomplishment scale mountains of educational excellence and live among the stars of audacious political power come and see us labor for the black massesnot the black leadersbut the black masses who have yearned for audacious leadership violenci in america by dr karl menninger interest in semantics makes me very uncomfortable j f to hear the word violence used as if it were equivalent to iwll lawlessness and the word violence used as if it were equivad d lent to crime or equivalent to murder these are all such different things that im uneasy about the abstraction violence as describing a lot of things that we usually dont like thats why i thought it would be useful if we put down the sort of violence that we disapproved of as a teaching device i often like to change the nature of the reduction suppose we talk about a poker game that seems frivolous enough violence in a poker game is not a very serious matter but lawlessness is perhaps youre not westerners enough to know this nobody gets thrown out of a poker game for violenceperhaps they shouldbut they do for lawlessness once break the rules in a gentlemans game and youre out you can be as violent as you please if the walls will stand it and the furniture will stand it well within limits now in a way this is an example of what errors i think we get into when we keep talking about violence and lawlessness i have only taken two i talked with dr satten and perhaps he will make some further distinctions between words which we in psychiatry use with a good deal more conscientious caution we dont accuse an individual of being violent when he has only been lawless or vice versa then we take a shocking examplelets compare for example the assassination of julius caesar to the assassination of president kennedy i happen to have been like most of my fellow americans a great admirer of mr kennedy and i think the tragedy of his death is almost beyond any words that we could utter but lets look at the fact that the assassination was not very violent all the man did was slightly move his finger whereas brutus had to charge up the steps with the dagger in his hand face the man he was about to kill tell him what he was doing it for and kill him now this glorification of violence which is our heritage as the historian said and which we have praised for centuries as being the earmarks of courage virility manliness and anything else certainly come under a cloud were denouncing violence when i think we mean to denounce something elsedestructivenesswhich usually today is nonviolent most destructiveness today is not accomplished by violence violence is for little fellows violence is for the people that dont know any better violence is like common sense its what the average man has to deal with but destructiveness can now be expressed in such mechanical ways such remote ways such magic ways that our concern it seems to me is actually not so much with violence as with something inside of us which makes us destructive and which makes us willing to be lawless or sadistic or criminal or whatever necessary if we can some way or other make the end justify any means professor freud after spending a lifetime educating his students and the public to the idea that there were within us repressed sexual feelings which caused some of us trouble came to a sudden realization when he was well past middle age and said to his associates gentlemen my critics have said i was too preoccupied with sex and i think they are right now there is something inside the human breast which is also repressed which causes more trouble than sexual frustrations and that is the propensity of human beings to hurt one another to be destructive to be aggressive freud then postulated the dual instinct theory which many of his followers did not accept but which i and many of my friends think is essential you see if you take the view that civilization has in a sense been the progressive repudiation and relinquishing of certain natural trends in the human being you might say civilization goes constantly against the natural law not in the catholic sense but in the psychological sense it seems to be natural for animals including ourselves to assert our own need to try to attain by whatever means necessary what we want when will we learn gradually both in the childhood of the individual and in the childhood of the race that you have to make concessions to the needs of other people you can go even furtheryou can even enjoy making such concessions thats the beginning of the development of the psychological maturity of the individual and the race which puts agape ahead of eros which puts concern ahead of the other person ahead of even the expediency of being good to the other person because he then might be good to you we havent reached it very generally to be sure but we have gone far enough to let me put it another waycivilization has gone to the point where it no longer glorifies aggression as it did its a little ashamed of its violence and its aggression and it does by machinery what it used to do by hand in this sense violence decreases at the wrong place you might say i think if executions were done today as they originally were done in public so that you would see the official violence committed by the state there would be fewer of them even though we know that the desire to see and enjoy violence vicariously is in all of us one of the gentlemen said we tolerate a little violence ladies and gentlemen we not only tolerate it we love it its exciting we put it in the front page of the paper a third or a fourth of our television programs for the amusement of the children are exhibitions of how you can slug them how you can knock them out how you can kick them how you can kill them at long distance or short distance this is what we think is exciting dont forget that violence is condoned my dear friends its enjoyedahproviding theres some escape clause you know in all navaho rugs to give you a little change of mood for a moment the skillful weavers leave one strand of the weaving carried from the simple theme to the edge of the rugwhat looks to nonnavahos as some kind of mistake this is not a mistake this is an alibi this is a way out this is a way to say i havent given away tribal secrets this is the way for the magic of the rug to escape the escape clause so to speak now theres an escape clause in all our violence todaythe forms of violence we can still enjoy a typical illustration of this is the prize fight it seems negligible unimportant and so forth now you see it isnt if you think of this as an example in which the enjoyment of violence can still be permitted even though it is murderous it is mayhem it is corruption as you all know economically it is about everything you could name ordinarily as bad but if it has a name of the right sort if it has a conventional history if it gets by as an escape it is a way in which we can bring the most brutal and aggressive violence right into our livingroom few people today would want to go out and take two of the largest dogs in the community and put them in a pen and see them fight to death this is not quite done according to the rules we dont do it that way weve other ways of being cruel no farmer today would enjoy having two of his bulls gore each other to death but put it in the right auspices and this is lots of fun people think this is wonderful and a large number of our people want to see it extended i think these examples will give you a clue to my own feeling about it and that is that i think it is inevitable who will take the position that all aggression is as judge bazelon says bad it wont be a matter of seeking what kind of aggression can i find today that will be good ill do a little good aggression today but the bad aggression is all the other peoples well get them into court as fast as possible and stop it if one sees aggression in the literal sense the wish to hurt injure other people whether they are criminals whether they are indians or other life whether they are animals living their own peaceful existence whether they are children whatever the other form our task is to eliminate as far as we can to control to harness to sublimate to direct our own aggressive impulses and that of our colleagues away from the enjoyment of causing pain in other people i dont believe there is such a thing as good aggression now youre going to say to me well now arent you carrying this too far what would you do if somebody came to your house and wanted to kill your children wouldnt you be aggressive of course i would i dont say that all occasions for the necessary use of something bad have disappeared i wouldnt ordinarily crawl out through the top of an elevator car for athletic amusement but i did last week in new york because we got stuck between floors and remained there for a half an hour i did some very extraordinary things that i wouldnt ordinarily do i would say if somebody comes to my house and attacks me i shall exercise myself as vigorously as possible however in the meantime i dont intend to provide an arsenal and dont intend to stock up with a number of guns revolvers and other weapons so that i can keep the villain out personally i think this would be a thin disguise for my own aggressive impulses that almost it seems to me would be inviting some masochist to come in and see if i can hit him im not going to experiment i dont think in psychiatry generally there is an agreement with so flatfooted a quaker position as i take if you stop to think the joys of yesteryear were largely those of killing something in my part of the country especially a little further west most of the northern california indians were shot off as a matter of sport by your ancestors and mine who lived there it was considered good weekend fun to go out and kill a few indians as a hunting exercise the same thing was done in many other places but this was so well documented one whole large tribe was exterminated just north of here a little way you must remember that this was done with the blessing of the community of course some of the women thought it was a rather rough sport it would be much better if their husbands stayed home and knocked each other out in a slug fest or something but some of the boys wanted to go out and get a little blood and they did you see i find it quite foreign to my concept of psychiatry to regard these to discount this as being the work of the psychotic population my dear friends i think were all a psychotic population there is no such thing as the psychotic population mental illness is a condition from which everyone of us suffers at one time or another to different degrees and it is neither thee nor thou business or me and thou business to say well those psychotic people theyre the ones that do these things you and i are the psychotic people in the sense that you and i are the ones who are aware that there are fluctuations in our ability to organize and manage our aggressions and the temptations of the outside world some people are less aware of this fact but i think that this holierthanthou attitude toward the psychiatrically ill is incorrect im not going to take a holierthanthou attitude toward the attitude i only make the distinction that i dont think this is the correct way to see it if you take such a survey as that manhattan survey you realize it mental illness is not something that unfortunately drops down on a few individuals like lee harvey oswald and causes him to do surreptitious things mental illness is something that afflicts all of us to some degree all of us at times and many people all of the timeor much of the time with constant fluctuation this view of psychiatry is so different from the old one where we thought we could go through the population and pick out maybe one or three or four out of a thousand who needed the care of the state institution or the boston psychopathic this view of psychiatry is as dead as a dodo we recognize now that this was a limitation of our vision at that time just as we recognize now that shooting off indians at the time when there was a mutualrobbery program going on was the feud of it i often think in sunday school in bible classes how different it looks when you think of the children of israel conquering jericho and marching forth against the occupants how different it looks if you imagine yourself to be a descendant of the occupants the same way the american indians how different it looks if you are a descendant of the navahosless the navahos than the sioux let us say with whom i have spent some time if you look at it from their point how different it looks the war in which custer and others so bravely exterminated the fiendish savage if you happen to be on the other side think how the indians felt about people who felt that it was their privilege to come in and steal your stuff but it was not your privilege to steal theirs here we are a nation that violated treaties with the indians who never once broke their side of the contract when one talks about lawlessness and violence you must remember as our historian said this has been a pattern which we havent been until recently very much ashamed of you heard it in the political campaign and you hear it in my part of the country quite a bit by god im going to do so and so the very tone of voice is a kind of violence a kind of confession that i do not recognize the necessity to control violence i regard violence as something without which on this rough planet you cant live and im going to observe it in the right way in my judgment of course now these remarks are tendentious and they are not intended to be a calm cold scientific analysis of the topic partly as i say because i think we havent sufficiently clearly identified our topic our kind host said that he was thinking of the kind that seemed unmotivated but if i may terminate what ive been saying by direct reference to that i think that is only because you and i are not close enough to that individual to know what the motives were what seems senseless to us is because we dont know man it isnt the way i would have killed those people it isnt the way that i would have acted on that elevator but i am not he i didnt have the background he did i didnt have the frustrations he did i didnt have the irritations he did i didnt have the insults flung in my face that hes had im imagining a situation but my point is that cases that seem inexplicable to use are so partly because were assuming that the life the background the experiences the motions the suffering of the individuals who do these terrible things that make us shudder with horror are not the same as ours if we mean therefore to study violence we must study the people that cant get along that cant cope with the realities of life in a civilized way i think dr satten my colleague here has contributed something very important in the scientific american article where he points out that our attitude towards offenders has been almost one of saying since i cant understand you i am angry at you therefore i am not willing to try to help you change i only want you punished this conventional attitude should be corrected judge bazelon has been trying to do it for a few individuals sooner or later it seems to me it ought to be an expression of our civilization that we are not interested in returning violence for violence that we are interested in trying to bring about change in the people who cant live in a way that will allow us to be safe especially as we get closer together out west where there are greater spaces where it takes longer for the bad news to spread where people can get away with more without being caught by their neighbors its a different matter from where we live just apartment to apartment now that more people see what human beings act like when theyre a little off guard when they are a little stimulated by you and when they have been a little deficient in the civilizing process there is more interest in trying to find better ways to control a the people who fail to control themselves and commit violence and b those who might do so under the right circumstances which includes all of us its in the game by lucille clifton sr eric berne firl missed what might n j j j have been the most provocative and contemporary chapter of all in his currently popular book games people play when he failed to include in it any examples of the games sweeping the circuit of newly integrated neighborhoods there are many they usually in their elementary form involve two players often nextdoor neighbors and women and always one black and one white it is the basic and most important rule one of the most popular is called what she would have said in the old neighborhood and black housewife as usual is it for example white housewife your hair is lovely did you do it yourself black housewife thank you it was getting so dry and unmanageable that i simply had to give myself a permanent black dialogue learned to read early when many of the other kids were h outside playing ball or swinging on the playground swingsbefore the time of tvhe was usually curled up with a book of course he played ball and romped with his succession of dogs and skated but he also read and reading took the place a lot of the time of building model airplanes or doing what other seven or eightyearold negroes do the first book his mother gave him was black boy she had always read to him until he had gotten too big and then she began getting him books from the library but black boy was the first book she bought particularly for him she hardly ever told him about the world about what to look for in life unless it was a part of her vision of the promising future he guessed her ways were to be a protection for him but later the only thing he felt they had done was to have him disbelieve in dreams whenever he grew old enough to be made aware of something like sex or that he was a negro and he would be treated differently in the world because of this phenomenon she left him a book on his night table and so she gave him black boy by richard wright to enlighten him and his life long held recurrences of that horrible experience after he had read the autobiography of richard wright he had been psychologically unable to read another negro author for over ten years but his mother never knew and he didnt even admit the fact to himself he had just refused to believe there were any other negro writers and that made it unnecessary even accidentally to relive the trauma of black boy he immediately stopped reading harmless frank yerby when he found that yerby was a negro and he refused until his late teens to read books by whites with negro themes and subjects it was frightening to believe almost everything that one read not that he should not believe an autobiography he told himself but he believed literally in the characters of books when young and in their situations but unfortunately these characters were almost always white no tom sawyer or huck finn for him there were blackmen in them come back up on the raft huck honey the monstrous life that wright portrayed in that book could as well have been histhis was one of the fears he screamed of at night in all his reading until then and most since except for whitman that was the single character with which he felt a definite spiritual kinship and he attempted to strangle that apparitions first breath his hands are still partially encircling its black throat the description of wrights whitelooking grandmother was like those he had heard of some of his distant relatives and he did have a very fair aunt with long stringy hair who was old enough to be a grandmother and the entire similarity scared him more thoroughly than all the promised damnations of hell in the bible he did not understand why he compared that experience of reading black boy to cringing under the denunciations of the ancient prophets and fearing for the immortal everlasting soul he believed in then but reading that book he somehow feared for himself as he has few times since could it be that in both cases he would be equally lost was to be black to be told and demonstrated in graphic detail equivalent to smelling fire and brimstone to be among the unsaved it cant be this way his childs mind reasoned i wont believe it is like this i dont live like this no one does at least no one i know so what is this man in this book saying these things for what is he doing to me why is he trying to destroy me with all his will he fought the accusations of living in a false world of childhood and adolescent comfort and smugness but he knew that man spoke the truth that that black man was right that things he described in such brutal detail did really happenonly in a different place he could not believe that such things confronted him down south thats it he reasoned down south for he had heard of down home numerous occasions through tale jest and tabletalk of the elders though he could not imagine where the country was or if it were actually a real place or an illusionary one like the story lands of ghosts and witches and trolls he never knew until much later that he was alreadyand soon would be even moreacquainted with the south and he had such a fear and hate instilled in him for down home that even much later it was vital for him to be objective and not allow prejudice to infect his feelings when he met someone with a hard southern accentwhether they were black or white but most of his newer friends were recently arrived from down home and the way in which they spoke of the land they had fled it was a distant wonderland far superior toand unlikethe then fabulous farm in new jersey of his nearly white aunt they must lie he felt he knew they lied and he secretly hated them the more for their trying to deceive him his new friends from the south acted differently so strange and awkward their first years in the city and not like himself who knew the citys ways he thought then and some of these new friends have never changed he wasnt afraid to speak to whites or shy in their presence like many of his friends were no he went to school with whites everyday and would punch one in the mouth if he wasnt his friend or if he had gotten out of line he even walked sylvia greenglass home each day of his next to last year in elementary school carrying her books and sometimes staying late at her house for the hot creamy chocolate that her mother made on chilly days sylvia with the auburn hair and pink cheeks and ears that brightened crimson in the wintertime he thought of that day when he walked her home and his friends from school threw snowballs at them and sylvia and he laughed and trotted along with him stooping in the cold scooping up the icy whiteness and returning the volleys at brother and timmy his two friends up seventh street yelling and panting out clouds of steam until one of the snowballs hit sylvias ear the instance froze like it was etched by icicles to freeze his heart then sylvia and he hurried the last six blocks to her house as she cried and his knowing that it was an awful accident which found him helpless after the damage was done but he whispered to himself that he could have prevented it by being nearer her warding off the balls of snow and ice he couldnt explain to mrs greenglass when she opened the door sylvia stood there on the landing whimpering and sputtering about her ear and he begged forgiveness as if he had made the little pink girl his target her mother did not invite him in that afternoon nor any other and sylvia stopped playing with him at recess nor would she allow him to walk her home again he hated the ones who threw at them that afternoon hated them for causing the trouble but they were his friends brother and timmy the other two negroes in the school they called themselves colored in those days he hated his two friends for parting him from a white girl the game today is being probably still played with the exact results brother had a soft southern accent and had been only in the city for a couple years but brother knew more things about the streets and how its people acted than he did they remained friends for over ten years but to him brother was always a southern negro a newcomer and so not really a friend timmy was from a family with a lot of kids and his big brothers always threatened to beat him up and take his possessions until he got big enough not to take threats from anyone to him he seemed long in getting that big but the day came when he couldnt allow any more sleights to go unchallenged and during the course of those years he had lost all those old friends and no others had he hated so much nor has he met since that have replaced them it has been always too easy for him to take up with the white world it has been always too easy to find some sort of acceptance from whites somehow he had learned to speak in a close enough approximation to their way his reading had conditioned him to search in the world for many of their values he had gone to the same schools with them being for the first six years the single negro in his classes and always near the top that type of conditioning is murderous to throw off at once it is subtle and almost sure in most cases to twist a black soul into a hybrid freak of some kind it lulls the victim into refusing to see the darker aspects of the world it gives him a pair of second false blue eyes to gaze distortedly through a black caught like this gets to thinking that white people are all right which isnt hard to believe when he is far enough out of the mans reach and his mother has a civil service job but then later when he grows up there are other factors to consider weird factors which lead to the edge of insanity he wonders after a while and he tries again to reorganize his multihued funnypaper collaged world with strictly white values thinking white logic with blackwhite experiences and often he becomes bitter or skeptical or worse especially when he finds it is other blacks closer to him doing him more obvious treachery than the whites when he finds that he is not white even though his mind wishes to believe there is a sameness that his inner black eyes cannot detect he wishes to stop believing in justice fair play honor and truth why did they prepare me only for this lie he wonders when one finds he must become unfeeling out of a sense of protection as those who do not feel nor wish to know or feel then sometimes he turns his back upon his own people and upon himself and becomes all the more disillusioned for that is when he is really alone and is lost the white world prepares the black man in a single universal skill treachery to his fellows v no man lies to a black man more than another black man no man cheats or is ready to kill another black man as quickly as another black man one must become accustomed to the perplexities of this brotherhood if he is to survive and learn and understand why one must lose faith for faith is never quite enough one must throw away belief for belief is held by every black fool one must be blown apart by all that one has been taught and reassembled in the vacuum of ignoranceofblack to form the vessel of new experience there is not a white man alone he feared to face though he is wary of each of his black brothers for ancient betrayal waits behind each smile and set of dark eyes all white groups he enters with caution for the collective will of their numbers is to keep him in his place whether it is in front of the firing squad or standing at a poduim before an expanse of equally black faces no black group does he fear but it is the influence of the manipulators in the outer wings which he cares to avoid it is as true today as it was years ago in this land blacks meet together only because some white desires their congregation and blacks are compelled to seek fraternity through the urging of white sympathizers and exploiters the black man in america is the loneliest human in the universe and he can sense freedom most in his loneliness when he is unencumbered by the society of his fellow blacks who are unwittingly guided by whites he transition from sprinter on a u s olympic

anachronism cztkra j n a ge verba j antiimperialism but that precisely is what i propose to doalthough in truth both the rationale and method of my suggested expansionis i are somewhat unique from the war for independence until the s the united states was one of the most expansionistic nations on earth rivaling the british french and russian empires in the relationship of original size to the extent of new territory added unlike the typical european government however the united states followed a policy of absorbing the new territories as integral parts of the nation as states subject only to the limitation that angloamericans had to predominate over natives thus statehood was never available to indians or to native hawaiians and oklahoma new mexico arizona hawaii and alaska all had to wait until the nonwhites had become sufficiently outnumbered or anglicized and neutralized angloamerican imperialism assumed a new form precisely when it came into contact with regions inhabited by nonwhites who were too numerous to be outnumbered where angloamericans could never predominate generally speaking the flag could not go this racist and ethnocentric doctrine ironically was a major factor in saving mexico in the s hawaii temporarily in the s the dominican republic in the s and probably cuba the philippines and other regions at a later date nevertheless imperialism continued but it assumed the form of acquiring economic and political dominance over foreign nations without formal annexation the united states was freed from the problem of reconciling the constitution with colonialism does the constitution follow the flag and freed from facing up to the ideal that all u s territories possess a right to eventual statehood the united states in brief established a protectorate over much of the americas and more recently over the pacific area and was thus able to benefit from empire without being forced to face the problems posed by the direct administration of subject peoples except of course in the philippines samoa puerto rico the canal zone guam hawaii and the various indian tribal regions this protectorate system continues to exist especially in relation to the caribbean region president lyndon b johnson both in sending marines to intervene in a purely internal rebellion and in asserting the united states right to intervene anywhere in the americas has reaffirmed the old teddy roosevelt philosophy but in addition to this straightforward presidential policy the united states has long used ambassadors aid programs and the cia to influence other governments and of course most of the caribbean nations are economically dominated by the united states the ironic effect of the above is that the dominican republic and the other small nations of the caribbean would possess more freedom from federal u s interference and greater autonomy as states of the united states than they do as socalled independent republics as states they would be protected by the constitution and by the courts they could socialize the economy by confiscating illegallyacquired private property and they could elect senators and representatives who would have an impact on federal policies as republics they are not protected by the constitutions separation of powers doctrinethey are subject to federal u s intervention without constitutional restraint they are in short subjected to behavior which would never be tolerated by a sovereign state of the united states is this reasoning false then let us for a moment contrast the sovereignty of states such as mississippi and alabama with that of the dominican republic the former are states wherein virtually half the population is subjected to violence is held in a subordinate status and is denied the right to exercise constitutional privileges the governments of mississippi and alabama are in fact in a state of rebellion against the united states even to the extent of the flying of a rebel flag and the wearing of rebel insignias in alabama but has this led to intervention has president johnson dispatched marines to protect american lives and to separate the antagonists has federal power been exerted to organize coalition whitenegro governments it is generally true that the federal government rarely intervenes in the affairs of states even in the face of the most blatant provocations little rock and oxford being notable and rather smallscale exceptions on the other hand the federal government finds it much easier to intervene overseas as it has within our own century in haiti cuba the dominican republic nicaragua panama colombia mexico guatemala and elsewhere the dominican republic unlike mississippi and alabama does not possess representation in congress nor votes in presidential elections as indicated above no constitutional guarantees enforceable by an independent judiciary protect its interests therefore president johnson is able to dispatch marines on a large scale to dominicana to prevent the reestablishment of constitutional government and in fact to dictate the form a new government will assume can anyone imagine such an intervention in the south for these and other reasons to be outlined below i feel that the only decent policy for the united states to pursue is to make formal offers of immedate statehood to dominicana haiti jamaica puerto rico micronesia the ryukyus and to other regions which are either colonies or protectorates of the united states please bear in mind that i do not advocate the unilateral annexation of these areas i merely wish to offer the various protectorates of the united states a choice between their present status subject to the capricious intervention of the federal government and a status wherein they possess an influence upon that government the dominican republic as was cuba prior to castro is in fact a territory of the united states it should be allowed the option of statehood another important point in relation to the caribbean region is that the united states regards the several islands therein as being of such great strategic significance as to be for practical purposes a part of the united states home defense system as things now stand the united states will never allow any of these islands to pursue independent courses of action this is true of cuba as well after all the united states was not kidding in the bay of pigs affair given this reality should not the united states at least offer the west indians the right to vote in presidential elections and thereby have some say in their own security system the caribbean republics have nominally two choices now on the one hand they can remain protectorates of the united states or on the other hand they can seek freedom of action within the context of the communist bloc cuba was able to make that choice the others however will not be able to follow that path for the simple reason that the united states will undoubtedly intervene with full force in any leftwing revolution any attempt therefore to establish other cubas will simply result in the killing of thousands of people and u s military occupation therefore the only realistic alternative to a protectorate status is that of statehood the situation is somewhat different in the case of puerto rico micronesia samoa the canal zone and the ryukhus these regions are already attached to the united states by formal instruments my proposals here are very simple we should encourage the formation of a polynesian federation which samoa can join or as an alternative allow samoa and any of its neighbors to form a state micronesia the trust territory of the pacific and guam should be allowed the option of statehood here no other alternative can be provided since the united states will doubtless never let these islands go for military reasons the ryukyus should be offered the choice of statehood or reunion with japan but the latter is not a likely course of action since the united states seems firmly attached to this military bastion perhaps in this instance it might be possible to create a selfgoverning ryukuan free state under the joint supervision of the united states and japan but in the event that the united states chooses to retain unilateral control what other decent alternative is there to an offer of statehood the case of the canal zone is somewhat unique in that it involves an area not suited for either statehood or independence but then the zone is nothing more or less than u soccupied panama and it should be turned over to the latter if on the other hand military considerations are such that we cannot part with the zone then we should offer panama statehood and the canal that would provide the panamanians with a unified territory and with some say in the control of their own destiny puerto rico is an associated free state or commonwealth of the united states as such it possesses nearly the same powers as a state internally but has no voting representation in washington many people are under the impression that puerto rico can have statehood or independence if she wishes the truth is however that puerto rico could never be independent of the united states except in a strictly formal sense and statehood must be approved by congress rumor from washington has it that congress is not encouraging puerto rico to ask for statehood and it may be that cultural and racial chauvinists are opposed to a state not dominated by angloamericans nevertheless it would be a good gesture for congress to pass an enabling act allowing puerto rico to assume statehood at the latters discretion such a step would help to diminish the worlds suspicion that the united states is intolerant of racial and cultural minorities my advocacy of offers of statehood to all of the aforementioned regions is based on the rather simple principle that all men should possess the right of local selfgovernment and the right to directly participate in the formulation of nonlocal and international policies the peoples of the caribbean micronesia samoa and the ryukyus among others are not allowed one or both of these fundamental rights and it is intolerable that the united states should be the power preventing the exercise of those rights therefore either the united states must cease intervening overseas and give away its colonies or it must pursue forthwith the only decent alternative that of offering statehood and the rights of citizenship to these peoples but in all frankness there are other reasons behind my favoring the growth of the united states for one i am a little afraid of the provincial angloamerican as he is found in his purity especially in the south and middle west i like the white anglosaxon diluted as he is in new york boston new orleans san francisco los angeles santa fe san antonio and all of the other more interesting and culturally more productive regions of the united states i do not care for the middle towns or suburbs where the anglo predominates to the exclusion of other groups and here i include those irishamericans germanamericans et cetera who have become completely anglicized i am frankly worried about the domestic and foreign policies apparently favored by the present consensus among anglo politicians and i am even more frightened by the lunatic right with its notsolatent racist potential in short i believe that we need a new infusion of the kind of invigoration formerly provided by immigration and of the kind of counterbalancing diverse sectional interests favored by madison in the federalist papers for this reason also i would favor union with canada but that is another subject in a similar vein i strongly desire a greater cosmopolitanism within the united states and a more varied cultural atmosphere with increased opportunity for contributions by nonanglos we need the healthy influence of more mulattoes more negroes more mestizos more pacific islanders and more latins and not only are the cultural variations provided by these peoples fascinating and enriching but i personally find that the hybrids who result from the intermingling of such peoples are extremely attractive physically and otherwise there should be more hawaiis more seriously however the united states must rapidly become more cosmopolitan if it is to successfully meet its responsibilities as the leading power in the noncommunist world the american people must become more sophisticated more tolerant and better informed i do believe that union with nonanglo peoples will help not only to demonstrate the existing degree of tolerance in the united states but to actually further the process of cosmopolitanization and sophistication needless to state chauvinists and rightwingers will most certainly oppose my plan for the growth of the united states precisely out of fear of the reasons for which i advocate it they do not want more orientals more negroes more mixedbloods and more race mixture they do not want to see their dear old angloamerican provincial culture further diluted although they will accept pizza above all they do not wish to see votes go to people who might well suppport socialism or economic reform or who will suport strong civil_rights programs or who might well seek to tone down the unilateralism of united states foreign policy and then of course these same people have never really given a hoot about freedom for nonanglos in order to preserve the freedom or advance the interests of angloamericans as they see it they have been perfectly willing to take freedom away from other peoples the opposition of the chauvinists to my plan only serves however to strengthen my faith in its essential wisdom and justice why shouldnt we make a try at it after all an offer of statehood is probably one of the least offensive things that we can do and it may be that the united states is destined to grow again whether or not you or i wish it let us make sure that its growth is by voluntary and legitimate meansand not alone by the progress of marching armies the way i see it by bill veeck e are such hypocrites when alvin dark was quoted as e in team pride cries of righteous indignation filled the air utumirqjiu and yet anyody who has spent any time around ball parks knows that if dark did say what he was quoted as saying he was only echoing what was being muttered on every bench and in every clubhouse it was unfortunate that either alvin did not get down to specifics or that the columnist in quoting him preferred to approach the issue in generalities as a way of opening up the subject to the widest possible discussion and debate it was unfortunate too that because dark himself happens to come from the south anything he might say is evaluated by a completely different set of standards than if hubert humphrey had said it now no one can tell me that alvin didnt know his own ballplayers better than anyone else or that alvin didnt see what he saw if he had said that orlando cepeda who happens to come from puerto rico or that willie mccovey who happens to be an american negro werent the leading candidates for the team player of the year award hed have found any number of baseball people ready to agree with him dark isnt the first manager to feel that cepeda wasnt putting out to the limits of his capabilities nor would he have been the first to say that mccovey tended to lose interest in that rather large portion of the ball game when he wasnt at the plate swinging a bat of course baseball people have always said that jackie brandt doesnt play up to his capabilities either and no one has ever felt it necessary to observe that they sure do grow them lazy in nebraska they just nicknamed him flakey and let it go at that what you always have to bear in mind is that cepeda may very well feel in his heart that he is playing to the peak of his ability at first anyway but human nature is human nature if you keep telling a player he is lazy he just may say to himself all right ill show them how lazy i can be it takes a little imagination to perceive that anybody who is called the baby bull needs coddling and yet i have a strong hunch that if every time a giant manager had felt like blasting cepeda he had called in the newspapermen and told them what a joy it was to have the baby bull on his team things would be a lot calmer along the banks of san francisco bay these days as for mccovey well they kept telling me for twenty years that ted williams took a very casual attitude toward fly balls too but nobody even felt moved to draw any generalities about tall lefthanded hitters from san diego but whatever limitations mccovey may have when he is not swinging at a fast ball are certainly not the limitations of a teammate named willie mays as dark would be the first to attest mays is a flaming genius in the outfield he catches everything he cuts off balls between outfielders he makes the right throw to the right base he is in the starting lineup day after day until he quite literally drops from exhaustion we all know how that story reads by now mays collapses into a dead faint and the giants lose two or three games before he gets back into the lineup one might even say that willie is the symbol of the team man in baseball just as jackie robinson was the symbol of the competitor you can tell me latinamerican players are lazy and i will listen to you politely but please do not tell me that minnie minoso whom i first signed out of cuba in was lazy minnie would be in there hustling for games a year he might be carrying ten pounds of tape around his body but hed still be giving you his standard percent because minnie was one of the greatest competitors i have ever seen if we want to talk about team spirit we can talk about maury wills leading the dodgers to the pennant although he was sliding on legs that were raw and bloody if we want to compare iqs we can talk about bill white of the cardinals who made himself into a topflight player through intelligence and application i can remember a game when my dear friend larry doby tried to steal home against the yankees in a ridiculous situation and i stated publicly that it was a stupid play because it was but that didnt make him stupid because hes not i just wanted to know what had got into him you can understand why stupid people do stupid things it is always difficult to understand why a bright man does a stupid thing in other words if we started to list the exceptions to the overall indictment we just might end up with a list containing more names than the nonexceptionswhich would put the exceptions in the majority and make the nonexceptions the exceptions and aw lets forget about it the point im trying to make here quite obviously is that individuals are bright and dumb selfish and selfsacrificing good and bad races are just a collection of individuals i suppose that the negro will know he has come to full equality when he is granted the glorious right to take all the credit for his triumphs and all responsibility for his failings i do not expect it to happen tomorrow morning a home run is without color nationality or previous condition of servitude and so is a bonehead play it may not be completely irrelevant that the terms bonehead play and rockhead were a part of the language of baseball while the color line still stood pure and inviolable if we check the record books we may even discover that they were applied to players who were light of hue and backed to the hilt by generations of good anglosaxon forebears the difference of course is that nobody has ever said there goes that dumb white soandso again this does not mean that im copping out on the subject by delivering the usual profound and resounding liberal manifestos which are really meant to prove that i am pure of heart i think the indictment whether dark made it or not has enough merit in enough cases to be worthy of much closer examination we need more than anything else to be less selfconscious about race it has become so difficult to discuss this subject on its merits because you are a loser no matter which way you go it is an accepted part of one branch of american folklore that the negro is almost a different speciesand not a higher one these people are willing to concede that the negro is superior physically because he is inferior mentally a somewhat dubious compliment to the other side it is holy writ couched though it may be in vague scientific terms that there is absolutely no difference between any people anywhere and that anyone who thinks there is or might be is a dirty bigot who should be stoned out of the communitypresumably toward the end of keeping that spirit of scientific inquiry alive at the risk of being stoned i want to stand up boldly and say that there is a difference between black and white black is darker white is lighter if we cant agree on that were in real trouble there are physical differences between races too when i was in japan last year to telecast the japanese allstar game the one thing that impressed me above everything else was the weakness of japanese throwing arms even though their ball parks are somewhat smaller than ours no outfielder is expected to make a throw directly to a base a cutoff man goes out automatically to relay all throws the way it was explained to me the japanese shoulder is so constructedon a downward slopethat it is almost impossible for them to throw a ball that will rise as soon as a boy gives any indication of having a strong arm he is pressed into service as a pitcher and here as it was explained to me is the most interesting part of all almost all pitchers i was told are the fruit of a mixed marriage with an inhabitant of one of the offshore islands it is an infusion of blood in other words that changes the construction of the shoulder w but that isnt too surprising either who among us hasnt observed that the mixture of oriental and white blood produces women whose beauty takes the breath away i believe it is known among the more learned academicians in mississippi as mongrelization the american negro has a physical difference too he can run faster and jump higher question asked with an appropriate sneer what authority do you cite mr veeck for this flat unequivocal and unscientific statement answer the greatest authority i know the authority of my own observations which means far more to me than anything out of an anthropologists tract i know that negroes can run faster because i have observed them running faster on baseball and football fields i have observed that when the six finalists in any dash event of any national track meet to say nothing of conference championships crouch over the starting line a minimum of five of them will be negroes usually it is all six my eyes also tell me that negroes jump higher because i can see that almost all the best high jumpers are negroes and so are almost all the best rebounders in the national basketball association to say nothing of any college campus i am able to cite one other authority to support me you almost all sports fans and certainly all athletes accept the fact that negroes run faster and jump higher give me all the theories you can find about sociological and economic forcesand i will give you a few backbut lets not permit anybody to bull us into saying that we dont know what we are seeing there are sociological economic and psychological factors that push the negro into sports sure that can hardly be the entire story though because i am sure there are plenty of towhaired farm boys from nebraska who want to win the meter olympic dash just as badly and practice as hard as any negro boy they just get shut out in the quarterfinals thats all after all records are falling in all track events these days and white runners are setting their share of the new ones the same sociologic and economic pressures would surely apply to all events it is only in all the dashes and the high jump that the negro has his monopoly in point of fact there is a physical basis to account for their superiority as dashmen and jumpers the negro has a somewhat different bone formation in his ankle which gives him an extra cushion off which to spring basketball is a game which seems to have been practically invented for the negro it is a game of particularly sharp reflex of sudden spurts and quick stops of jumping and of timing it is therefore logically enough a game which is becoming increasingly dominated by negroes the nba has already reached the stage where the operators for reasons having to do with nothing more than customer identification are willing to take a and man who are white over negroes who have slightly more ability you will notice that i slipped in the words sharp reflex and i can already hear the snickering out there that goes yeah and they all have rhythm too huh the implication being that anyone who dares to say that negroes have a more basic sense of rhythm is giving him the benefit of the doubt stupid giving myself the benefit of the doubt i dont think im so stupid the national league is superior to the american league these days becauseand no one even bothers to argue this anymore except a few chronic searchers after lost causesbecause the national league stocked up on negro players while the american league was sitting back and admiring how nicely the yankees were getting along without them in the national league had fifteen hitters twelve of them were colored the year before the national league had eleven hitters ten of them were colored it would seem fairly clear then that negroes are better hitters than whites no not more deprived not better motivated we re not talking about that better hitters hitting is reflex and timing in short rhythm it is always possible that there are physicalmeaning biological factors involved that go far beyond our knowledge in the first place what is a negro we have a way in this country of arbitrarily characterizing anybody with any negro blood in him as negro it would seem to me that anybody with one negro grandparent is three quarters white and that my side is entitled to take credit for percent of him remembering what the infusion of island blood does for the japanese throwing arm and sighing over those bea itiful eurasian women i have to wonder whether anybody has really conducted meaningful and objective experiments on the relationship of the percentage of negro blood to athletic ability wouldnt it be funny if they really owed it all to us the real question is why there should be any question of the negros superiority in these directions at all the answer i suppose is that both races seem to be more comfortable ignoring it the white man doesnt like to think that the negro is superior in a basic test of strength and skill the negro knows that to be superior is to be different and he has learned that differences have a way of being used against him still i have a sneaking suspicion that when negroes gather together in the privacy of their own parlors they are quite willing to boast about their physical superiority over their little white brothers as for the economic and sociological factors they are so apparent that they are almost not worth going into the american negro is not as far removed from the purely physical life as the white man he is after all only years removed from the harsh life of slavery he still finds himself on the whole limited to harsh physical work next time you see a crew of movers you will notice that the white men have assigned themselves the arduous task of telling the negro how to carry a piano on his back this is known as integration italics editors having been denied the fruits of our soft society the negro has been denied the luxury of growing soft in the bone and muscle negro athletes even last much longer than white athletes which can only mean that the point of physical deterioration comes much earlier even in the best trained white athlete the economic problem is simple the performing artssports and entertainmenthave attracted a disproportionate share of the negro population because they have provided the only fields to which the negro has had free entree it could almost be said that if a negro has it in him to be an athlete he has to give it a try and because he knows there is a stone wall waiting for him to butt his head against in the event he doesnt make it he will throw all his energy into developing his talents now that seems to fly in the face of our original theme doesnt it if the negro can run faster react quicker and is in addition more highly motivated how can it also be said that he is lacking in team pride and spirit an entirely different set of circumstances comes into play here we are speaking of these players after they have made it and remember we are still talking about a minority of a minority we are moving into the area of human relations now because we are involved with the relationship between black and white in the united states more particularly we are dealing with the hidden emotional dialogue that passes back and forth between them below the surface behind the spoken word at the root of the difficulty is the white mans beliefwhy is this so difficult to shakethat the negro should be grateful for being allowed to play in the big leagues the same quality that the fans most admired in eddie stanky his combativeness was the very quality they criticized in jackie robinson it was as if they were saying whats the matter doesnt he appreciate the chance were giving himwhich could only mean that they did not really believe he was as entitled to that chance as the kid next door by the same token i suspect that managers and players will criticize a colored player who seems to be lackadaisical far more than they would criticize a white teammate when a colored player loafs he is showing they feel that he does not appreciate what has been done for him which againcan only mean that they still consider him at this hidden emotional level to be something less than equal the negro having developed antennae which are perfectly attuned to that wave length picks it up understands and is not gladdened robinson always reacted to criticism by playing harder but people are different other negroes finding this sort of peripheral prejudice existing at the point where they had thought they had escaped from it react by drawing back into themselves it is more than possible you know that the negro in the ghetto never feels rejected with quite the intensity of the negro who becomes a celebrity in the great unghettoized worldas a bigleague ballplayer let us sayand then finds that all the success in the world does not make him immune from the same old slights and humiliations even here of course human beings react in a multiplicity of ways to find that nothing you can do can change your situation can be a great comfort to some since it means that no further fighting is necessary to others it is the ultimate rejection it was paul robeson the negro who achieved popular acclaim of his time who became the most disaffected of all negroes the white players are aware if only subconsciously that what is really bugging the negro are the conditions that have been imposed upon him as a negro human nature being what it is their reaction is to turn the situation completely around since his moodiness arises out of the fact of his being a negro then it becomes a simple matter for the white player to tell himself that is the natural result of his being a negro sure he thinks to himself all of them are like that it is far more comforting we can all agree to blame him and his race than to blame us and our race so here we go again it is now the negros turn to react a second time to the white teammates reaction to him if a man is made to feel that he is not accepted as a member of the country the community or the team he will come to feel that he is a member of nothing except the negro race and that he owes allegiance to the negro race only this is not an attitude that is going to leave a man brimming over with team pride the problems of the latin american are somewhat different and probably even more complicated to give you an idea of the problem confronting him do this for me take one of his white teammates away from his home and family put him down in a caribbean village where nobody speaks his language have him eat strange foods which emphasize his foreignness and also upset his stomach have him faced socially in this imaginary village with completely newand bewilderingcustoms which discriminate against him make it perfectly clear to him that he is not considered quite the equal of the natives and that while no offense is intended it would be greatly appreciated if he would be a good fellow and keep his distance he just might feel that he is an outsider he just might not have any flaming loyalty to his team he might even have trouble remembering what his teams name is when he does manage to find the ball park the manager has to pass on all instructions to him in this strange language necessitating a certain amount of sign language and a certain tone of voice that reminds him uncomfortably of the tone that is used toward a particularly backward child it is just possible that he might be uncertain and hesitant and being uncertain and hesitant he might not go about his work with his accustomed snap and vigor he might not even want to if you treat a man like a migratory worker he will act like a migratory worker this is the situation admittedly carried to its extreme that the latinamerican players have been confronted with as they begin to come up to the big leagues in greater number they naturally tend to group together in the clubhouse as well as off the field much in the way american players would group together in puerto rico much in fact as americans have traditionally grouped together within their own cities clubhouse cliques have always been a part of the baseball scene but this is something new this clique speaks in a foreign tongue this is a foreign colony setting itself up in the last american stronghold the baseball clubhouse you see them there chattering away in spanish and every once in a while you are left with the uneasy feeling that these foreigners are talking about you and laughing at you if they want to play here and take home our money you think to yourself why dont they speak english like everybody else if you are half intelligent you dont carry that kind of thinking too far and yet some of the resentment remains enough of it remains at any rate so that when you can find an outlet by criticizing them for something that is obviously true an easier attitude toward their work you are not slow to seize upon it they dont hustle they dont care theyre taking the bread out of my childrens mouths never mind that they are also leading the team in hitting that only makes it worse that only shows how good they could be if they cared there is some truth here too the latin temperament is quite different than the american temperament people who grow up in latinamerican countriesbe they white or coloredhave never been noted for their energy there is first of all that enervating tropical climate which slows down the entire pace of life we dont see ourselves as others see us we dont even begin to appreciate that our whole attitude toward life has been formed by that remarkable institution the american dream which tells us that there is nothing we cannot do nothing we cannot be if we will educate ourselves work hard and think clean thoughts we are a nation of optimists the american player whom we call a hustler is just the standard american gogetter transported to the baseball field we are also a people who think in terms of the longrun because we have been granted the luxury of a stable government we are so sure that the framework that exists today will be there always that it does not even enter our calculations the latin american has no such history of political stability his thinking formed just as unconsciously by his own background is for the shortrun the latinamerican player wants to be successful sure but he does not really think in terms of being a big success the drive to keep pushing himself to rise higher and higher just hasnt been built into the marrow of his bones he is more apt to wonder why these crazy americans dont relax and take a siesta now and then instead of rushing around all the time going nowhere the criticism of the latinamerican player really adds up to the ageold cry theyre not like us and they are not the difference in temperament could hardly be wider in all of these differences and all of these conflicts as they apply to both the negro and the latin american there is one constant they have not a thing to do with basic intelligence there are some people who fear that the negro will soon dominate the major leagues i take this as a compliment to baseball because it shows that everyone understands that ball clubs will play the best men available in every position regardless of colorand regardless of any talk about conflicts of temperament i for one dont think its going to happen i think that as other fields open up for the negro a drainingotf process will set in besides as the negro becomes more sophisticated more successful more middleclass he will become less physical he will sit at an office desk drive to the corner for his newspaper and be privileged to enjoy the rich food we could all do so nicely without the debilitating process will have begun welcome to the affluent society a report black arts convention by dudley randall he first black arts convention sponsored by forum met in detroit june at central united church of christ it went beyond the arts for in addition to randall workshops on literature music art and the drama there were workshops on education religion negro history and politics an estimated persons attended the threeday sessions coming from most of the major cities across the nation stokely carmichael new executive director of sncc was injured in a demonstration and was unable to give the opening address charles p howard took his place and read a message from carmichael which expressed the hope that when one black man gets hurt every black man will move against those who hurt him howard said that the u s propaganda in africa against leaders like nasser sukarno and toure is fantastic he urged negroes to support and sacrifice for our militant leaders we must have nkrumah back he said max stanford said the black male has no power is a faggot the black man can only become a man through a revolution by any means possible he cited atrocities against negroes there should be a program for group action negroes must unite and organize the panel on literature stressed that the black writer should not write for the approval of a white audience but to the needs and aspirations of his people lawrence p neal said this will not be limiting for the range of black experience was broader than the range of western experience and included love wonder excitement rhobena nelson urged that writers know their own history and oliver lagrone and bobb hamilton said they must teach the beauty of blackness harold foster said that writers must open the eyes of the people to the ugliness around them and spur them to action dudley randall said that the seeming disadvantages of black writers were in reality opportunities because since they had less chance of being corrupted or distracted by success they could devote themselves to the solitary labor of writing they should develop their own media and publishing houses in the panel on religion the view was expressed that god is not dead but only old notions of god and of the singleness of god one member said negroes dont need whiteys theology and ridiculed the stories of the creation and of jesuss birth a speaker from the floor called christianity the most damaging of all religions it broke the people fitted them to be slaves milton henry said we cannot throw out the scriptures especially the old testament even though paul had perverted them with his admonition slaves be obedient to your masters in the workshop on negritude and afroamerican history harold lawrence outlined the contributions of negroes like isaiah mccoy to american technology martha prescott said that history is a tool of culture we can use it not only to set the record straight but to understand the process of deculturization that took place years ago k william kgositsile a south african said it doesnt matter how much black history you know if you dont use it senegal is still a french colony confrontation of africa with the west is inevitable what will the black artist do to orientate the black psyche it is a question of survival he said leopold senghor initiated negritude because he realized no matter how french the senegalese were to the french the were still niggers the motels hotels and banks are still french the negroes there are like niggers on plantations jackie wilson a member of forum read a paper on black nationalism that said black essence is still to be born he proposed an institute for africanamerican studies here or in harlem to know this beast and fight him in the halls of the university of chicago harvard and the university of california in the drama panel david rambeau gave a short history of detroits concept east theater he said they had been not talking but doing at concept east the black actor can learn the elements of acting without the humiliation of being patronized by whites denise nicholas said one of the biggest problems of the free southern theater is material blacks have been writing plays but few have been produced there are few black actors and technicians another problem is the lack of images and symbols for black people most plays deal with one or two whites and the natives except for a few plays by leroi jones and one or two others sylvia king spoke of the need for black writers and producers we need people to invest their money in productions she was baf fled by whether to play negro roles or roles of just any mother wife i doctor or lawyer lawrence p neal asked who we were trying to reach what do we want to say mrs kings individual problems are not important shakespeare the russian and the french dramatists knew they were writing for englishmen russians frenchmen negroes alone have to ask themselves whom they are writing for he criticized rambeau for i producing waiting for godot a play which has nothing at all to do with black people it doesnt matter that youve been not talking but doing it matters what youre doing we need not just a theater of anger and protest but of love spirituality there are plays in the schomburg collection by afroamericans which are out of print and available for production rambeau replied that all have their humanity no one can give it or take it away when you talk about whitey you have lost your humanity when you get into talk about aesthetics you dont get action people starve not from whitey but because you have talked them to death concept east has done the toilet the slave dutchman blues for mr charlie and plays by local authors neal replied that rambeau still hadnt answered why he produced godot he asked who controls concept east who pays costs who selects roles because our people have been lulled into a zombielike state of complacency we need the spectrum of emotions including hate mentioning whitey doesnt lessen humanity we can have a dialogue as brothers and sisters an elderly man in the audience said we dont hate white people we hate hate weve been beat robbed killed in this country and were going to love it if thats love damn it denise nicholas wanted some way to pool resources so ideas could spread across the country neal suggested that concept east the three new york theaters and other theaters form a national black theater and meet on pooling resources in the workshop on politics grace boggs suggested that citizens organize on small grievances until they could take power a member of the black citizens council of watts made the only derogatory remark about malcolm_x when he said there were three kinds of black nationaliststhe talking kind and he showed a picture of malcolm eloquent and logical but doing nothing the ram kind who are suspicious of everybody and the action kind and he showed a picture of a watts youth saying burn baby burn another speaker said that where the blacks live they should have control leaders should take orders from the black community the party could have any name but should have black officers and be controlled by the black community the prime minister of the harlem peoples parliament in new york said it was the goal of a nation to establish a government therefore they had chosen the yoruba culture and had established a government in harlem he had appointed ministers in fields of their interest and accomplishment the minister of education has set up a curriculum from grade to grade if this curriculum is not started in the schools in september they will padlock the schools on liberation day may they will stop paying rent women will take over the lofts and start light industries sunday novelist john oliver killens delivered the closing address in which he said that the negro was an anglosaxon invention to make black men undeserving of human treatment to deniggerize to rid the world of niggers is the job of the black revolution in this struggle minds are enslaved with words and words must free our minds killens said in this struggle love is irrelevant a master cant love his slave and a slave cant love his master unless he is a fool we must know the profound beauty of broad noses thick lips we must create our own myths our own legends we must consolidate our power in cities and take power places where negroes live dont have to be ghettos we must stop wasting too much ammunition on each other the convention as a whole had the fervency of a religious revival there were the icons of the saints marcus garvey w e b du bois paul robeson malcolm_x there were the shouts of amen tell it brother and applause and standing ovations for malcolm_xs widow and poetry reader val gray the artists musicians and writers were there but conspicuous by their absence were the local leaders except those of the freedom now party yet underneath the fervency there was a certain wistfulness these desires to control their own destiny to produce their own art to defend themselves from attack which kept the local bigwigs away in droves are after all nothing alarming nothing radical these are rights which should be taken for granted without even having to be talked about these plans for political power are the same as those discussed by the republican and the prohibition parties or by jews italians or poles all through the ages all over the world it has been mans right to defend his life and person what made the wistfulness is that it was necessary to have such a convention at all the wall by gloria davis lba stood before his father waiting for his answer and clenching his fists hopefully his father bit his full top lip and turned his eyes away avoiding him alba could feel the wall rising between them the wall which always seemed to rise from nowhere suddenly he wanted to cry out but the memory that he was no longer a small boy stopped his tears the dirt which made the floor felt sticky under his bare feet he dropped his hands and walked through the huge hole which made a door onto the rocky pathway the morning air stuck in his nostrils and the cool earth soothed the soles of his hot feet he walked past the rundown shacks until he found a deserted spot he took a deep breath and looked around suddenly he thought about nee her silky skin and flashing smile her thick full lips and broad nose everyone said she was beautiful he had only recently met her but already he had decided that she would be his wife many other boys of the village had wanted her but he had gotten her his chest swelled with pride at the thought nee was not the only reason he wanted to go to the south to work in the mines he wanted nice things and there was no work here that could pay for them he wanted a fine house like he saw in the magazines he wanted rugs so deep that his feet could get lost in them and beautiful furniture he wanted to work a full year before getting married then he would be seventeen he had known that he needed money to go south but he thought it would prove to be no problem he had told his father of his plans fine good he had said nee will make a good wife and give you many sons he had said fine to everything until he heard about the mines how come you cant stay here and work he had yelled mf j ml m alba had explained the reason to him over and over finally he had given up and left his father to turn the idea over in his head again hoping he would change his mind he had asked two more times but had gotten no reply he couldnt understand it his father had once lived in the south he turned and started home where you been boy his father demanded out he replied you mad at me yeah how come how come you wont gimme no money to go south alba spat how come you dont want me to work in the mines he added yelling alba looked at his father he saw his eyes waver and the wall rise between them again sit and eat the food it is hot now his father said pointing to the table alba pulled a box across the earthmade floor he picked up a chipped dish and dipped stew from the black pot they were eating in silence until his papa said aint you changed your mind yet boy naw alba replied maybe you should talk to nee maybe she could help you change your mind no why not because i am a man and a man needs no woman to help him make important decisions you once told me that it is important for a man to make the decisions why are you changing now im not changing you have yet to become a man you are a small boy with boyish dreams you are a boy who needs help to make important decisions i am a man i have the dreams of a man i do not want to wither and die old like you with nothing alba gestured excitedly eating the same food day in and day out from chipped bowls and black pots he was immediately sorry for the way he had spoken he could see that his father had been hurt by the way his face crumbled if you were a man i would hit you but you are yet a child and you do not know the real treasures of life like a child you let your tongue wag loosely and your words spill freely the old man slowly rose from the table and walked away alba sat at the table and thought about what his father had said still he denied that he was a child and that his words spilled freely and his tongue wagged loosely he knew that he would never get the money from his father he had torn at the wall which stood before him with strong urgent hands he had beat it with forceful fists and kicked it with hot sweating feet but it had not budged it still stood immovable laughing at him for he could never tear it down to see what lay behind it he knew what he would do he would have to work secretly to get the money if he could just work tomorrow he would have almost enough and he could get the rest from nee this would be adequate to get him there he would worry about the rest when the time came with his plan in his mind he moved the chipped bowls off the table and washed them alba strolled out into the next mornings air to look for a job he went from place to place looking hungrily for work finally a man hired him the job paid less than he had hoped but he took it anyway he arose each morning after to go to work returned late in the day and had dinner from the cracked bowls with his father he had made up his mind he now planned on a day of leaving before he left he would go by nees as he did many evenings now but he would say goodbye e in the middle of dinner that evening his father rose and left the table in a minute he came back and thrust the money on the table howd you get that money steal it alba felt guilty only for a moment naw i worked for it why i needed it so i could go south he saw a shadow creep into his fathers eyes and the wall was between them again but this time the shadow began to fade and the wall began to crumble you say you do not want to wither and die old like me with nothing if you go to the mines you will grow old and die with not even this he waved his hands futilely you will work hard and soon spit blood it is a slow dying you will do boy what of your family will they be like mine my papa worked in the mines too and he soon coughed blood and died he left his sons and wife alone to work he did not have even this he gestured again is it not better to live and have nothing than to work and die with nothing the unanswered question hung in the air the money lay on the table alba went to nees my father my bottom my fleas by ethridge knight kentucky summer y t ip y was hot and the levee cut off what little breeze there was the river was down the bottom was closing in on me although i had been feeling him out for a long time i dont think i i i would have ever gotten up enough courage to do it if it had not been for the busted lip bring it out in the opentonight i told myself as i stood in the bathroom silently pressing a cold cloth to my mouth it didnt matter that i had had my mouth busted by him maybe a hundred times before or that i knew such accidents were unavoidable while body punchingespecially when our bodies were slick with sweat and we were caught up in the heat of battle before supper he had come out alongside the backyard fence where i was digging baitworm beginning the ritual he had stripped off his shirt and said wanna go a coupla rounds sport i had dropped my spade and completed the ceremonyas i had done for as long as i can remember yessir a coupla rounds if you want to i stripped off my shirt and we squared off during the workout he got carried away and one of his punches had glanced off my shoulder splitting my lip ignoring his are you hurt sport huh are you hurt i had shaken off the gloves and struck out for the bathroom spitting out blood along the way for awhile he had hung around outside the bathroom door sucking air through his teeth well i would also use his regret to help press my case tonight after supper for a half hour he hunched over my shoulder while i did his weekly bookkeeping in the livingroom it was friday payday and i figured out the hours he had worked the grocery bill the house rent and everything with his overtime and all things were not so bad he slapped me on the back then turned and went in the kitchen where mama and tina my tenyearold sister were doing the dishes he got himself a can of beer and came back in the livingroom easing into his chair by the radio i waited until he had finished listening to gabriel heatter and the news then i walked up to him took a deep breath and plunged in daddy yeah sport daddy clovis perkins and frank hughes and oliver cobb and fred polk and everybody are going down to take their army physicals monday morning i couldnt see his face because he leaned over the radio and began twisting the dial i took a step closer and continued ill probably be sent close byto fort knox maybe and ill be able to come home sometimes on weekends and since ill be seventeen soon anyway you really wouldnt be lying if you signed the papers and the recruiting officer said he snapped the radio off and faced me leaning forward he dropped his chin on his chest and stared up at me from under his lumpy scartissued eyebrows i saw two deep furrows cut across his jetblack brow and i got a little nervous then he began slowly weaving his head from side to side as if he were slipping punches and said what you bob talking bout sport sign what weave papers you aint seventeen bob like them others you weave sixteen whered you get this foolishness from you aint going to no bob army this fall you going back to weave school he glared at me for a second then turned back to the radio fingering the dial even though i had expected that bobbingandweaving bit i couldnt help hesitating id seen that same trick send bill collectors scurrying when he was out of work and didnt have money to pay his debts it had worked on tina and me often when wed try to wheedle a buck out of him for a movie or something id seen it work on mama even like when shed jump on him for sitting in the front yard in his undershirt shed usually wind up massaging his shoulders or something but there have been times the trick didnt work like the time mrs woodson a big woman with big big breast who was tinas music teacher came one night to our house and told him that he was going to have to buy a piano for tina that really hit him he shuffled around the living room snorting and shadowboxing like he was in madison square garden the battle raged for hours but he couldnt hold out against the barrage of tears pleas and cutting words loosed by mama mrs woodson and tina i even took their side and got in a few good licks before he finally said okay okay ill see about getting the damn thing tomorrow so i wasnt about to let that bobbing and weaving trick work on me now i folded my arms across my chest and said look daddy i might as well go now in a year or so ill have to go anyway i mean the war might last til fortyeight or fortyninesome people say so why wait you gotta stay in school sport wait a little while besides he said softly whos gonna do my figuring for me if you leave that caught me below the belt i turned and walked over to the sofa and flopped on it collecting my composure i knew that he was very proud of and slightly amazed by my ability with numbers many times i remembered in the evenings hed be sitting in the front yard with mr murray one of his old boxing buddies and hed call me out and have me trying to explain algebra and geometry to them i had a notion to ask him whod done his bookkeeping before id learned how but i didnt i decided to compromise well look daddy suppose i dont go to the army suppose i just go off somewhere and get a job at least for the rest of the summer and ill be back home in time for school just when i thought i had him seeing things my way he suddenly changed styles on me he shifted to mama who with tina had slipped against the wall listening to the whole thing whats the matter with this damn fool boy he said to her he gone crazy you better talk to him i felt cheated and fouled whats she got to do with it i shouted jumping up from the sofa this is between you and me whats so crazy about it anyway you yourself have told me a thousand times that you left home dur mg the first world war and you were only fifteen thats different things was different then they better now he shoved up from his chair strode across the room and began his bobbing and weaving bit again you aint going bob nowheres get it out of your weave head tomorrow im going downtown to that recruiting office and tell the man bob myself i faced him squarely i dont pare what you do im getting out of this stupid place i saw the vein swelling and wiggling like a fishing worm in his temple and i knew that i should shut up but the words popped out of my mouth im not going to stay in this stupid old town and become a stupid old man i saw the blur his open palm whipped up smacking against my ear i leaped backwards and fell into a crouch with my guard up he took a step toward me his eyes were flaming slits his left hand hung at his side and his right hand was raised above his head he was wide open then i saw his hand swooping down and my mind screamed catchit with your left and countercounter throw your rightyour right but i couldnt move a muscle my chest hurt my ears roared tears welled in my eyes again his hand lifted from far away i heard mama moan and tina whimper and i moved i slipped under his swing and scooted for the door there i paused fighting down the hurlyburly in my brain and threw what i figured was my toughest look in his direction i think i saw him wipe his eyes with the back of his hand but im not sure i crawled into bed and pulled the covers over my head with my ears ringing with the image of his slitted eyes and uplifted hand dancing behind my eyelids and with the desire to clear out bubbling through my blood i twisted and fretted for hours the next morning the taste of the fight was still in my mouth and the whirlwind was still in my head for a moment i lay on the twisted sheets soaking in the morning sounds trying to locate daddy in the living room tina was tinkling on the piano from the basement came the slushlunkaslushlunka of mamas washing machine outside a big semitrailer growled down highway past the back of our house where they coughed and grinded gears for the long pull up and over the ohio river bridge and droned away into illinois not hearing daddys heavy footsteps around the house i guessed that he had gone downtown to pay the saturday billsand to see the recruiting officer groaning inwardly i rolled out of bed washed and dressed i examined my busted lip in the mirror and my chest tightened i wheeled and went into the kitchen where i sat down at the table picked up a cold sweet potato peeled it and bit viciously into the soft yellow meat i heard mama moving around in the basement and i glanced at the basement door in my mind i could see her shoving clothes through the wringer her eyes large and luminous her skin smooth like chocolate with tiny buds of perspiration glistening on the tip of her nose and curling the edges of her hair i half rose to go to her then i sat back down thinking of another time when she had looked at me funnylike and said but sport try to understand hes my man she had aired my mattress that particular day and had found under it certain cheaply printed highly illustrative pamphlets and some peacock prophylactics and when i had come from school the pamphlets and prophylactics were laid neatly wrapped in brown paper in the center of my bed at supper i couldnt meet her eyes but all evening i swaggered around the house prepared for and welcoming an outburst from daddy the outburst never came and when it became obvious that she hadnt told him i felt strangely let down later after asking her why she hadnt told him and after her answering hes my man i felt ashamed and angry i finished eating the sweet potato and stood up looking at the basement door she would be thinking about last night i was ashamed she would think i wanted her to intercede i was angry i picked up another sweet potato and slipped out the back door heading for the river and mr frank clayton paige i climbed the grasscovered levee which separated the river from the bottom the neighborhood where i lived the levee was the community park for the bottom it was here on hot summer eveningsin spite of the stinging mosquitosthat the old folks sat the children played and the guys rambled with the girls catching the cool breeze blowing off the river it was here a few nights ago that i had kissed cathy cathy with the chinese eyes and quick smile i had kissed her and kissed her fumbling with her blouse and she had let my hand rest on her small tense breast i shoved my hands in my pockets and stopped thinking about going past cathys house then i spotted mr frank clayton paige tramping out of his shack he squatted beside the river bank and began to haul in his night lines i trotted down the river side of the levee scrambled through the willows and bushes and in a couple of minutes i was squatting beside mr frank clayton paige he looked over at me and nodded half smiling i nodded back and dragged his doughbucket in front of me keeping quiet i began to roll the soft lumpy dough into smooth balls of doughbait it was hard to tell about mr frank clayton paige sometimes he didnt like to talk early in the morning mr frank clayton paige was a white man with thick hair brown like cured tobacco leaves in the summer it turned reddish like the streaks in the river when the sun went down he was tall almost as tall as daddy but not nearly as thick and he had funny eyes that changed colors like the river did some of the bottom folks said that mr frank clayton paige was rich and that he had lost his wife and children in the flood of but all i know for sure about him is that after the flood he showed up one day built himself a tarpaper shack on the river bank threw out his lines and commenced to fish he never talked about himself and i for one never asked him the old folks avoided him somewhat but clovis perkins oliver cobb fred polk and i hung around his shack all the time even if he didnt talk much he would always listen to us guys listen with a tiny shine way back in his eyes funny ive seen him look at the river the very same way mr frank clayton paige unhooked the few shimmering fish then he said aint you going to your car wash job today sport uhuh i quit i began to rebait the hooks letting the cold wet lines slide across my palm mr frank clayton paige didnt remark he walked a piece down the bank and threw a line hissing out over the water i called down to him you know clovis perkins and oliver cobb and everybody are going to the army monday dont you yeah they told me i got to my feet and blurted out well i asked daddy to sign some papers so i could go too and he wouldnt do it and we had a fight and so im gonna leave im going somewhere mr frank clayton paige looked at me and grunted and i felt foolish after a bit he said where you figuring on going i dont know yetmaybe new orleans maybe chicago got any money sixteen dollars umm aint too much what with the war prices and all nossir but ill make outill make out well he said dismissing the conversation with a shrug lets have a slug of coffee once more i felt foolish and a little disappointed i followed mr frank clayton paige to his shack resolving not to bring the subject up again i drank the coffee silently and afterward with two fishing poles in my hands i walked back to the river the sun was high by now throwing sparkles in the water and spreading a warm blanket everywhere i set out my fishing poles and lazed about on the soft grass gazing up at the patches of cotton floating in the washed blue sky flies and snakedoctors buzzed and flitted around i drowsed a barge carrying scrapiron glided by sending waves laplapping against the bank i slept when i woke the afternoon was deep and i was hungry the sun had fallen behind the bridge which stood humped like the skeleton of a giant dinosaur some of the bottom folks through with their days work were strung out along the bank the mosquitoes and crickets had started their racket and bullbats were darting through the air snapping up gnats i lifted my hooks which had been nibbled clean out of the water and looked around for mr frank clayton paige he was fishing away from the bottom folks on a sandy knoll that jutted out into the river i stood for a moment looking at him then casting off my resolution i leaned the fishing poles against his shack and went over he looked up with that funny shine in his eyes well mr frank clayton paige i said i dont guess ill be seeing you anymore he stuck out his hand gimme a lift i grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet still set on going huh sport he said i nodded yes come on down to the place for a minute he wheeled toward his shack and somewhat reluctantly i followed inside the dim fishy shack mr frank clayton paige rummaged through some cardboard boxes then he straightened up and turned holding in his hand a long wallet like the kind semitrailer drivers carry understand me clear sport he said i think youre wrong in leaving home i think you had better listen to your daddy but every dogs gotta scratch his own fleas he stuck his hand in the wallet and counted out some bills here take thisin case you might want to come back to your daddy and to your river though i was surprised i didnt argue i took the money and stood like an idiot counting it one hundred dollars mr frank clayton its okay sport just remember wherever you go to scratch your own fleas i opened my mouth to say something again but he made a shooing motion with his hand his eyes were shining in the dimness and he turned back to the cardboard boxes i threw up my hand at him stepped out of the shack and headed for the levee smiling i had no worries now with a hundred bucks i could go to the north pole i need not even go home for my few clothes i would simply follow the levee on around to town board a bus and be on my way topping the levee i stopped for one final look at the bottom i inspected it i gazed at it with my eyes i devoured it turning it upside down and inside out it rested twisted and listless like a fat snake squeezed between the levee on this side and highway on the other the frame houses mostly unpainted faced the levee as if they were snubbing the highway and the town beyond black stove pipes jutting crookedly out of the patched tin roofs oozed wisps of smoke from the supper fires and the smoke hovering in the still air formed a haze that was tinted copper by the now dead sun young ones played quietly in the packed dirt yards waiting to be called in to supper but every now and then one of them would send a shriek slicing through the air i could see aunt mandy who used to tell me ghost stories sitting on her front steps over there was clovis perkins leaning his bike against the fence and there was mr buchanan turning off the highway in his old chevy i tried to spot cathy maybe prancing out to pump some water yonder was florence with her baby poochie whose daddyeverybody said was a white man i tried not to look at our house but when i saw tina shoot out from behind some houses racing toward mrs jacksons i couldnt help but look i didnt see him sitting in the front yard probably hulked in the living room with his ear glued to the radio probably waiting for his coupla rounds sport no sir not tonight sir thank you sir not ever again i rose to go beyond the bottom saw the towns lights glowing in the dusk and i fancied that i could see the blue dog flashing on and off above the bus station then i saw tina again she dashed out of mrs jacksons house and flew down the dusty street she disappeared behind some more houses then reappeared a few minutes later at aunt mandys gate shouting something aunt mandy got up and hurried out the gate toward our house with tina pulling at her hand i saw mama come out on the porch and look toward aunt mandys i turned and took off for town no sir not tonight sir so what if mrs jackson did own one of the three telephones in the bottom and aunt mandy comes to our house

emergencies hes never been sick in his life he stays in shape not an ounce of fat on him wanna go a coupla rounds sport whos gonna do my figuring i stopped and looked back at our house i could see figures bustling through the rooms but not his big frame all at once i started trotting veering down the bottom side of the levee no sir thank you sir not tonight sir you got to scratch your own fleas sir and i got to scratch my from way across the bottom i heard a siren and i felt like upchucking no sir thank you sir not tonight sir when i hit level ground i broke into a dead run heading for home cotton alley by pearl crayton alley aint the x r right kind of name for a stretch where folk live a person hates to tell anybody his address is on a street with that name it just sounds too common most folk who hear the word alley think of something cheap and nobody wants folk to think he lives in a cheap place even if he does a persons got to have some pride somewhere about him but its hard to have any living in a place called cotton alley thats the way we were all of us who lived on cotton alleya bunch of black folk living in a quarter of dingy little shotgun houses far enough away from the better part of town some trying hard to have a little pride and too many not trying at all mister sam was one of those who didnt try and when he did take a notion to he paid a big price for it cotton alley and what we who lived there were to the rest of the world and one policeman got all tangled up together one saturday evening and did something bad to mister samhurt him real bad but hes out of it now it hurt me too and its still hurting me things are better for my people now were free to go anywhere we want to go and do any kind of work were smart enough to do so its best to forget about all the troubles weve been through and work together to do something for our country like president kennedy said we should do anybody with a dimes worth of sense can see that this is the best thing to do aint nobody got any business going around crying about something that happened twentynine years ago yet every now and then that old nightmare memory from those days before the war rise up in my mind and i cry there just aint no sense in me troubling my mind about what happened to mister sam i want to forget lord knows ive tried to forget but i cant mister sam wasnt any kin to me and i didnt care a cent about him he just wasnt the kind of man folk take a liking to every saturday after he got his paycheck hed stop by the honkytonk and drink too much wine then hed come home and fight miss peewee his commonlaw wife and their little girl lucy mae would stand on their porch and cry sometimes when mister sam got the best of miss peewee shed run off up to mister mose johnsons house and call the police theyd come and take mister sam to jail and call up his bossman whod tell them to turn mister sam aloose and in about an hour hed come home and eat supper he was just another one of the bad things we had to put up with on cotton alley all the churchgoing folk kept away from mister sam on account of his drinking and all the sporting folk kept away from him on account of he worked on the garbage truck and didnt ever smell right besides that he couldnt read or write and some folk claimed he had fits there could have been plenty of folk living on cotton alley who liked mister sam but didnt any of them ever show it while i was around i didnt make pretend i liked him either i got a bigger kick out of poking fun at how bad he smelled then one saturday evening came when he stood up in the yard behind the house where he lived swinging an old halfrotten plank at two policemen panting and hollering ah aint gonna let yall hit me on mah head wit dat blackjack again white folk and his bad smell didnt seem funny to me anymore mister sam looked too much all by himself standing there with nothing but that policemans triggerfinger between him and death but the funny thing was that he didnt look any different to me than he had looked every day that id seen him hed always been that much all by himself i just hadnt paid any attention to it until that evening blood was running from a cut on the side of mister sams head getting mixed up with his sweat every now and then hed wipe that side of his face on his shoulder real quick not slowing down the swing of the plank as he did so that was too hot a day for anybody to be getting all worked up like he was doing the sun was going down but it had been so hot all day that the heat of it was still in the ground and in the wood of the houses and in the old tin cans and bottles and slopjars laying around in the back yard all that heat brought out the smell of everything in that back yard that didnt smell goodthe two old toilets that everybody on the block used but nobody cleaned the sloppy place under the water faucet that always dripped the old rusty zinc tubs of garbage with flies singing over them the wet places around the back doors of the houses where the women threw their dish water the big bunch of folk who were standing around looking at mister sam and the policemen made it seem hotter there were too many of them and they were too quiet everything was too quietwhich made what mister sam and the policemen said sound louder than was natural now you drop that plank boy now you drop that plank right now one policeman was saying in a lazysounding hillbilly drawl holding his pistol on mister sam with one hand and holding out the other hand like he was looking for mister sam to stop swinging the plank and give it to him hed said those same words more times than he had fingers and toes and mister sam was still swinging the plank at him aw mike youre playing with that nigger the other policeman who had come in the black car said come on lets take that plank from this nigger and take him in its getting close to supper time im hungry he was standing off to the side with both hands on his hips looking real sassy his face all frowned up like hed been smelling that back yard too long lucy mae was standing on their back steps crying and calling daddy daddy daddy daddy calling mister sam like she had something to tell him but he didnt pay any attention to her what happened somebody who came up behind me asked in a whisper sam did some sassy talking to them laws n one of em hit im over th head n he runned back here n started acting a fool someone whispered back i wanted to say that aint the way it happened but when i turned my head and saw that it was miss viney whod done the answering i knew better than dispute her word miss viney was the best shouter at our church a loudly professed soldier in the army of the lord who went around fighting sin right and left and she was overaverage good at bringing punishment upon children who sassed grown folk i held back what i wanted to say but holding it made me feel bad inside now when i remember how it was i wish that i had turned around and said to miss viney i saw the whole thing i was standing by mister sams porch when those policemen came to arrest him and i heard every word they said that policeman standing over there with his hands on his hips called mister sam a nigger and mister sam told him don call me no nigger capn cause ah aint no nigger ise a merican man jes like you is thats all he said and that little old sassylooking policeman hit him over the head with his blackjack looking back i dont see how i could have been so scared of a whipping that i wouldnt speak up for mister sam now you listen to me boy im getting tired of fooling around with you the policeman called mike said in a voice that was too lazy to sound mean he didnt act like he was in a great big hurry to take mister sam to jailmaybe because he knew it wouldnt do any good he had come and arrested mister sam plenty of times before and hed always had to come back and do it again in a couple of weeks boy dont you know that old plank you have there aint no match for this here pistol besides theres two of us you cant whip us both by yourself dont you know that now you stop this foolishness and put that plank down he was trying to talk some sense into mister sams head and maybe wait until his arms got tired from swinging that plank ef ah throw way mah pre teckshun yall gonna beat me up wit dem blackjacks capn mister sam said panting like a tired dog but still swinging the plank ef yall promise me yall aint gonna beat me up wit dem blackjacks ahll put dis plank down it seemed like mister sam wanted to put the plank down but he had went and made a big show of standing up for himself in front of all of us so he didnt want to give in without getting the policemen to give in a little too he must have had a notion to try to pretend he had some pride the policeman called mike didnt answer right off like he was making up his mind about what kind of answer to give mister sam right away i crossed my fingers and closed my eyes and started to wish real hard that hed promise like mister sam asked because mister sam was trying to have a little pride for the first time in his life and he should let him have his pride he was ugly and black and he didnt have much sense but he was an american and an american had a right to have some pride but before i got the wish straight in my mind that little old sassy looking policeman was hollering aw no mike no promises we cant make any promises at all no i opened my eyes and saw him waving his hands and shaking his head like he was trying to head off somebody from walking into a wasp nest i took a quick look at the other policemans face and at mister sams face and they both looked letdown they had their eyes on that little sassy looking policeman didnt either of them seem to know what to do next it seemed to me they were looking for him to tell them and that put him in charge a cold and ugly something moved up behind me id been around it enough before to know that it was just old scared creeping up on me i wanted to walk off so i wouldnt see what i was scared i was going to see but i stood there and watched mister sam pay the full price for his pride a feeling inside of me held me there an ugly feeling that had come on me a long long time before way back when i first found out that there was more than one color of folk in the world and i was of the color that didnt fare so well the color that all other colors looked down on i had pushed this feeling to the back of my mind because in church our preacher claimed that god loved black folk j as much as he loved white folk and in school our teacher claimed that everybody born in our country were americans and all americans were equal by our countrys laws so all the while i was in church or school i could keep that feeling in the back of my mind but every time i saw a bus driver make a person my color go sit in the back of the bus or i had to drink water from a fountain marked for my color or i had to sit upthesteps in the picture show where everybody my color had to sit or i passed by city park and saw children other colors playing on ground i couldnt walk on and swinging in swings i couldnt touch or i wanted to go any place folk my color werent allowed to go or i heard somebody call a person my color nigger that old feeling rubbed inside of me it was rubbing me then hurting my belief that what my preacher and teacher said was right hurting me all over if we make a promise to this here nigger all these other niggers standing around here are gonna go all over town bragging about how he got the best of us and after that every time one of us go and try to arrest a nigger hell grab up a stick and make us promise him something aw mike you dont know these niggers you give them an inch and theyll take a mile youve got to handle a nigger like hes a nigger and hell stay in his place now you watch me ill show you how to handle a nigger that little old sassy looking policeman started moving towards mister sam real slowly with both his hands held up as high as his shoulders you see i dont have anything in my hands he said to mister sam im coming take that plank away from you then he looked over his shoulder and said to us standing around you all see i dont have anything in my hands now do i do i have anything in my hands he stood dead still waiting for one of us to answer it was plain that he wanted one of us to agree with him so that wed be on his side against mister sam he had all the rest of the world on his side it didnt make sense for him to want us too us and him and his guns and all the world against mister sam was just too much all my insides wanted to holler out somebody ought to be on mister sams side but my throat was too choked up with being scared for the sound to come out my eyes jumped from one face to the other of the folk standing around in the back yards looking for somebody to say something or do something to help mister sam it seemed to me that while that policeman was standing still waiting for one of us to answer him somebody standing around there could say something to mister sam to get him to throw down that plank and save himself maybe all he needed was for one of us to say something to him but i just didnt know who would do the saying my daddy was standing over by the corner of our house still dressed in the coveralls he worked in at the sawmill it just happened that when my eyes jumped to him he was looking at me and i thought at him with all my heart and soul say something to help mister sam daddy but either he didnt get it or he got it and didnt know what to say or he was scared to say anything because he dropped his head and got all wrapped up in an old tin can that was laying by his foot he kicked it and watched it roll off to the edge of the grass then he kicked what maybe was a rock on the ground maybe it was just the ground he kicked he didnt look at me anymore right then i knew that i needed to be all grown up so that i could say something to make that policeman understand that mister sam was an american man just like hed m told him he was and he had a right to stand up and tell folk to not call him a nigger because he was an american man i needed to be grown up so that i could do something to stop the bad thing i was scared was going to happen so that i could help myself hold on to believing that mister sam and all of us black folk were americans because that was all the pride i had do i have anything in my hands the policeman was asking no suh you shore dont miss vineys voice came from behind me everybody turned and looked at her with the kind of looks that went with cussing but didnt anybody say anything my hands went into fists all by themselves but i knew that i couldnt let them hit her very slowly i made my fingers uncurl holding back being mad hurting my insides holding it back all right nigger im coming to take that plank from you with my bare hands the policeman said moving slowly towards mister sam again you can act a fool and hit me if you want to if youre fool enough to hit a policeman youre the biggest fool in town don come up on me capn mister sam said backing back so scared his eyes were bucked as big as saucers don come up on me ah say the policeman reached out his hand real quick to grab the plank and it hit his hand he jumped clean off the ground and hollered like hed been shot grabbing the hit hand with his other one and shaking them above his head he really clowned for a while he hollered so loud that i could hardly hear the shot from the other policemans pistol mister sam was laying on the ground with his head in the sloppy place under the water faucet and his feet kicking up dust then all of a sudden he was too still the policeman called mike went to him and squatted beside him he took mister sams hand in his and held it for a long time feeling on his wrist then he laid one of his ears on mister sams chest and let it lay there for a long time listening he raised his hand for us to be quiet even though nobody was saying anythingwasnt either one of us hardly breathing he turned his head and laid his other ear on mister sams chest and listened so long that i wanted to holler cant you see hes dead after a while he looked up at all of us standing around turning his head slowly from one side to the other looking at us all his breath moving his chest coming out of him his face looking like hed come upon something he didnt want to believe and he was looking for somebody to tell him it wasnt so then his eyes got to lucy mae and he couldnt turn them away she was still standing on their back steps crying and calling mister sam calling his name louder and faster daddy daddy daddy daddy screaming his name somebody went to lucy mae and took her inside the house and got her quieted down but i could still hear her crying the sound of me everytime i pass by a street it was too sad for me i ran away named alley and see a bunch of from that sound but it followed me folk my color living in dingy little i had run a long long ways before houses not fit for poodles i can it came to me that the sound was see mister sam again buying a litcoming from inside of me it was tie pride with his life and i just my own crying its still inside of cant keep from crying and l rights by donald r hopkins here are i would say two elements of sadness in the present controversy being waged within the civil_rights movement it is very sad to see the traditional civil_rights movement dying in the inglorious man ner that it is and it is sad to see the new philosophy of the black ghetto being born in the inauspicious manner that it is ideally both events being patently inevitable would have occurred with so little fanfare that this country would have been reaping the ineluctable benefits of the new black selfconsciousness even before it realized that something dramatically new and exciting had been wrought in its midst unfortunately and perhaps to its ultimate damnation such is not the way of race relations in the united states where new myths and old realities lack even the tinny grandeur one finds in its international politics it is possible to look at americas attitude toward say the war in vietnam without feeling quite so nauseated as one feels in searching her attitudes toward black_power or any other philosophical position the black american may assume which is to the slightest degree at variance with the sacred attitudes of the white liberal establishment this is so because the impulse to war the avarice and arrogance of international power politics can be made out to appear more rational mistakes may be made in calculating the will to resist of a given people relationships become artificially structured and the course of human events takes on an internal logical cohesiveness to which the desires of individual human beings and nations become subordinate if white america has even this threshold control over its attitudes toward black america it is nowhere apparent one is reminded of a period a few years back when the popularity of malcolm_x and the publication of c eric lincolns book the black muslims in america made it appear that the muslims were threatening to set the tone of racial activities in the northern urban negro communities at this time there went out a great hue and cry from liberal whites and from the predictable dependable black bourgeoisie decrying the racism of the muslims praising the moderation of the bourgeoisie and appealing to the caucasian conscience to come to grips with the urgent problems of the ghetto before the burnbaby burn apocalypse to any rational mind the muslim threat was never potent even if we disregard the fact that from almost every conceivable perspective the end product of mem bership in the organization was to provide a benefit to the individual and the community the most shallow analysis of the thinking of rankandfile citizens of the black community would have dispelled any fear of an upsurge of militant muslim sympathy the black_power controversy provides the most recent parallel to this uncanny unfathomable paranoia of even the best thinking white americans this would not be so sad were it not for the fact that what the black community in america needs more than money jobs and education is philosophyor to put it better ideology the negro community needs to think collectively in terms that would sharply differentiate its thinking from that of any other racial or national group in this country and such thinking is the sine qua non the absolute condition to the permanent improvement of the status of the negro in america it is my suggestion as it is a basic assumption of black_power advocates that it is possible for a people to literally pull themselves up by their bootstrapsto miraculously stop behaving the way all the mindless dictates of history and sociology would have them behave such a people whose thinking has been changed by the grasping of an ideology which contains certain truths about their historical and social relationships can change the course of human affairs their thoughts by changing their own political and social posture can change the political and social posture of others black_power is a concept which demands that the black american effect such changes in his thinking now or we might say at last i would offer the white american a simple test take any recent picture from a national magazine which shows a poor negro family standing in the squalorous shamble of a living room in a tenement dwelling such pictures are easy to find for they have a great repute and are much in demand then ask yourself which philosophy the civil_rights philosophy or the black_power philosophy is more likely to get the floor swept first i submit that the clear answer is the black_power philosophy should for any reason whatsoever due to pride anger love whatever per cent of the black slum dwellers decide to sweep their own floors and patch their own walls a social revolution would be heralded that would resound around the world perhaps americas fear of black_power is a fear of this revolution which would so drastically alter the relations between the races in this country the negro as a social construct is not only durable he is useful it permits the white american to deal with the foreign element in its midst without taking it seriously as a human quantity the basic idea behind the civil_rights movement has been that if the negro is sufficiently patient the white people will get the floors of the tenements swept this is the movements conceptual infirmity as it assumes that the black man like a wooden puppet cannot move until the master has pulled the strings it is not clear how great is the investment the white american has in this artifactitious negro character his misgivings over black_power would indicate that the investment being built up over centuries is great indeed if this is so then this country is faced with a great crisis for it is highly unlikely that the faulty assumptions of the civil_rights movement will ever again claim the allegianceif it ever didof any significant number of black americans there is then no choice between civil_rights and black_power the choice is between black_power and the utter alienation that leads to wanton destruction of people and property the sooner the white press and politicians realize this the sooner will they be able to begin the arduous task of cultivating in the minds of the generality of white men a healthy and necessary respect for black humanity the creative possibilities of black_power by dr nathan wright jr theme of black_power in spite of much recent publicity q is not new on the american scene nor is it likely in the foreseeable future to come to a definite end regardless of the outcome of the current debate concerning the propriety of the term black_power black_power has been a continuing refrain in the history of the american negro the slave uprisings which were more frequent than historians often relate continually reiterated the black_power theme it was the clarion call of the rebel john brown and of the abolitionist frederick douglass again the sophisticated and angered web du bois and the militant visionary marcus garvey addressed themselves to the issue of the black mans cooperative strength and dignity and a philip randolphs brotherhood of sleeping car porters came together held together and became a major leverage in american political and economic life through a commitment to what militants today speak of as black_power to what precisely does the theme black_power speak in the negro churches it has most often addressed itself to a kind of black solidarity in a holy war where in an imminent latter day the saints of light who have withstood the evil onslaughts of the powers of darkness will receive their due reward howard thurman in his recent and perhaps his greatest book the luminous darkness speaks of the perception of his early youth that white humanity was beyond the pale of his morality such widespread feelings of the mystical uniqueness of the negro in his corporate life have been the backdrop for the political thrusts which we identify most often as black_power in its first several decades of militancy the national association for the advancement of colored people could be fairly identified with the alleged dissidents of today who speak of the critical force of the negros united strength reference to such an idea today is subjected to the frequent criticism that it is open to misunderstanding is subject to individual interpretation and therefore may be misleading as black_power speaksas it has done over several centuriesto the negros recognition and aggressive assertion of his own fundamental sense of dignity integrity and worth it would and must have at least flexibile implications for no two individuals can perceive of and assert their own validity and place in precisely identical ways the belligerent by nature will tend to express his own sense of being and relationship in bellicose ways the more temperate will tend to use more temperate means nonetheless there may be an apparently realistic danger in a mass rallying to the theme of black_power the negro people over the years have been encouraged by many means to suppress and sublimate their natural feelings of conflict and frustration in this light under a longpostponed and newfound freedom the potential catharsis inherent in the current call to the banners of black_power may be fraught with not unexpected and painful excess black_power may be seen to be a logical and perhaps muchneeded expression of the negros awakening to selfawareness by an overlydelayed and awkward stretching of his arms and flexing of his muscles as he looks half yet untested and unmeasured politibewildered at his newly felt but as cal and moral strength are negroes ready for black_power interestingly those who oppose the use of the term black_power have often raised the objection that negroes court annihilation once black_power comes face to face with white power such a vision of the armed conflict of two opposing and ludicrously unequal camps represents both a misreading of the intent of those who espouse black_power and a failure to understand the necessary dynamics of social and moral progress ethnocentrism or the consciousness of ingroup solidarity with a consequent sense of pride and power is one of the strongest of human sentiments what an ingroup or an ethnic community may be is defined by the culture of which such a group is a part the american culture has defined a number of ethnic groups including notably the jews the irish and the scotchirish who represent religious national or a combination of religious and national groupings all of these groups have intensive pride in their own membership and this is given expression in a variety of ways there are several singular and significant differences in the circumstances of the negros place or role as an ethnic group in american life the negros ability to express his sense of pride has been circumscribed perhaps nowhere has this been more flagrant than in the wellnigh completely successful attempts of the white community with the encouragement and complicity of the nations social scientists to have the negro forget that he is by and large a europeanamerican indianblack african hybrid the negro has been encouraged to forgetas in my own familythat the hickmans and the wrights our family names were of british stock and that the varying shades of color and different textures of hair are a reflection of a variegated ethnic ancestry by culture almost completely and by race to a fairly considerable degree the overwhelming majority of american negroes are of a european background yet the negros sense of limited racial and cultural pride has been restricted to his supposed african origins in a veiled and uncertain past rare is the writer of an american textbook in sociology or history who attributes to the negro anything other than pure african descent except in the semiderogtory sense of illegitimacy even here illegitimacy is an occurrence common to family strains and is simply heightened in varying degrees and by diverse means among the rootless and the oppressed black_power may be seen to be a form of ethnocentrism albeit falling into a trap set by the historically racistbound american culture with the complicity of social scientists who inevitably tend to operate hopefully with some objectively within the accepted frameworks of the society of which they are a part the negros sense of pride is further blunted by the seemingly unamerican assumption that the negros position of social and economic inferiority is immutable the last hiredfirst fired concept here may be seen to be not the multiplication of individual behavior but the logical expression of the mind of a way of life which rejects the negros sense of worth the negro himself has purchased stock in this endeavor partly by recoil in selfdefense and in part by imposed design the american negro has eschewed social equality no major civil_rights leader even today espouses as a major plank in his platform social equality at the very heart of which is the matter of intermarriage yet even economic survival and advancement as well as a sense of pride depend in no small degree upon relationships of a blood and legal variety negroes today are isolated from the jobs not only at the bottom of the ladder but from those so desperately needed at the top to begin a closing of the economic gap admittedly by an absence of contacts whom one knows is for white americans as important as what one knows for negro americans the failure to know people in those intimate and familial relationships which spell care and concern and mutual economic responsibility means no less than a growing fact of isolation from the economic and social fruits of american life which are theoretically their due inheritance the renewed impetus towards the concept of black_power here reflects the apparent readiness of many negro americans to give a perhaps still illusory implementation to their now hoarse and hackneyed and desperate cry of all here now are negroes willing to be aggressive a story is told of an advertisement for what was billed to be the most unusual show on earth the day came finally for the great performance and an audience in curious expectancy was treated to a oneminute show of symbolic behaviour twelve negroes were simply tugging hard at a rope when those who had come for the show demanded an explanation the producer simply asked where on earth have you ever seen twelve negroes pulling together what is apparently true of the american negro is true of all ethnic groups people are all unique and only at critical and measured points do corporate interests emerge for the negro this has been both bane and blessing hence with the current controversy over the use of the term black_power a consensus is sought where no agreement need legitimately exist the fact is that in spite of the massive economic and social signs and indications of the monumental failure of the american people to close the gap in any significant way between where negroes are in relation to their white counterpartsmany negroes are content with the current drift and trend of things negroes as all americans are generally better off today than they were at the end of world war ii the awareness of this fact leads not only many negroes representative of the man in the street but also a substantial portion of recognized negro leadership to speak with apparent integrity of the progress and gains which negroes are making yet the american economy generally has been growing by greater degrees than has the negros alleged progress this leads other negroes of a different type of perceptiveness and of equal integrity to reject the term progress with as great a degree of disdain as that with which some have rejected the term black_power the willingness to speak to the affirmative implications of black_power may be in a wellnigh precise relationship to ones conception of negro progress on this issue negroes are not and doubtless will not be agreed the figures for the relative income of nonwhites in relations to whites over a recent fifteenyear period are as follows the fact that there is no clear statistical trend suggests thateven if the figures may be radically improved for to the idea of a relative and secure indication of progress is for the negro an illusory reality further the current programs under the auspices of the office of economic opportunity and the extensive efforts of private and civic agencies on behalf of negro employment and upgrading are all in the direction largely of lower echelon and madework jobs these serve a basic and absolutely necessary purpose of enabling negroes to survive and of postponing the day of massive revolt in our present circumstance this is no mean purpose and must be given the fullest encouragement at every hand nonetheless the catapulting of significant numbers of the available qualified negroes into positions of high economic value and extensive influence at policymaking levels in our business educational and civic structure remains neglected in a way which may prove to have perilous proportions a sad fact which must be contemplated by all is that in spite of all of our efforts in the negros behalf in the recent past his relative stake in the benefit levels in the american good life have not improved at the same time that his perceptions of his own worth and due inheritance have tremendously increased this suggests the possibility of a heightened sense of polarization within the negro community with numbers of middleclass negroes having bettered their status being understandably under the illusion and spell of progress by the tangible and unmistakable reality of their own personal progress on the other hand however there may be in the days ahead growing masses of the disinherited feeling isolated and neglected believing themselves to be forgotten by their traditional leadership and ever more willing to spell out in word and deed the implications of black_power in terms of the frustration and depth of deprivation which they perceive to make their lot some economists believe that the economic system which is traditional to our culture calls for a fluid reservoir of untapped resource at its base if such a reservoir is neededas may be realistically perceived to be the case from its sustained existencethe rudimentary economic problem becomes a potentially explosive social problem when the group at the bottom is not heterogeneous being entirely of one group comprising both welltrained and some who should be there all through a sense of social injustice such has been the negros plight even with increased education statistically only a relatively small proportion of the economic gap is closed in most communities of america it remains true that only after most white unemployed find employment are the unemployed among negroes given basic consideration hence in our large cities there has been a recent rise from a per cent to a per cent unemployment rate among negroes between the ages of and while the rates for white youth in the same category have been going steadily down the differing lots of negro americans have thus brought about differing attitudes toward the problems of the present and the future human nature historically has not been fundamentally altruistic in terms of sharing power altruism has the sweep of its depth and breadth within the strict limits of our basically keeping the things that we have thus to hope for the aspiring and upwardly mobile negro and those in the secure white community to voluntarily side totally with those who perceive of themselves as the disinherited may represent the height of folly the cry black_power says my share for some for others it gives the totally unfounded illusion of threatening their accustomed or hopefully to be increased abundance can black_power really work the question of the feasibility of the use of black_power is mainly a rhetorical one the perceptions of the relative threat or advantage which others pose for us is always with us further power in terms of human dynamics cannot be calculated always in terms of numbers and this is especially true where morality is perceived to lie at the heart of the matter it is not a matter of whether negroes can express black_power but one of must in the sense that the negroas all who would grow up into responsible selfhood must domust give assertion to his own inherent sense of worth and being several centuries of admittedly crippling segregation and discrimination have not left the american negro unaffected he has been limited in this evil process and it is he alone who must stake his claim to the worth which for centuries he has been denied in this task of giving expression to his own newfound selfrealiza tion the american negro must stand alone no one may do this for him or with him it is so with our children in our own households it is true also with rising social groups here one may appropriate the famed analogy of booker t washington in claiming that today all americanswhite and blackmust be as one as the hand in all that pertains to the extension of the corporate national good life but we must be as separate as the fingers of the hand in the doing of that which each group must do for itself the staking of its claim in its own unpredictable and variegated way to its own due dignity and worth what then is the white mans role it is a changeless law of human life that each man must claim for himself the dignity of his own adulthood those who would deny to the negro this privilege would consciously or unconsciously will for the negro that he be less than what he should be what he would do for himself today has been the privilege of all other americans since the shot heard around the world if the black man has any power of place in american life it is black_power and so the term is simply descriptive of a contemporary and hopefully growing reality in american life as the negros response to the term black_power is mixed so is that of the white community many would applaud what they perceive as the negros coming at last into his own others who have been close to the american negroand who may find themselves in positions of worthy and much needed influence in our national and local civil_rights groupsmay understandably regret the current impetus toward black_power thus to carry the analogy of growth into adulthood further the lament of the white liberal and consequently of organizations in which he has significant control may be not unlike the lament of a foster parent who contemplates losing as a child the one to whom he has become accustomed to giving succour in the movement toward black_power the white liberals perceived reluctance must be understood and appreciated therefore as the difference of one who historically has extended the hand of friendship and upon whose help once the dust of selfassertion has settled the negro must continue to rely to what strategic endsaside from eventual growth and an ultimate furtherance of selfrespect can the movement toward black_power lead there are at least several national selfinterest the negros current restless and aggressive protest points in an as yet relatively mild and presently selfdestructive way to what may well be the massive irrational ultimate and widespread response to the continued arbitrary isolation of the masses of the nations negro poor from economic mainstream of american life either we develop all the nations human resources for their full productive potential and then open opportunities for their effective utilization for our mutual benefit or we create liabilities which become a sustained unnecessary and geometrically increasing burden upon both this and succeeding generations in this light the contemporary impetus toward black_power may be seen to be a restorative and conserving force in american life calling america to save itself from the folly of a myopic vision of what america in human terms is destined and called to be urban improvement the life of our cities needs to be redeemed the negros often angered protest represent the claim that social palliatives in our cities no longer apply and that new and fundamentally creative answers must be found for the sores which fester in the heart of our cities life our urban schools with their contemporary racial unrest remind us that the basic planning and administration of any enterprise at every level must be sensitive to and representative of the concerns of those who are served schools with proprietors as removed from their constituents as our urban systems tend now to be may be seen to be as potentially insidious as the urban system of absentee landlords marginal insights the negros present protest speaks to neglected dimensions of the meaning of democracy thrust to a considerable degree outside the center of american life the negro may be seen to be in a unique and enviable position of bringing new and saving perspectives to basic issues in our national life one such area to which his own pleas for an audience before the bar of american good judgment is that of the extension of the meaning of equality our religious and national heritage as well as the persistent experience of family life speaks to the equitable principle of taking from each as he is able and providing for each as is his need those who may be perceived to be benighted deserve our richest and best resources in enabling them to progress toward standing alone can a truly democratic society reach for less than this humane goal by virtue of his rich experience at the margin of american life we must demand of the american negro that through his fresh insights he ennoble as best he can the common inheritance to which we owe allegiance here a uniquely black_power may be seen to provide rich resources for us all changed status inevitably a declaration of a changed perception of his own position creates a changed racial situation with an altered nature to the problem new challenges await us which can assuredly do no less than provide some new groundwork in exchange for the old from which little that can be called true progress was achieved new conditions and uncharted paths are always fraught with peril we cannot foretell what the future holds in specific or detailed way for any implication or consequence of the impetus toward black_power but the assertion of human dignity and worthas we may learn from experience with our own sons and daughterswhile creating times of testing are productive of much good and growth and gain it is in the confidence and hope that the days ahead as well as the more distant future may be entrusted with its own problems that we built today the human aspect of our corporate life it is in this context that possibly we may come to see and accept as a creative necessity the current focus on black_power to the leaders of america power and freedom is of critical importance that the leaders of this nation listen also to a voice which says that the principal source of the threat to our nation comes neither from the riots erupting cb g our cities nor from the disagreements among the lead ers of the civil_rights movement nor even from mere raising of the cry for black_power these events we believe are but the expression of the judgment of god upon our nation for its failure to use its abundant resources to serve the real wellbeing of people at home and abroad we give our full support to all civil_rights leaders as they seek for basically american goals for we are not convinced that their mutual reinforcement of one another in the past is bound to end in the future we would hope that the public power of our nation will be used to strengthen the civil_rights movement and not to manipulate or further fracture it we deplore the overt violence of riots but we believe it is more important to focus on the real sources of these eruptions these sources may be abetted inside the ghetto but their basic causes lie in the silent and covert violence which white middleclass america inflicts upon the victims of the inner city the hidden smooth and often smiling decisions of american leaders which tie a white noose of suburbia around the necks and which pin the backs of the masses of negroes against the steaming ghetto wallswithout jobs in a booming economy with dilapidated and segregated educational systems in the full view of unenforced laws against it in short the failure of american leaders to use american power to create equal opportunity in life as well as in lawthis is the real problem and not the anguished cry for black_power from the point of view of the christian faith there is nothing necessarily wrong with concern for power at the heart of the protestant reformation is the belief that ultimate power belongs to god alone and that men become most inhuman when concentrations of power lead to the convictionovert or covertthat any nation race or organization can rival god in this regard at issue in the relations between whites and negroes in america is the problem of inequality of power out of this imbalance grows the disrespect of white men for the negro personality and community and the disrespect of negroes for themselves this is a fundamental root of human injustice in america in one sense the concept of black_power reminds us of the need for and the possibility of authentic democracy in america we do not agree with those who say that we must cease expressing concern for the acquisition of power lest we endanger the gains already made by the civil_rights movement the fact of the matter is there have been few substantive gains since about in this area the gap has constantly widened between the incomes of nonwhites relative to the whites since the supreme court decision of de facto segregation in every major city in our land has increased rather than decreased since the middle of the s unemployment among negroes has gone up rather than down while unemployment has decreased in the white community while there has been some progress in some areas for equality for negroes this progress has been limited mainly to middleclass negroes who represent only a small minority of the larger negro community these are the hard facts that we must all face together therefore we must not take the position that we can continue in the same old paths when american leaders decide to serve the real welfare of people instead of war and destruction when american leaders are forced to make the rebuilding of our cities first priority on the nations agenda when american leaders are forced by the american people to quit misusing and abusing american power then will the cry for black_power become inaudible for the framework in which all power in america operates would include the power and experience of black men as well as those of white men in that way the fear of the power of each group would be removed america is our beloved homeland but america is not god only god can do everything america and the other nations of the world must decide which among a number of alternatives they will choose ii to white churchmen power and love as black men who were long ago forced out of the white church to create and to wield black_power we fail to understand the emotional quality of the outcry of some clergy against the use of the term today it is not enough to answer that integration is the solution for it is precisely the nature of the operation of power under some forms of integration which is being challenged the negro church was created as a result of the refusal to submit to the indignities of a false kind of integration in which all power was in the hands of white people a more equal sharing of power is precisely what is required as the precondition of authentic human interaction we understand the growing demand of negro and white youth for a more honest kind of integration one which increases rather than decreases the capacity of the disinherited to participate with power in all of the structures of our common life without this capacity to participate with powerie to have some organized political and economic strength to really influence people with whom one interacts integration is not meaningful for the issue is not one of racial balance but of honest interracial interaction for this kind of interaction to take place all people need power whether black or white we regard as sheer hypocrisy or as a blind and dangerous illusion the view that opposes love to power love should be a controlling element in power but what love opposes is precisely the misuse and abuse of power not power itself so long as white churchmen continue to moralize and misinterpret christian love so long will justice continue to be subverted in this land iii to negro citizens power and justice both the anguished cry for black_power and the confused emotional response to it can be understood if the whole controversy is put in the context of american history especially must we understand the irony involved in the pride of americans regarding their ability to act as individuals on the one hand and their tendency to act as members of ethnic groups on the other hand in the tensions of this part of our history is revealed both the tragedy and the hope of human redemption in america america has asked its negro citizens to fight for opportunity as individuals whereas at certain points in our history what we have needed most has been opportunity for the whole group not just for selected and approved negroes thus in the slaves were made legally free as individuals but the real question regarding personal and group power to maintain that freedom was pushed aside power at that time for a mainly rural people meant land and tools to work the land in the words of thaddeus stevens power meant acres and a mule but this power was not made available to the slaves and we see the results today in the pushing of a landless peasantry off the farms into big cities where they come in search mainly of the power to be free what they find are only the formalities of unenforced legal freedom so we must ask what is the nature of the power which we seek and need today power today is essentially organizational power it is not a thing lying about in the streets to be fought over it is a thing which in some measure already belongs to negroes and which must be developed by negroes in relationship with the great resources of this nation getting power necessarily involves reconciliation we must first be reconciled to ourselves lest we fail to recognize the resources we already have and upon which we can build we must be reconciled to ourselves as persons and to ourselves as an historical group this means we must find our way to a new self image in which we can feel a normal sense of pride in self including our variety of skin color and the manifold textures of our hair as long as we are filled with hatred for ourselves we will be unable to respect others at the same time if we are seriously concerned about power then we must build upon that which we already have black_power is already present to some extent in the negro church in negro fraternities and sororities in our professional associations and in the opportunities afforded to negroes who make decisions in some of the integrated organizations of our society we understand the reasons by which these limited forms of black_power have been rejected by some of our people too often the negro church has stirred its members away from the reign of god in this world to a distorted and complacent view of an other worldly conception of gods power we commit ourselves as churchmen to make more meaningful in the life of our institution our conviction that jesus christ reigns in the here and now as well as in the future he brings in upon us we shall therefore use more of the resources of our churches in working for human justice in the places of social change and upheaval where our master is already at work at the same time we would urge that negro social and professional organizations develop new roles for engaging the problem of equal opportunity and put less time into the frivolity of idle chatter and social waste we must not apologize for the existence of this form of group power for we have been oppressed as a group not as individuals we will not find our way out of that oppression until both we and america accept the need for negro americans as well as for jews italians poles and white anglosaxon protestants among others to have and to wield group power however if power is sought merely as an end in itself it tends to turn upon those who seek it negroes need power in order to participate more effectively at all levels of the life of our nation we are glad that none of those civil_rights leaders who have asked for black_power have suggested that it means a new form of isolationism or a foolish effort at domination but we must be clear about why we need to be reconciled with the white majority it is not because we are only onetenth of the population in america for we do not need to be reminded of the awesome power wielded by the majority we see and feel that power every day in the destructions heaped upon our families and upon the nations cities we do not need to be threatened by such cold and heartless statements for we are men not children and we are growing out of our fear of that power which can hardly hurt us any more in the future than it does in the present or has in the past moreover those bare figures conceal the potential political strength which is ours if we organize properly in the big cities and establish effective alliances neither must we rest our concern for reconciliation with our white brothers on the fear that failure to do so would damage gains already made by the civil_rights movement if those gains are in fact real they will withstand the claims of our people for power and justice not just for a few select negroes here and there but for the masses of our citizens we must rather rest our concern for reconciliation on the firm ground that we and all other americans are one our history and destiny are indissolubly linked if the future is to belong to any of us it must be prepared for all of us whatever our racial or religious background for in the final analysis we are persons and the power of all groups must be wielded to make visible our common humanity the future of america will belong to neither white nor black unless all americans work together at the task of rebuilding our cities we must organize not only among ourselves but with other groups in order that we can together gain power sufficient to change this nations sense of what is now important and what must be done now we must work with the remainder of the nation to organize whole cities for the task of making the rebuilding of our cities first priority in the use of our resources this is more important than who gets to the moon first or the war in vietnam to accomplish this task we cannot expend our energies in spastic or illtempered explosions without meaningful goals we must move from the politics of philanthropy to the politics of metropolitan development for equal opportunity we must relate all groups of the city together in new ways in order that the truth of our cities might be laid bare and in order that together we can lay claim to the great resources of our nation to make truth more human iv to the mass media power and truth the ability or inability of all people in america to understand the upheavals of our day depends greatly on the way power and truth operate in the mass media during the southern demonstrations for civil_rights young men of the communications industry performed an invaluable service for the entire country by revealing plainly to our ears and eyes the ugly truth of a brutalizing system of overt discrimination and segregation many of you were mauled and injured and it took courage for you to stick with the task you were instruments of change and not merely purveyors of unrelated facts you were able to do this by dint of personal courage and by reason of the power of national news agencies which supported you today however your task and ours is more difficult the truth that needs revealing today is not so clearcut in its outlines nor is there a national consensus to help you form relevant points of view therefore nothing is now more important than that you look for a variety of sources of truth in order that the limited perspectives of all of us might be corrected just as you related to a broad spectrum of people in mississippi instead of relying only on police records and establishment figures so must you operate in new york city chicago and cleveland the power to support you in this endeavor is present in our country it must be searched out we desire to use our limited influence to help relate you to the variety of experience in the negro community so that limited controversies are not blown up into the final truth about us the fate of this country is to no small extent dependent upon how you interpret the crises upon us so that human truth is disclosed and human needs are met a new white backlash here came to light not j ritn l ng ago a pathetic ii document that illustrates the total alienation of the militant young negro and his pitiful inability to understand or cope with his problems the documentbelieved to provide the basis for the current uproar about black_powerwas drawn up last winter by stokely carmichael and some other young rebels of the student nonviolent coordinating committee and it dealt with the question of whether white people should play any major role in the civilrights movement no argued the militants if we are to proceed toward true liberation we must cut overselves off from white people we must form our own institutions credit unions coops political parties write our own histories if we continue to rely upon white financial support we will find ourselves entwined in the tentacles of the white power complex that controls this country we reject the american dream as defined by white people and must work to construct an american reality defined by afroamericans this all sounds very fierce but the motive for this paranoid selfsegregation lies in an openly acknowledged feara fear of white people and a fear of ones own fear in arguing for the exclusion of whites from negro meetings the supposed militants offer the explanation that blacks feel intimidated by the presence of whites because of their knowledge of the power that whites have over their lives a climate has to be created whereby blacks can express themselves the reason that whites must be excluded is not that one is antiwhite but that the efforts that one is trying to achieve cannot succeed because whites have an intimidating effect in this frightened definition of their own cause the tactically naive militants of black_power sound less like the cutting edge of the civilrights movement than like the advocates of defeat they resemble those ideologyridden dogmatists both oldguard conservatives and oldguard socialistswho prefer purity to victory who prefer no solution to partial solutions if power requires mass support then the rejection of anyones support means less power and if power requires money then the rejection of anyones money means less power and in this light the program for black_power is a program for black weakness and failure at the same time that the negro militants were talking about black_power in vague terms that show little connection between effort and result the more moderate rev martin_luther_king jr was leading his troops into the very center of the conflictand in a demonstration for desegregated housing in chicago he was met with a barrage of stones bottles and other flying debris it is significant that kings efforts to achieve a reasonable goal by physical demonstrations were finally confronted by brute force and it is significant that kings demonstrators were outnumbered by more than six to one for that is a smallscale version of the relationship of militant white power to militant black_power nor was chicago the only place where northern whites have resorted to force to counteract negro agitation whites too have their urban ghettos their fears and frustrations and mob lusts and it is worth remembering that in the great detroit race riots of the army had to be called in to stop the white mobs from a rampage that would have made the watts rioting seem like a musicalcomedy hoedown it is possible indeed that the violence in chicago coming just a fortnight after the standard negro outbreak inaugurates a whole new phase of the civilrights struggle we have been so bemused for so long by talk about the negro revolution that we tend to assume that revolutionaries must be granted their just demands and even their unjust demands and that revolutions are inevitably triumphant it is not true the english revolution ended with king charles ii on the throne and oliver cromwells head exhibited on a pike the french revolution too ended with the bourbons back in power in our own time the shanghai revolutionaries of were boiled alive germanys karl liebknecht ended in a muddy ditch and a soviet firing squad silenced imre nagys hopes of presiding over a free hungary since the first slave revolts of ancient egypt the history of this earth is in large part a history of rights denied and revolutions crushed in our own country then the danger is not simply the increasing extremism of the negroes but the potential extremism of the vast majority of whites who feeling crowded and threatened are only too ready to suppress this fragile revolution with all the violence at hand we are all let us face it mississippians we all fervently wish that the negro problem did not exist or that if it must exist it could be ignored confronted with the howling need for decent schools jobs housing and all the other minimum rights of the american system we will do our best in a halfhearted way to correct old wrongs the hand may be extended grudgingly and patronizingly but anyone who rejects that hand rejects his own best interests for minimum rights are the only rights that we are willing to guarantee and above those minimum rights there is and will continue to be a vast area of discrimination and inequity and unfairness the area in which we claim the most basic right of all the right to be stupid and prejudiced the right to make mistakes the right to be less and worse than we pretend the right to be ourselves when this majority right is threatened the majority will react accordinglywith results that could be disastrous to all of us by hoyt w fuller columnists and comf mentators are making much of the socalled white backlash against the civil_rights movement they argue with uncommon unanimity that the stiffening resistance of white people against negro demands as exemplified in the large vote for alabamas segregationist governor in wisconsin indiana and maryland represents a significant loss of sympathy among whites for the cause of equal rights the assumption supporting this proposition is that there existed prior to the eruption of school boycotts sitins lieins stallins and the ascendancy of negro militants a great store of sincere goodwill toward negroes on the part of most northern whites and this is almost per cent pure myth if such goodwill did exist for negroes among northern whites then how was it manifested was it translated into activity designed at lowering racial barriers against negroes in the norththese are important questions for the key to the nature of the whole crisis of civil_rights in the north lies imbedded in the answers and yet these are questions few of the editors and analysts are asking the simple fact is thathad such goodwill been prevalent among northern whitesthere would never have developed any need for boycotts and demonstrations and the moderate and responsible negro leaders like roy wilkins of the naacp would never have been eclipsed by the extremists if northern white people generally favored equal rights for negroes then there would have existed no racial barriers in the craft unions no nonnegro hiring policies by many industrial firms no practice of keeping negroes in menial jobs in those firms where they are hired no exclusion of qualified negroes from middleclass or white residential areas and therefore no allnegro schools with facilities equipment and instruction demonstrably inferior to that in predominantly white schools those who argue insistently that negro militance has hurt the negro cause neglect to offer convincing evidence in support of their argument it may be that such evidence is in fact quite small and difficult to come by it is even possible that the argument is used largely as a club with which to dis courage the growing nuisance of demonstrations viewed from the negro side of americas racial wall the proposition that there is a white backlash against the civil_rights movement takes on the character of a particularly insidious canard just what are these proponents of the white backlash theory up to anyway are they genuinely concerned that white sympathizers with the negro cause may abandon the struggle or are they attempting ever so subtly to blackmail negroes into submission surely any honest observer of the civil_rights scene who is capable of even moderately accurate perception must know by now that the white community tends to act in favor of negro rights only in the face of concerted negro pressure rare indeed are the instances where white authority bows to the principle of total equality of the races on its own initiative it is true that northern whites are reacting with some vehemence to the disruption of the status quo but are those who interpret this as a backlash unconsciously equating the status quo with the conditions of amicable race relations to negroes it would certainly seem so many of the whites who now are claiming disaffection with the negro cause because of some excesses on the part of some civil_rights activists or groups are actually revealing their own latent condescension prejudice and intolerance they are in effect seeking to punish all negroes for the behavior of a few negroes which is precisely the excuse southern racists have always employed now these people may proclaim themselves friends of negroes if they choose to but it is extremely unlikely that negroes have ever thought of them as friends this of course is another way of stating the dilemma of the liberal many whites who think of themselves as being friends to negroes would be embarrassed to read what amounts to a description of themselves in a book written by enlightened virginia aristocrat lewis harvie blair back in directing his words to those fellowpatricians who protested that they were gentle and helpful to negroes lewis harvie blair wrote in a southern prophecy but we forget that our kindness to the negroes proceeds from the standpoint of condescension and of assumed caste superiority and we expect it to be received with humility and from a feeling of acknowledged caste inferiority and if not so received by the negroes they are thought impudent and impertinent and the foundation of our kindness dries up the cause of justice and equality is either right or it is not and if it is right it does not become wrong because of the behavior of some individuals or groups concerned with it to say to negroes that their cause is just only so long as they behave in a way to deserve equality is not only to insult negro citizens but it is also to ascribe to white people precisely those powers over negroes which no citizen can have over another in a free society the point is that those who are defecting from support of negroes are those whose support was only token to begin with not only do those whites who believe in real equality still give unqualified support to the cause they also understand how and why many negroes are resorting to extremism these white people are not racists which is to say that they do not assign human rights and values according to race and therefore they are able to put themselves in the negros shoes and having done so they know that nothing short of death would prevent them from insisting that they have the same rights and privileges as all other americans and looking at the prowallace vote in wisconsin indiana and maryland from this viewpoint it is possible to be cheered rather than depressed by the results if wallaces pull of onethird of the vote really means that this proportion of the people oppose negro equality then it also means that the other twothirds are willing to accept negro equality indeed if the vote means any such thing it amounts to a great victory for the cause of equal rights in those two states of course no such optimism is justified what the country is finally facing are the consequences of its own timidity hypocrisy and neglect americans in no section of the country have ever been subjected to any intensive coaching in the honoring of negro rights quite the opposite has been true and even some conservative observers are getting around to admitting as much in a recent column in the chicago daily news john m johnston wrote nobody who reads the papers should be surprised by the wallace phenomenon it was not by oversight that a hundred years have gone by without spelling out the privileges of citizenship for negroes as is now being attempted in washington indeed it was not i suggest that when the full impact of the meaning of the negro revolution dawns on white america the vote in favor of states rights and against goverment interference will be even greater than that recorded in the recent wisconsin and indiana primaries for negroes are in no popularity contest and they are not asking for tolerance negroes are insisting upon their rights as free citizens furthermore it is highly unlikely that negroes will be impressed by the endless admonitions of moderation and pleas for restraint directed at them by whites white people have been telling negroes to wait for their full rights for over a hundred years in fact it is precisely because negroes failed to insist upon their full and equal rights in the north that many of the racial restrictions now prevailing came to harden into custom many people believe for instance that the question of housing segregationundoubtedly a central concern in the nations racial dilemmais a relatively new and particularly delicate consideration in the overall problem but such is not the case the basic federal law on housing was passed nearly a century ago in it provided a year in prison a fine of or both for those who violated the following provision all citizens of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit purchase lease sell hold and convey real and personal property however in the south custom was joined by brutal suppression in the conspiracy against negro rights writing recently in the reporter of the great racist reaction that overtook the country in the s historian c vann woodward had this to say in the south the reaction found expression in whitesupremacy propaganda segregation laws poll taxes literacy and poverty tests white primaries and other devises for disfranchising the negroes it was accompanied by an increase in lynching riots and other forms of violence against the minority race it resulted in driving the negro from all forums and avenues of political life in stripping him of many of the civil_rights and defenses he had gained through the reconstruction amendments and in reducing him to a despised and segregated outcast well negroes now are calling for a redress of all those grievances and it is the nations challengenot his aloneto see that the grievances are redressed with honor and dispatch in recent years liberals have replaced segregationists as the prime targets of negro ire writers like james baldwin and leroi jones have gone so far as to picture the liberals as millstones around the negros neck and poet calvin hernton flatly blamed the failure of white liberals for the rise of the black muslims these attacks of course were not leveled at genuine liberals who are relatively few but at that vast army of americans who mistake a patronizing attitude however subtle for a liberal conviction what most of these people mean when they say they are friends of negroes is that they dont mind negroes as long as negroes stay in their place and that place invariably turns out to be somewhere other than where full and unconditional rights of citizenship are a reality in other words these liberals tend to balk and to reject their convictions at the point where negroes insist on being simply men and women like any others with precisely the same rights privileges and obligations as other men and women and so whites in the metropolitan areas of the north are being flushed out into the openforced to go on recordrelative to their true racial attitudes it was one thing to strike a liberal pose in favor of negro rights so long as what was involved only amounted to a question of unsegregated seating on a southern bus or free use of a public park or even unrestricted service at a sandwich counter but it is quite another matter when this liberality is put to the acid test in terms of jobs schools and housing areas where some adjustment and possible inconvenience on the liberals part is required to make negro equality an unqualified reality white analysts of the civil_rights movement may choose to see a great white backlash but negroes remain unconvinced there is no surprise for negroes in the revelation of widespread bigotry among white people north or south what is happening is that the two major races in this country have arrived at the inevitable confrontation this is the true meaning of this moment this is the service governor george wallace of alabama is rendering to americans he is bringing us closer to the longpostponed moment of truth the time has come when white people are going to have to decide whether they are to be guided by the principles of justice and equality as spelled out in the constitution and bill of rights or whether they are going to submit this system of government to the rationale of racism we are now witnessing the weedingout process the separation of the true believers from the hypocrites from now until the resolution of the race problem one way or another white people will find it increasingly difficult to cloak their desire for white privilege in robes of genteel patronage malcolm the martyr by clarence major ven if nothing else in e y americas social and political fabric justif fied and promised the necessity of malcolm x the words of thomas jefferson would be sufficient if there be any among us who wish to dissolve this union or change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it but of course much more justified his existence though one cannot be sure yet how important his death will be for struggling men everywhere i must confess that i expected malcolm to be a great deal more dynamic in appearance than he was he was striking all right even engrossing but my myth of him was already very big and the man had yet to fulfill it in human image nevertheless the personal encounter remained a gripping one in talking with a white woman about malcolms personal appearance in omaha it was related t this reporter that he turned out to be from her point of view not nearly as militant not nearly as proviolence as she had been led by the press to believe however my informant was a confirmed socialist ive wondered for a long time in considering malcolms sincerity in his struggle for human rights for afroamericans if he realized fully surely he must have how intrinsic racism is to america or for that matter to western civilization one begins to suspect a relationship between racism and capitalism is it any accident that the word wrong contains the letters ngro excepting e but including w and the word right contains the letters ight excepting the letter w but including the r could this be a linguistical accident you know negro and white vranger hwit never mind it was late in the day of the day malcolm was assassinated before i heard anything about it and then it was over the radio and there were several white people writers and admirers of writers in my living room drinking beer they had heard of his death earlier but no one had thought to mention it to me and my reaction was intense then the white girl near me said im so glad he wasnt killed by whites theres already so much tension between the races he perhaps knew the depth of racism in the west but by the end of his life he began to see with faith a brotherhood of all men after his second trip to mecca why wasnt the white girl concerned about his death rather than in who killed him the answer seems obvious the account of that trip to mecca in his autobiography reveals a very honest sensitive and intelligent man whos death certainly did not deserve such a casual remark as came from the white girl in my home what makes it more significant is that the girl knew these facts from having read his bookat least in partas it appeared in a magazine but one does not begin to believe that malcolm had for even a moment accepted the tokenism offered at home in america he wanted and still insisted on nothing short of full human rights and meanwhile he was trying to interest various powers in bringing the united states before a world court to be tried for undeniable crimes against black people which recalls to mind that aborted we charge genocide a petition to the united nations civil_rights congress ny though extremely militant to the end he had begun to gain respect at home as a sincere voice esquire and post used him on their covers and literary and political journals carried transcripts of his speeches and articles about him and his ideas in a brilliant review of malcolms autobiography john woodford stated no man has risen from his societys dunghills to shine with more purity of purpose to scorch the blinking eyes of those who would not see a nation continually perpetuating a racist crime and to illuminate the paths of retribution more brilliantly than did malcolm_x we had to have malcolm and we shall have other malcolms his dream of justice for the black man and the brotherhood of all men are not to be taken lightly if one is concerned with the challenge of our times and the terrible condition the white man has put himself in i realized this when malcolm came to omaha to speak as i listened to him these thoughts were going through me on a brief tv news film before he spoke the revolutionary malcolm used the phrase afroamerican in an interview with a white reporter and the guy thought the pronationalist meant some group other than the socalled negro malcolm smiled to himself i think i know what he felt and thought at that moment looking at that chump rev r e mcnair rev kelsey jones and others of the citizens coordinating committee for civil liberties had invited minister malcolm to omaha to speak anyway these were christians who had invited a muslim to address them all over america black christians and civil_rights workers were turning away from the promise of the establishment the promise was apparently empty a negro man asked malcolm if the whites who had helped in the civil_rights struggle were not sincere malcolm explained that he felt they would do well to work in the white communities toward improvement of their own miserable white attitudes a white man asked malcolm why he left christianity for islam and the latter answered that if what jesus taught is christianity he had never seen any of it in america this answer brought a loud ovation from the black members of the audience i remembered that big redas malcolm was once calledhad already said at harvard the christian world has failed to give the black million exslaves justice for over years of free slave labor despite this we have been better christians even than those who taught us christianity we have been americas most faithful servant during peace time and her bravest soldiers during war time and still white christians have been unable to recognize us and accept us as fellow human beings today we can see that the christian religon of the caucasian race has failed us thus the black masses are turning away from the church back to the religion of islam asked what political system he favored malcolm said that he knew only this capitalistic one and it must he stressed suck somebodys blood to survive he added that the countries of europe were loosing their blood lines in their loss of control over colored peoples and thus the desperate and frantic erection of something called the common market and he also added as he had at harvard earlier already countries are cutting off american trade someone asked malcolm if he expected help from the colored nations of the world in the event of taking up arms in defense of human rights of black americans malcolm said we have friends who care about us and who are concerned for our freedom mao notwithstanding he said that all over the middle east and africa he was met with questions about the stranded black brother in the wilderness of the white mans north america youre not going to find all the whites on one side he said the white community was now split in its attitude toward the civil_rights issues whites who help us dont do so because they love usits only because they see the handwriting on the wall that were going to overtake them the black population explosion not long after this occasion i talked with a young man who worked with students for a democratic society and he flatly stated that whites were pulling out of groups like sncc because of the stronger trend toward nationalism in the light of what malcolm said this is the very root of coercion weve had nothing but legal tricks in the united states courts he said by staying in these courts you domesticate the situation by going to the international level youre taking america to a world court for redress his reasoning was in correlation with the great sociologist william graham sumners in that it was impossible to get justice for exslaves under a capitalistic system which is bom of slavery itself as he spoke he was a handsome figure he was just beginning to grow his mustache which by the time he was killed on february now called dhabihu sacrifice day by some was long and pointed malcolm responded to the acute resolution of mao tsetung who offered unreserved support of the american negro in his struggle against white imperialism at omaha malcolm made it clear that he was in full favor of a real revolution in america the socialist white woman said to this reporter everything he said was just good common sense there was an unmistakable tone of warning in everything he said while the press people there seemed mad and fuzzy running up and down the aisles in the story of his life malcolm later had the same tone in words he knew he faced an evil monster and he knew he was going to die but he had a vision for his brothers on earth chinese would be the leading political tongue of the future and arabic the spiritual whites would not always dominate everybody on earth malcolm little was one of the first negro leaders to really see that any freedom movement not international in range and outlook was foredoomed to failure he is physically dead now but it only proved to us that he lives more fully in our quest one of the truly sad things though was when malcolms younger brother minister philbert wrote a denouncing article about him in the january issue of muhammad speaks newspaper the article appeared on the same page with a cartoon showing malcolms head bouncing down the way of judas brutus and benedict arnold and in the same issue mr muhammad predicted a chastisement for the hypocrites how much do we ever know about the future malcolms half sister mrs ella collins stated i believe that his death was very well planned there had to be inside connections the people involved in my brothers murder had to have contact with a person or persons whom malcolm trusted malcolm indicated to me before he died that he felt he was being betrayed the murder of my brother was much bigger than the black muslims black muslims did the job but with others this wasnt done by one group his death was planned even before he was refused entry into france had he lived through the summer of he would have influenced great changes in america the power structure knew this his death was planned by the power structure of the west hers is the most chilling assessment yet he was liberated from the selfhate and shame which are the unfortunate lot of the masses and he was trying desperately to reach his brothers and sisters in the american ghetto who are still stewing in the fumes and burning from the cops bullets the west didnt give him a peace prize to cool him down but he reached the souls and minds of many black brothers who shall not let his name diewho shall not ever forget that dream of selfhood and nationalism he stood for claude brown the young highly successful man who wrote the book manchild in the promised land says you can call malcolm_x a madman a fanatic an extremistany of those thingsbut none of those categories erases him all i know is that an awful lot of negroes and i mean educated ones thought that malcolm was a cool and tough and dedicated cat whom you had to respect he wasnt going to negotiate with anybody he made you feel tough and right he didnt make you feel you were some kind of creep in a state of evolution brown also said for too long a time the power structure has been sitting down talking with martin_luther_king when they should have been talking with malcolm x but he didnt always get this sort of ovation in print by a nonwhite abdul basit naeem headed one of his articles for muhammad speaks newspaper with this title selfpublicity motivated malcolm not devotion negroes for the most part took a sigh of relief upon the death of elhajj malik elshabazz brother malcolm why though he put into words for them their misery they could not understand nor match his courage and they feared white people in power and malcolm knew this sad fact the challenge of his courage and loyal thrust toward truth as he saw it filled blacks as well as whites with fear and trembling he also failed to reach the black establishment for the same reason he didnt reach the white middleclass it seemed to them both that he was talking about something which had nothing to do with their attachment to things he was seen as a sort of warlord he was as someone has said an old testament avenger he wanted to keep the horror of racism before our eyes because we needed to know it consciously but by the time he became famous the country saw him as it always sees its scapegoats and he knew it america saw the death sign on his head and she saw him too as part of her soul she herself wasnt ever willing to face not long before his death in a debate with other civil_rights leaders malcolm said if you find a person without racism usually j theyre socialist or their political philosophy is socialism was malcolm about to crash the white myth for the whites was he about to crash it for the blacks and show both the lie they live in their white criteria which basely denies all humanity china in the future the end of o the white myth is it very difficult to understand why brother malcolm could not be tolerated in the west today he once said that the worst crime whites committed against afroamericans was that the latter i had been taught to hate themselves though he was officially given the cold shoulder by most negro leaders near the end of his life a few men and women began to take notice and to listen but the black brother has come all the way into the sacrifice and promise of his name and it is a good thing as we have seen in the past however war can change the face of the enemy change peoples lives but today we know war can also change the face of the earth the only thing we are sure of is that this is a time of challenge and that malcolm had a very real part in it a white laivyer named despres by david llorens nically enough j it it was just prior to i chicagos west side up j rising and martin_luther_kings assault on chicagos segregated neighborhoods that the agenda for a city council meeting included an ordinance to approve public housing sites each of them in negro neighborhoods a lean professorial looking alderman spoke to the matter in view of the present condition of this ordinance it ought to be defeated it proposes four intolerable family highrise buildings which our experience has demonstrated to be harmful it is bad city policy and bad civil_rights policy since public housing is nondiscriminatory it says that anyone who wants to live in public housing will have to live inside the segregated negro area and that no nondiscriminatory public housing will be allowed in the white ghetto outside the segregated negro area and what is proposed today is the counterpart of the policy we discussed at the last city council meeting when we considered the actions of high city officials who lead the government and public opinion and reside in buildings and belong to clubs which have rigid barriers against both negro and jewish americans point of order mr president cried a short stocky alderman this is irrelevant and flagwaving it has nothing to do with the sites we are considering the point of order is well taken spoke the chairman who happened to be chicago mayor richard j daley the first alderman appealed the order from the chair on the ground that it would be suppression of highly relevant discussion the chair was sustained with one dissenting vote perhaps the little drama will not seem unfamiliar to those acquainted with debates concerning the urban negro taking place throughout the nations large northern cities but chicagoans think their situation is unique the lean alderman who called passage of the ordinance a naked display of white power is leon m despres his antagonist who usually finds despres efforts on behalf of chicagos negro population irrelevant is alderman claude w holman despres is white holman is black but alderman holmanalong with five other negro aldermen is a member of the cook county democratic party better known as the daley machine and aiderman despres is an independent democrat not accountable to the mayor who also is the chairman of the cook county democratic central committee leon m despres was born in chicago in and has lived in the th wardthe ward he has represented since since he was a small boy the th ward consists of a large part of the integrated hyde park community and most of woodlawn home of one of the nations strongest community organizations the woodlawn organ ization a neighborhood where few but the merchants are white while political action chairman of the liberal ivi independent voters of illinois and engaged in private law practice despres was asked by fellow ivi members to run for alderman elected in and reelected in and in a bitterly contested battle in his opposition to the daley machine in matters of racial policy has become more vehement over the years rather paralleling the mood of the total negro community when asked how he feels about being labeled rebel and maverick by chicago newspapers despres smiles slightly and says well i guess it means i do not accept a very undesirable status quo a motion resolution or amendment introduced before the city council by alderman despres is almost invariably the prologue to a ritual usually beginning with a repudiation by alderman holman and frequently joined by other administration aldermen whose remarks often approach the point of insult despres candidly states holman responds to me on assignment from daley and keane alderman thomas e keane is the administration floor leader and the epilogue to the ritual seldom changes despressponsored measures are usually tabled sent to committee or defeated outright to critics who contend that despres could accomplish more as a member of the regular democratic organization the machine rather than as its chief antagonist he replies i could certainly as an organization man be more effective in terms of patronage and favors but less effective in matters of policy his independency insists despres allows him the freedom to advocate his viewpoints administration aldermen cant talk or introduce anything without permission the outspoken alderman contends that he has more influence on the basic issue of integration because through bringing up issues i can compel the machine to take a position and he adds though they wont give me credit despres cites for example his having introduced early in an amendment to the citys elevator code after four woodlawn children were killed as a result of mechanical failures of elevators the amendment which called for stronger elevator safety requirements was defeated however sometime later the administration on orders from mayor daley says despresintroduced an identical amendment which became law to the six negro administration aldermenoften called the silent sixpolitics means jobs status and money says despres he thinks that because they are negroes they cannot fail to understand the problem of segregation and oppression but the th ward alderman who was supported in his campaign against a negro attorney by such prominent chicago negroes as earl b dickerson and truman k gibson sr as well as by the citys civil_rights leaders thinks that the six negroes are less responsive to the needs of the negro community because they are in the business of living off politics i am not exactly what is the business of living off politics the political machine dominates the negro vote says despres with its mercenary army of patronage jobs from which a man is fired at once if he fails to perform his political work for most of those holding the some political jobs controlled by the machine the political work is precinct workdelivering the vote a former political appointee leahmon l reid now a newsman comments that it was not unusual for one who was reported to be not out ringing doorbellswhich was not a part of his official dutiesto be admonished youre not doing anything for the party according to despres in addition to delivering the vote political work might involve such things as control of the local naacp he also accuses the mercenary army of miscounting padding and buying elections despres thinks political organization is a necessity for civil_rightsminded groups but he contends that infiltrating the machine is impossible if you stay in the machine very long he says it in filtrates you the machine is completely autocratic says the aiderman the ward committeeman appoints everyone and can remove anyone he wants removed there are approximately political patronage jobs available to each ward and the ward committeemen which include five of the six negro aldermen are directly accountable to chairman daley commenting on the widely publicized fact that mayor daley does not tolerate much dissension within his ranks despres maintains that any adulation of daley short of idolatry is considered treason but he facetiously adds daley is not a dictatorhes more like the president of a corporation leon m despres affectionately called len by business associates and friends has consistently pleased civil_rights advocates with his positions he was one of the leaders in the effort to oust controversial school superintendent benjamin c willis described by despres as a man whose entire life has been devoted to hatred the th ward reformist has attempted in vain to push through stronger legislation on open occupancy he has been a familiar figure in civil_rights marches in chicago as well as having made the journey to selma in the spring of a strong despres resolution supporting the move to withhold the seats of mississippi congressmen challenged by the mississippi freedom democratic party was defeated in favor of a weaker admin w tr istration motion one of the more illustrious examples of the battling alderman in action was perhaps a seven hour debate over james baldwins an other country in which he led the opposition to the administrations attempt to ban the novel from a required reading list in a course at one of the citys public junior colleges moreover the session provided insight into the peculiar u situation of the administrations negro councilmen despres especially eloquent in his defense of academic freedom and author james baldwin equated chicagos tammany with moscows kremlin for its censorship efforts and called the book banning venture an attempt to discredit baldwin because he is a negro writer the six negro aldermen sat silently throughout the session but during a recess one of them alderman robert h miller told a reporter the city council has no jurisdiction in this matter he further commented on the ridiculousness of the effort but when the time came to vote on a resolution requiring the board of education to remove the book from the required reading list alderman miller as did the other organization men voted to ban the novel the resolution however later proved futile the session over baldwins novel pointed up the intellectual acumen which appears rather an anomaly in the citys legislative body of leon despres chicago reporter sam blair once noted that despres use of polysyllabic words during a council presentation while capturing the interest of high school observers left the other aldermen puzzled despres a man given to research can be seen taking notes during council sessions with a youthful zest that belies his years both his demeanor and scholarship are in radical contrast to that of his chamber adversaries whose staidness would defy even the ancient roman courts the alderman does not reject the label intellectual but reminds one but that does not mean that i am without human warmth or compassion as a critic of mayor daley despres is invective he thinks the mayor would prefer that city council never meet and maintains that all the decisions are made in daleys inner councils laughingly he speaks of the administration aldermens desperation to make themselves heard often at the opening of a council meeting as many as aldermen will read long speeches memorializing a deceased city figuretheyre real good at talking about dead men despres holds daley responsible for the perpetuation of both housing and school segregation he contends that daley while using the national democratic image and political patronage to hold the negro vote has catered to the segregationist vote by supporting the pattern of segregation he thinks the mayor is threatened by the presence of martin_luther_king jr explaining that the white community will react against the mayor if he is unable to contain civil_rights activity such as marches in the white community white segregationists become angry at people who thwart their hatred says despres although the six negro aldermen have consistently praised the mayor as a champion of negro rights despres without hesitation states daley is at heart and by personal conduct a white segregationist more often than not despres opposes the mayors appointments from those to the school board and library board to the mayors choice for director of the citys commission on human relations the commission says despres acts as midwife to the growth of the ghetto and of its director ed marciniak one of daleys highly touted appointees everyone knew that he was chosen to do the kind of job the mayor wanted done essentially a political cover up the usually quickspeaking alderman answers a bit slower when asked about black_power which he finds an elusive term despres believes the integrationists can save the city if you know anything about the conditions in the united states you understand the notions of black_power ive never joined with those who denounce the muslimswhose headquarters are in my wardwhich doesnt mean that i join them but i understand them segregation says despres can destroy the city he thinks whites should not expect special gratitude or favors for speaking out on behalf of the negro and asserts that you cant fully end oppression until the oppressed have complete freedom to express themselves the alderman described by chicago novelist ronald fair as the only real negro in city government foresees the cracking of the daley machine the place to break the machine says despres is the democratic primaryas an independent in the june primary this year a significant breakthrough to that effect was made two independent negro candidates beat the democratic machine for the illinois state senatorial candidacy and both were expected to beat their republican opposition in november some of despres positions over the past two years have drawn strong criticism from some of the predominantly white hyde park community organizations as well as the university of chicago administration which is located in his ward does he expect that this factor along with the heightened cry for black political power will hinder him in next springs election ive lost a little section of white support he says without a trace of worry but ive gained enough negro and white votes to offset the loss no matter what side one takes on the racial issue it is pretty generally agreed in chicago that when an issue supported by civil_rights advocates comes before chicagos city council one man can be counted on to both speak and vote in its favor but it seems so natural after all leon m despres usually introduces such issues who speaks negro by sarah webster fabio shapiro plays oneupsmanship with robert penn warren in the question he begs both in his negro digest article decolonization of american literature and in his introduction to harlem gallery while warren searches vainly but profitably by editing a book by the same name to learn who speaks for the negro shapiro asks a more loaded one who speaks negro his answer is the late melvin tolson his identification of tolsons language as being authentically negro is a gross inaccuracy which would mislead us into a familiar trap of liking someone for the wrong reason tolson was aware of the solons and sages asking what is a negro searching for his own identity from what he refers to as the ruins of his afroirishjewish grandpa and other racially mixed ancestors he asks who is a negro his answer that the negro is a dish in the white mans kitchena potpourri given in harlem gallery is too simple a truth any notion of negritude which extols the virtue of being a rotten pot with flowers and petals for scent is lacking a full understanding of this concept melvin tolsons language is most certainly not negro to any significant degree the weight of that vast bizarre pseudoliterary diction is to be placed back into the american mainstream where it rightfully and wrongmindedly belongs allen tate recognized the distorted mirror image of the pseudo neoclassical angloamerican diction and i think rightfully interpreted this language as a device of parody much of the dialogue in harlem gallery suggests a satirization of the onedimensional and contradictory stereotypes of negroes whipped up in the kitchens of the white mans fantasy world although i must admit to some difficulty in trying to establish a pattern of tone which would serve as a signpost to the degree of sincerity the poet had for his subject in certain instances tolsons use of the grotesque overstatement excesses of diction at each end of the spectrum suggest that his language was very much a part of the parody language for tolson was a device which enabled him to make his statement about life as he observed it a statement which all but defies paraphrase the language of the negro is classical in the sense that it never gets too far from concrete realities from the thingy quality of objects persons places matter perceived in all its immediacy by the senses and not through oblique references and artificially created allusory illuminations negro if anything is a languagelargely unassimilated and unletteredwhich cuts through penetrates things as they are reflected in spirituals blues or jazz lyrics to a core of meaning eliciting a soulful response to a moment of realization of what it means to be a human being in a world with a stranglehold on this awareness such a language is truly poetic in its lyrical impulse and cannot be faked paul laurence dunbar phyllis wheatley bessie smith mahalia jackson ray charles willie mae thornton langston hughes and leroi jones can come to a lyric with a widely diverse body of diction and still i think speak negro karl shapiro is not expected to understand this it is very difficult although not impossible for a nonnegro to be able to assess this quality leroi jones mulls over this difficulty in the dutchman when clay says you dont know anything except whats there for you to see an act lies device not the pure heart the pumping black heart you dont ever know that karl shapiro in his decolonization of american literature decries the fact that american literature is a countrycousin literature of england he describes it as a three century old child yet clinging to the mothers apron strings an orphan in a far away place filled with sentimental longing for home new culture in every country except ours mr shapiro reminds us is based on home country settler and native in order for an american to become so attached to english literature it is necessary for him to lead an imaginary life shapiro feels and laments the fact that he suffers from this common addiction which amounts to cultural amnesia for a jew he expresses his concern in the statement that living an imaginary english life meant living a phony life of the mind for i was not english in any sense of the word he speaks of the three phases of decolonization in our culture and refers to them as nostalgia assimilation and negritude of these he comments nostalgia is homesickness not for the good old days but for the bad old days assimilation means a cultural entente at the expense of any mystique negritude means assertion of the realities historical and mystical as well the negro he feels is luckier than the jew because there he is unassimilable and unnostalgic the biggest fact of life in the modern world of language he says a language in itself is nothing a literature in itself is nothing a literature is the expression of a nations soul and a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness shapiro assisted untermeyer in editing the modern american and modern british poetry in and by his own above definition of greatness the exclusion of claude mckay paul laurence dunbar james weldon johnson langston hughes melvin tolson and pulitzer prize winner gwendolyn brooks and all black poets writing in english fosters the status quo mediocrity which he deplores to say that the american artist who reaches back to the tradition is by his standards unauthentic is to place almost the total body of mainstream creativity into a bag the authenticity which he lauds would by its very nature be idiosyncratic and difficult and its significance stands very little chance of being recognized shapiro answers the question is negro literature possible by reminding us that given the context of his life in america only a pseudoliterature an uncle tom poem could be created by him and that it would be necessary for him as was the case of paul laurence dunbar to use a phony negro dialect as a medium because oxford english gave him no choice he then asks himself if there were to be an authentic negro medium where would it come from and timidly suggests the spiritual or blues as a likely source the difficulty inherent in shapiro launching a crusade to loosen the hold of the academic mind over poetry which refers back to prior commitments is apparent he must first free himself who would others free cultural amnesia is a historical reality of american negro existence a violent severance of past language customs and human relationships became a necessary prerequisite to the oppressed state that was to become his lot negro contraband culture traveled the long underground railroad of race poetry race music race folklore which is only recently surfacing switching to the main track a concept of negritude forged from historical realities and physical necessity and a races stubborn determination to be is the rich heritage of modern negro poets there are volumes of race poetry records of blues and spirituals to be rediscovered there is a growing body of world negro poetry to explore there is yet the too real daily confrontation of what it means to be negro there is still time to create myths from these realities in all their authenticity and it is a disservice to young negro poets to make them feel a necessity for an artificially created literary frame of reference it is sound advice that he gives when he says it would be better to ignore the existence of the literature of reference and to create whatever we think valid than to go on tilting at windmills this is what the beat writers did they were successful because they refused to take part in the academic dialogue melvin tolson was not a beat poet he was a part of the neoclassical scene whoalthough as able as any to attempt the quixotic feat of reviving a dead horse albeit a trojan horsewas denied a rightful place in this theatre of the absurd like many negroes of this period he was told to go back and perfect the art and then in the great democratic tradition he would be accepted into the society of the neoclassicists he accepted and perfected the art of classical reference as a pillar for an american tradition in literature but became victimized by the cultural lag that is common between the white and negro worlds about this time allen tate the nashville agrarian poets and other champions of this movement gave up this vain pursuit of doing battle with tilting windmills therefore while tolson busied himself outpounding pound his fellow poets forgot to send him the message that pound was out negro poets who did not go out on that kind of a limb could watch the public literary spectacle of mainstream american menofletters and at the same time nurture their own contraband art the fact that negro literary history cannot be traced through mainstream anthologies makes a pointed statement about mainstream american literature and life and the racist nature of this life at the same time it says nothing about the tradition of a developing body of poetry by american and west indian negroes from the revolutionary period to the present negro anthologizers fortunately such as langston hughes and ama bontemps have aptly anthologized this development only a writer who overestimates the innocence of the negro reading public would attempt to sell them on an unseasonable image of the modern negro poet negroes are very hip consumers whether the commodity is clothing or poetry poets like clothes must appeal to the moment and reflect the spirit tempo tastes of the time there is a bold slim line in the mod look an unadorned sophistication outmoded are not only the colonial frock coats of the great white fathers but also the zoot suits the double breasteds even the traditional pin stripe oxford grey with the wide grotesque lapels negroes are tailoring their own fashions this season the new garments promise to be better fits than any of the traditional secondhand outfits which were pawned off as models which suited their fancy who speaks negro any black man

night yes said her mother those who live by the sword powerful true is the word of god said her father one cannot gather figs in thistles you could hear the toads calling into the night you could see the peeniewallie fireflies aboutand night was made for love and desire and for a girl to choose her man the father of her children if the night breeze touched her cheek it was the fingers of her unknown mate and with it was the smell of the landof life as yet unborn in december the lignum vitae trees had blossomed and it was like a lady in blue now in may it blossomed again but the rains were comingafter the draughtand the pale blue blossoms were beaten to the ground and it was a time of decisionfor planting and she was reminded of the beauty of a woman here today and tomorrow she was

you are tightening a girth and she will be no use to anyone you have to break her gently like a mulefirst a bag then a saddle leading her around with a light load and remember to keep her neither in the center of the road nor too far into the bank side as she was broken so would she be she knew it herself and she knew why her father was hinting there is a lot of time everything comes to him who waits all one wants is patience patience when you are young patience to reach fruition patience when the night calls it is like the parched land waiting for the rain it is like the parched grass waiting waiting and everything is in embryo in february when she had looked across the low foothills to the seastanding high on the barbecue with the wind pressing her print dress around hershe had looked across the everdescending and undulating bottom lands to the savannahs and far away in the distance she had seen the white virginal blur of the great catchment to a tank awaiting rain and she had rebelled against the lot of woman to wait and wait perhaps forever and forever was the eternal hills the eternal sea blue far distant and dispassionate waiting for time and god know what waiting through the eternities of man and that had been february february of the parched earth and no one dared to plant day after day the sun had rolled like a molten ball across the skies day after day her father and the other men had looked at the skies and prayed for rain and day after day there had been no rain the parson when he preached spoke of rain he prayed for kindly showers and the people understood that their rainmaker was interceding with god and when they came out they looked for a miracle from the iron skies they knew it would come it must come but when and a girl seeking in her heart asked herself other questions of life someday i shall live but when but men seek water the earth and the green things thereof may apparently wither and die but man and the animals are mobile so they seek water and find it man must have love too he seeks it and then suddenlyout of a clear skyit is all around easter sunday is always a day to remember all the women are in white white the symbol of purity and of the contrite heart white as the slain lamb and here is the familiar spirit of god the only thing the common man over the world may have and the people are filled with the awe of it that a man should die for themeven for them the black people but what is color black people are like all other people they have the good points and faults of all other people but above all people they have had and still have the burden of great suffering out of this has come a great spiritual capacity but this is of the spirit what of the flesh the black people are strong black women are beautiful you can ask big joe here in church or fred there is no other woman for constancythere is no other race of women of such controlled desire and satisfying approach and even in church liza ann knew her father was looking at her and praying to god to give her what it was beyond his power to give her peace and happiness and the love of a good man for she was beautiful you can ask big joe and fred the parson will tell you that the song of solomon is analagous to the church big joe and fred will tell you it is a love song to a black woman it is liza ann sitting in church on easter sunday it is the lovely black column of her neck it is the smooth ebony of her flawless skin like unto velvet you can ask big joe and fred why should big joe go to church and keep away from drink why should fred go to church for a man who died for you do men die in times of peace for strangers do they die for men they do not know when in this age there is only selfishness and greed a black man shall go to church to look at a lovely black young girl and through love of her try to find the beauty that there is in life to find faithfor women believe how else can they live and they cannot live unless they love and love is trust but what shall a young girl believe the song of solomon is an analogy to the church look out over the parched commons to the earth look out over the faces of the black sheep feel the wind on your cheeks and listen to its whisper in the pimento trees and see the sun oh lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world have mercy upon us after the service liza ann had come out into the sun and her father and her mother had had her right along with them and everyone was saying howdy tata higgins howdy miss rosa howdy liza ann and the old black men had chucked her under her chin with their calloused fingers and said to her father tata where dis gal ah grow good looking to go and her father had been proud and they had said to her mother she take after you miss rosa her mother had chuckled and said in embarrassed pride go on with you maas joe and you maas alec and the old men had chucked her under the chin some more and the young men had dreamed dreams they had said howdy liza ann howdy liza ann and the rest had been in their eyessome tomorrow youll be mine and all the while she knew her father was watching themherself and the young men he would shoot stone dead the man who advantaged her he was a godfearing man but for his family he would fight in church and she had been thinking which of you all i cannot make up my mind which of you all if you want me come and get me take me make up my mind for me and she had laughed to herself come and take me haha not with pa around haha stretch out your hand and take me my god pa would have a fit and the thought of it had made her eyes crinkle with hidden laughter and the young men and the old men had smiled themselves and an old man had said whac a happy gal and now her father had spoken and every one had listened men and women it must rain please god if not we will starve i never sees a drought like this in all my bom days last week i been down to savannah and dem is already practically starvin the sins of mankind is heavy upon the earth and the hand of god has fallen upon us and the old men had shaken their heads never a drought like this they had puffed at their chalk pipes and had been lost in thought the women too had held the silence pregnant with hope she had smelled the land in the tobaccofilled air she had heard the land in their voices she had seen the red earth in their dark bodies her country her people herself waiting for rain in may the rain had come suddenly when the tamarind tree in the common opposite their house had appeared almost deadwhen her father had decided to sell his stockthe rain came suddenly in the night it had come first as a hesitant patter and then it had become a steady tattoo borne on a gust of wind hastening to the earth she had known then how the earth must feel and the dark faces of her father and her mother had turned to each other in the lamplight in the morning the world had appeared new she had come out to the barbecue and gone to the tank to see how much water had gone into it but first before she did that she had turned her eyes across the savannahs to the sea had turned her face into the wind and then towards the stone wall now wet on which a bird had been singing her father had come out filled with renewed life as if the rain had poured it into him and over his coffee in the kitchen he had announced that he would have a digging match the next week wednesday he had said going to plant out the three acres cross the common and the only way to do it and ketch the rain is to have a diggin match ill tell them man on sunday and you woman must look after the food ill get two bottles of rum now we got the rain we must keep moving he had been full of plans and he had spent the day in the buttery looking over his tools and mending a pack saddle her mother had said nothing after breakfast she had tied up her skirt in the billowing hoop around her waist called a pokopanya and had taken a hoe and gone out to the land behind the kitchen and began to plant corn you could see her digging a hole in the ground and then dropping the corn in it from a pocket in her apron and then molding up the hole with a bare foot the earth was receiving its own to give it forth again manyfold and liza annwhat had she been doing she was still waiting and it was as if her father had known her dissatisfaction once passing her he had taken his pipe from his mouth and spoken as usual apparently to no one everything comes in gods own time it is strange how time appears to fly when one looks back at it you spend all the days in expectation of an event and it seems a lifetime away and then after it has come and gone you discover that it had come too quickly wednesday morning had been upon them before they knew it they had hardly set a light to the large blocks of dried pimento wood that formed the fires beside the stone wall and put on the kerosene tins of chocolate and water to draw the coffee before the men had begun to arrive singing and shouting all the women who were helping with the food had been there already and now came the men singing bring me half a hoe come gi me yah bring me half a hoe and she had heard big joe roaring above the rest with a hoe over his shoulder bring me half a hoe and where had fred been he had been standing inconspicuously in the crowd and he had not been singing you never knew how these digging matches giving free labor to ones neighbor ever got under way one moment they are drinking large steaming mugs of chocolate and coffee and then they are off a great line of men is surging across the field they are digging potato hills in one mad frenzied struggle right across the field the hoes are rising and falling with all the strength of the wielder you never knew that men could work so hard and out in front had been the singing mansinging and dancing and controlling the match singing fast songs to get the tempo of the race making up his own words galoh galho they had gone across the field like mad leaving a straight line of potato hills behind them and now they were coming back and the pace had begun to tell twice more they had to cross the field they had begun to string out panting sweating straining every muscle and out in front had been big joe and behindit had seemed impossiblefred the spectators had been shouting and the men had been coming along with a desperate hurry big joe had never been beaten in any match for a year now and yet here was a challenger to the champion of the district to the people it had been only thatthe champion digger and a challenger to her it had been more than that the battle was for her it had been as if at the end she would be the prize and that was what she knew they hoped to getthe prize of her esteem the pace had told the same two had gone far out in front and big joe had become desperate he had hurried his strokes and put too much into the down swing of his hoe and fred had come up abreast then the race begun in deadly earnest one man it seemed had to collapse hill after hill they had come down the line and the old people had come to stand on the finishing line hill after hill they had been coming and then imperceptively fred had come ahead and strangely she had been glad a hill ahead could he hold it her father had spoken the greatest diggin match i have ever seen in the district and old custos the oldest man in the district had said only once afore i ever see a match like this and the winner dropped dead fear had seized her heart they had come on and on then there was a great cheer for the new champion they had been panting as at the end of a long running race they had only been able to lean on their hoes while the sweat had run down their dirtbegrimed faces and then it had happened someone had laughed at big joe and in moving he had bounced against her and she had drawn away and big joe humiliated before her eyes had said who the raas you drawin away from since when you become so damn stocious fred had dropped his hoe and hit him so hard that big joe had rolled on the ground then big joe was up roaring hell yah today she had stood petrified and her father had rushed big joe and big joe had hit her father knocking him down and her father had rushed for his gun the men held big joe and fred and over it all she had heard her mother shouting jesus christ tek him away before tata come out with him gun jesusah dont want tata hang for murder and then there had been a roar from the house and there was her father rushing out and bringing the gun to his shoulder jesus christ maas tata maas tata everyone except her mother fred and herself had run desperately for the stone wallbig joe well up in front and she not knowing what she did had taken fred by the handand suddenly the gun had spoken lawd jesus everyone had fallen flat on their faces and big joe had crawled behind the stone wall everyone had been screaming maa tata maa tata and her father had stood there and said that one was in the air to get you people out of the way i am just waiting for that sonofabitch to show his head and everyone had trembled flat on their black faces on the red earth tata higgins was known for his gun he was the greatest gunman in miles and he never missed not a target the size of big joe and everyone had moaned it was a saddening sound going across the field to behind the stone wall where big joe was hidden it was the end of time and no one moved for fear of tata higgins turning his gun on them instead and all the while she had been holding freds hand and he had put his arm around her and neither of them had realized that they were doing this even her mother just stood there waiting everyone waited for big joe to break from cover but big joe had lain behind the wall at last her dadstrangelylaughed and lowered his gun it had been as great a shockhis laughas the warning shot he had shouted everybody get up ahm not shooting anyone tell that big joe boy to get off my place and to stay off and when he came up to them fred and herselfand said drop in at the house anytime son and then she knew it was as simple as that by wilton sankawulo hat westerners think w of the african society today is expressed in two radically different ways the one is an apology for the african situation the other is a sharp condemnation directed towards some stagnant elements in african society and the many misadventures used by africans to remove them but none of these evaluations has been successful in producing any positive effect than can achieve the goal of creating a better flourishing society because the two of them have not as yet been received in good faith by africans this situation can only be redeemed by creating a meaningful dialogue between africa and the west africans cannot allow themselves to be deceived when westerners tell them that they have been right all the while and that the negative judgment they rendered against them was due to ignorance the fact that the african society is relatively stagnant shows that something is fundamentally wrong which must be discovered and excised for the sake of progress a professor of mine used a quotation from andre gide at the beginning of a book he wrote about the kpelle people which is this the less intelligent the white man is the more he feels that the african is stupid but it is not lack of intelligence that is mostly responsible for the condemnation in many cases evaluation of the african society has been conducted by wellmeaning specialists in anthropology history politics and religion if their efforts fail to get at the heart of the matter is is because they have been restricted to the material culture of the continent and have not entered into a real dialogue with the people any man given all the practical evidences of the situation will have to be negative in his judgment of them lets face it the people are poor plagued by superstitions incompetent leadership disease ignorance etc progress however cannot come about by telling them to transform the entire continent for it to develop after the pattern of western society those who advocate this point of departure would say all that is needed is time time will bring about the necessary change western culture which cost westerners hundreds of years to produce cannot be imposed upon these people in an arbitrary way if it will be useful and beneficial to them but time itself is only an historical phenomenon if it is not rightfully used there is no guarantee that progress will come about by itself the reason for progress in the west is not to be found in time but essentially in the western spiritthe restless search for something better the comparative dissatisfaction with what is already possessed if the individual is convinced that what he is doing or what he already has is good enough he will never see any reason for seeking something better he will always hold fast to it if time is not used as the condition for change it is education which is advocated but again education by itself does not bring about change of course i believe what bertrand russell saidthat the man who is in a house which is on fire will be in a better position to save himself if he knows how to get out than another man in the same situation who does not know how to get out but it is still true that a man in a burning house may know how to get out and refuse to save himself many of those who are violently opposed to improvement and progress in africa are educated africans they are the ones who become excessively defensive of the african culture and take suit with the westerners who are apologizing for it it is not uncommon to see a university graduate reverting to superstition as a valid way of coping with mental problems in africa in witch doctors and psychiatry judith randal writing for harpers magazine defends the psychiatric practice of dr lambo a nigerian psychiatrist using witchcraft to treat mental patients as a scheme that makes sense her argument is that this method of treating mental patients is good for this special society but the question is not whether dr lambos psychiatric practices discharge rate compares favorably with that of the best western mental hospitals or not but is it a realistic solution of the problem it is easy to make a sacrifice in order to eradicate the fear of lightning which is prevalent among natives of west africa but one must be prepared to make another sacrifice when the fear of lightning is replaced by the fear of spirits or darkness or rain even though a wholesale importation of psychiatric practices from the west may not solve the problem it doesnt mean a sentimental reversion to the ancient practice of witchcraft will do i think this reversion of the african to his old archaic formulas for the solution of social problems is done much more out of protest rather than realism the african must make a truce with the historical reality in which he finds himself the european has come and ruled him and in this ruling the african has suffered the loss of his own value systemhas been encouraged to follow western standards which in some crucial cases may not apply to his own circumstances but this does not justify the african culture as such improvement is needed to make this improvement the african must search deeply in his own spirit in his own problems to know where improvement is needed there is no easy answer to this problem what judith randal regards as making sense is not to be misunderstood however most westerners who support the africans retention of his own culture have good intention they tell us of the dangers africans must reckon with in modern civilization the problems of migraines neuroses and the complicated nature of modern life which entails nervousness they are exceedingly impressed by what they consider as the innocence of the noble savage the peaceful village life the absence of crime in the clanvirtues which are all radically destroyed wherever modern civilization takes sway but mankind must learn to appreciate the fact that life at all levels is never lacking in danger perhaps outwardly we may be impressed by the innocence and peace of the village life but it is threatened by disaster as much as modern urban life the villager is subject to the assault of wild animals diseases low rate of production in farming thus famine superstition and fear etc he like his modern counterpart for whom life has become extremely complicated is not safe what he needs is the knowledge to cope successfully with the demands of development the modern westerner may be suffering from the complication of modern civilization because perhaps he had no civilization more advanced to learn from its mistakes but the african has the advantage to recognize in the western world the problems that go with developed civilizationand to help him is to train him to handle these problems to live in his socalled innocent and peaceful village is in fact more dangerous and unnecessary for he would be subject to problems that could be solved by modern technology and so we come to the conclusion that things as they are in africa are not progressive and satisfactory the fundamental mistake which africans and westerners have been making in trying to bring about progress is the advocation of one of two extremes that cannot work the first extreme position is as indicated the acceptance of things as they are with the opinion that they are good and meaningful and must not be disturbed by bringing in modern civilization itie second extreme position is the advocating of a wholesale importation of western civilization far more insight into these positions i would like to deal with two typical books written by two westerners in trying to justify them the first book is called new song in a strange land written by esther warner the problem with this book is that it is superficial like the books of laurens van der post it praises the african life without compromise what esther warner is telling us in effect is that the africans in fact have something to teach westerners their civilization or way of life is good and honorable and all the westerner must do to discover this is to become an anthropologist she is duly impressed by the innocence and wisdom of africans and every statement they make concerning certain facts of life is invested with rich meanings but i think all the implications or meanings she derives from the africans are more or less what she brings into their thoughts rather than what their thoughts contain with her sophisticated western education it is easy for her to take seriously something that africans may say in error or ignorance or jest this is primarily due to the fact that the africans she dealt with were not essentially educated she dealt with ordinary native men who worked around her house and she did not really know their languages when an african man tells her that a missy cant know he is apparently expressing his inability to communicate his knowledge to her he is not implying the fact that he has some insight into reality which a westerner is unable to understand esther warner of course is aware of the desperate pathetic nature of the african life she took a trip into lomaland to see superstition at work and the unnecessary tremendous toll of life it took she recollected this in another book called seven days in lomaland and so we might then ask why in new song in a strange land she attempted to defend such a life her defense might have been invoked by the fact that she discovered the immensity of the problem with which the africans must wrestle the extent of the difficulties does not permit any optimistic hope of finding a possible immediate solution but to find a means of solution is to have an adequate knowledge of the problems which unfortunately she lacked in another book the silkcotton wood tree she tried to describe the problems as intimately as she could and her apparent failure at an honest evaluation was still due to a lack of insight into them for instance she had a girl explaining to a boy the secrets of the womens society the fact that this is an unforgivable sin to commit is balanced by her immodest narration of it in every conceivable way she proved to be totally strange in the land and thereby the problems of the land remained strange to her in a book of fiction like the silkcotton wood tree the protagonist should have been a westerner i think a westerner who wants to evaluate the problems of africa through fiction must use as his protagonist one of his kind whom he understands writers like w somerset maugham and graham greene have been successful in writing about foreign places because they chiefly used this device this is still looking at things with the eyes of a westerner but at least the danger of misrepresentation will be minimal we will know exactly that the evaluation of the problems shows the westerners point of view which is important for africans to know what you take yourself to be must be balanced by what somebody else takes you to be out of the medley of such observations you will come closer to what you really are left to your own devices and judgments you may believe that you are very important or very unimportantor glorify or condemn certain aspects of your personality which someone from the outside could view objectively and judge fairly africans welcome criticisms from the outside although they must yet realize the importance of criticisms from the inside they would readily accept the criticism of someone from the west and bar their own people from criticizing them it is a dangerous thing to live by the opinions of others to the exclusion of your own from the experiment of esther warneran experiment which most westerners are urgingwe realize that a sentimental attempt to preserve the african culture as it is is impractical but the alternative of changing it radically as urged by jens larsen cannot be the rule anyone who accepts reality as it is and not as he wants it to be will find in jens larsens tom toms a classical and dramatic presentation of the african situation jens larsen presents as his main character kwoli a traditional kpelle wan who in a way peculiar to himself and in the world in which he lives returns home upcountry from a socalled civilized community in sierra leone in kwoli we are made to see a frantic attempt to redeem a lost humanity in an acceptable social term namely western civilization he clearly has a rational motivation even if it should be rooted in a vague apocalypse which he believes will be and can be realized given the necessary attention and effort indeed kwolis aim is genuine and great he sees the effectiveness of western civilization and hopes to use it to redeem his homeland from superstitions for progress while he opposes superstitionsor what he considers to be superstitions he is forced to be resilient to their pressure perhaps until the right moment when he can successfully eradicate them he goes into the bush school mens secret society to become an initiate of itthereby becoming a fullfledged member of the tribe kwoli then is caught between two social realities african and western it is hard to understand if his acquiescence to the african tradition will necessarily lead to the establishment of western civilization but the most important thing is not to know how kwoli will resolve this difficulty but to know the propriety or need of changing the social structure as a whole one does not need to go very far in reasoning to realize that this attempt to change radically the african society is a selfdefeating attitude for one thing kwoli holds the traditional culture in contempt and in his imagination it is a necessary evil which must be eliminated perhaps if kwoli had approached the situation with a disinterested attitude of mind to find out the main problems to solve them we could hope that he would be successful in redeeming the society the life of any people no matter how primitive or advanced it is has some positive and negative aspects where the negative aspects exceed the positive as in this case the tendency is to dismiss it as unrealisticand evil people everywhere have their own sense of values or concept of reality which can only be modified and enhanced but not destroyed to destroy it is to destroy the people and if kwoli is chiefly concerned about performing works of destruction we cannot see how he will ever redeem the people the predicament in which kwoli finds himself is due to the fact that he is not really educated in western civilization to the uneducated manas he isthe modem civilization may appear very attractive an adoption of it is more important than using it to solve problems jens larsen maintained a very significant logic in the development of the story when he showed that kwoli needed more education he had been serving as a porter for bradley a surveyor who had heard about a missionary in the area and advised kwoli to go to him for more education i should like to keep you but for your own good ill turn you over to the missionary when he comes i know he will be glad to employ you as a helper and give you private lessons he must take the long and hard road of learning this new tradition before passing it to others with more than a superficial understanding of this tradition he shall most probably discover a way of using it for the benefit of his people and not their destruction after breaking this illusion in kwolis life in the first part of the book jens larsen indefensibly falls in the same trap he tried to avoid instead of trying to show kwoli getting enough education to come and use it for the development of his society he repeats the same message which he gave us before in the first part of the book the need for change in fact the message becomes much more eloquent and vehement the missionary langdon i out of his frustration and disap pointments writes a long letter to the home church in justifying his lack of satisfactory statistical records of converts which alone would convince them that every dollar they contribute to the work is bringing satisfactory results as if spent elsewhere i think it is very unfair to compare mission work in africa with mission work elsewhere in the world in the asiatic mission fields for example missionaries have for the most part been able to build upon a foundation of culture developed through centuries just as st paul did in greece and rome at the beginning of the christian era but in africa in general and in liberia in particular it is entirely different here in the interior of liberia the negro is still living in his state of primitiveness our task then is not only to introduce christianity but also to create a culture to serve as a foundation for it and this takes a long long time perhaps what jens larsen did not realize was the fact that everybody in the world is already cultured you cannot create a new culture anywhere the problem is to accept what is already present and modify it or improve upon it another thing he did not realize was the fact that the transmission of christianity cannot be identified with the transmission of culture in the asiatic mission fields where culture is present missionaries are getting as much difficulty in christianizing the people as in africa in fact the presence of a formal culture may be a tremendous hindrance to the advancement of christianity more than anything else st paul failed to convert the philosophers in athens the day must yet come for a buddhist to leave his religion for christianity but it is not only at this point that we see a serious flaw in the book all of a sudden we see kopu appear in it kopu really eugenie is supposed to be the daughter of a professor of howard university she was kidnapped when she was a little child while her parents traveled with her through the liberian jungle she lived and grew up in this jungle the incidents centering around kopu are real and true but she is caught in them in innocence children who were kidnapped by the leopard society when it existed in liberia must definitely be related to the kidnappers it was rareto some extent unimaginable that a stranger a white person at that could become a part of a tribal mystery rather than a tribal warfare her presence is nothing less than an attempt to reinforce a strong advocation of western culture for africa in a much more serious way it is a judgment against the african culture as a whole and its need for complete change perhaps we should stop exploring the book at this point the problem as i see it that the africans must struggle with is the attempt to discover what they really want and to work realistically towards it they have to evaluate the african situation as they are experiencing it and work towards improvement it is an african problem if the westerner does not sympathize with africa he will condemn africa if the african man does not approve western civilization he will accept it in a most radical way all of these attitudes are simply evading the real issue the africans need to find out what he really wants and to work towards achieving it without adopting any easy formula there are africans who are trying to compromise or reconcile western civilization with the african civilization this also is unrealistic while some features of western civilization may be useful in africa there are many other features of it that are unsuitable to the african situation and so there is no way of playing safe at this point the african must find out what he needsand if he should escape this fundamental necessity there will never be an improved advanced africa the african countries will always be in the developing stage and what africans will have to reckon with perpetually will be the two cultures african and westernand they must use them as means to the end of developing an appropriate african society it is not a matter of choosing between the two or trying to reconcile them tm worried about a manchild by nikki giovanni hat problems occupy me personally well im worried about a manchilda manchild who will inherit this a black manchild in the quest for his lost manhood does he know what hes looking for will i have to become a white woman before he can claim it sometimes it seems thats what im supposed to be now that he is on the move im castigated for being a black womana strong black woman who has fed and clothed him and his children since he has decided the time is now must i play the silent innocuous thing who suddenly doesnt have the strength to open a jar of pickles let alone organize a block club for fear of castrating him is it necessary that i cease being a black woman so that he can be a man is it fair it seems to me that we are involved in several protest movements none of which should be based on innateness his sex has given him no innate right to rule im worried about a manchild who says hes making a revolution with the nonwhite peoples of the world if hes making revolution its with the colored people the world is colored and noncolored not white and nonwhite thirteen per cent of the world has no right to decide how the other per cent will refer to itself and if my manchild allows that minority to decide he is not making revolution hes not even off the plantation im worried about a manchild who says the colored people on relief unemployed or unemployable are not worth trying to get to because they are illiterate and dont understand the revolution i wonder why now that he is hip to the i was going to use a bad word but decided to play the lady bit coming down he isnt more patient with his unenlightened brothers hell spend all day talking to a liberal but doesnt have five minutes for the man nobody has time for i wonder when well quit playing bull fight you know the bull gets out there and tries to kill the cape dont be like that bullgo for the man jews get used too im worried about a manchild who says he wont fight until all other afroamericans are ready to fight that attitude is the reason we have a protest movement instead of a revolution and im especially worried about my lover in vietnam who thinks he should be killing somebody elses manchild but every time stokely carmichael opens his mouth every time leroi jones picks up his pen every time i see a malcolm_x button or a think black bumper sticker i know we are on the road to revolution we used to think we could hitchhike our way down freedom road but what they did was to put us on protest highway while they took the white supremacy express well we put a panther in our tank and robert williams at the wheel and turned the car toward mecca the most important step we have made toward revolution is the step away from the west but we have only made steps ram is a step goal is a step the muslims are a step and we must recognize them as such all we are doing now is getting ready to revolt we are on the road and roads have ends at the end of this road will be the revolution not the completed change but the painful beginning at the end of this road we will have decided that policemen should not carry guns we will revolt to see to it that they dont at the end of this road we will have decided that the only property man is entitled to is the house he lives in we must revolt to our own neighborhoods we will have decided that everyone should have a guaranteed annual wage and adequate medical care regardless of age that the state should pay people to travel to learn languages to attend college and graduate school before it starts we will know that there is room on this earth for any number of different peoples and that we do not have to annihilate any group before we can be free take power from themyes but to speak of wiping them out thats such a white solution and i am not picturing any revolution that will not begin for another years i fully expect to be free and to taste the fruits of the power tree that has been de nied me it will take blood some of theirs this time and it will take daring but we will do it reprise in new york arly last october e during a state visit to the united states by president leopold senghor of senegal the american committee for the first world festival of negro arts feted the african diplomat at a reception in new york city the reception also served as the occasion for the presentation of awards to american winners of prizes during the international festival last april while scores of invited guests appeared at the rebekah harkness house for ballet arts for the ceremonies some of the prize winners were not present notable among those absent were abbey lincoln and ivan dixon winners of acting awards for their starring roles in the film nothing but a man however the films coproducer robert young was on hand other prize winners who did appear were robert hayden winner of the grand prize for poetry and dr kenneth b clark winner of the grand prize for a book in the social sciences poet langston hughes accepted the grand prize for painter william majors and musician louis armstrong for the hello dolly album and sigmund galloway accepted the grand prize for his wife mahalia jackson for her album greatest hits among the writers painters and officials present were jacob lawrence rosa guy richard saunders and marian anderson by millicent dobbs jordan ow that the impassioned fervor of identifying with blackness for the sake of blackness has become so familiar one feels a need to assess the meaning and value of negritude could it be a sour grapes device sophisticated flippancy or merely whistling in the dark pun intended this was the great themequestion of the first world festival of negro arts held in dakar senegal april officially or unofficially the word negritude was on everyones lips for many it was an old word for others it was quite new but for negro americans it was the latest variation of soul who needed to define soul though you either had it or you did not have it inexplicable or not soul is a tenuous intangible esprit de corps as it were as old as slavery itself the american descendants of africans knew from the earliest days of servitude that their sins would find them out and their sin was in their skin it was so easy to identify a runaway slave that eventually a curse became a blessing the slaves had to stick together to comfort each other to try to establish a workable morale they learned this lesson well and handed it down from generation to generation in spirituals through prayers and in unspoken empathy were all in this damned leaky boat together are we going to sink or swim and gradually there came into existence various techniques for survival the most significant one germinating in the minds of the dark brother mere selfassertion was not enough there was a need for prideinnegroness dont be ashamed of being a negro later grew into bolder doctrines of race pride it became necessary to move beyond the negative concept of raceconsciousness so as to say quite positively that there are values to be derived from being negro hence a therapeutic creation of soul the seeds had been sown as early as the eighteenth century when negro poets orators and writers such as phillis wheatley torn from her native senegal at age seven or so george moses horton and frederick douglass centered their thoughts around the virtues of freedom and liberty for all in america the more militant marcus garvey born in established the back to africa movement the gifted paul laurence dunbar became the uncrowned poet laureate of negro america his poignant little brown baby wif spaklin eyes allowed negroes to look at themselves without shame the nordic standard of beauty became irrelevant this attitude became more crystalized by the erudite w e b du bois who wrote souls of black folk in however it was not until after world war i that many people began to reevaluate old established patterns of thought during the late s there emerged in uptown new york city a genuine cult of negroness called the negro renaissance by many it focused attention sharply on the fact that the negros views of himself were diametrically opposed to the white mans views of the negro generalization though this may be in essence it is true harlem then became the heart of negro americahomea place where a negro could be comfortable being a negro a group of brilliant young negro artists primarily writers started publishing beautiful proud soul messages to themselves and to all other negroes handsome globetrotting young langston hughes dared to make the world accept the blues the humor the everydayness of the negro he and other writers such as james weldon johnson countee cullen rudolph fisher waring cuney claude mckay and sterling brown infused into the hearts and minds of young black people long before world war iithe idea that the negro had a talent a gift a meaning quite simply they called it soul it was not difficult for a negro to catch the message it was sent in many ways through a song a book a sermon a jam session or through a downhome meal the message further said weve got something the white man doesnt have and the white man in his ambivalent suntanning haircurling nightclub singing way wants it too this soul thousands of miles away from harlem in the african country of senegal a sensitive young intellectual leopold sedar senghor later educated in france used his poetry to express great pride in black africa he called it negritude president senghor of senegal gave the opening address of the first world festival of negro arts at the colloquium on negro art in the life of the people dakar senegal he set forth the function of the festival by spelling out the function of negro art in the life of the black man he explained saving us from despair this negro art sustains us in our effort toward economic and social development in our determination to live two other events of the festival may help to illuminate the aspect of negritude the first occurred on easter saturday in a very inventive production of the passion play called the dark disciples blues version of the st luke passion though the story was old the interpretation was new this time the actors were black jesus mary pontius pilate the disciples it was only when judas came forth to kiss jesus that one saw a white face this was negritude in a moment of exquisite subtlety the other event was a moment of history called goree though the festival offered authentic dance troupes by the dozen poetry recitals drama cinema and fantastic art in resplendent array one encountered a sense of destiny a confrontation with ones past when he embarked for the island of goree only a short distance from dakar small easily fortified goree provided a natural quarantine of such strategic importance that it became the most important slave market in africa no visitor could be properly prepared for the actual sight of the slave dungeons yet there they weremute testimony to unspeakable cruelty horrors and torture a monument to mans inhumanity to man one saw with great anguish the narrow low slits of ratinfested cells into which had been crushed and jammed endless numbers of captured africans the only egress was the rockbound coast of the atlantic ocean goree the aching womb of africa had spawned and then had spewed out one of the great evils of the modern world yet selfinduced pride in the survival of the fittest or an inoculation of the soul against adversity was bom there and though it is caustic and bitter to be a thing apart it is good therapy to use the hurts the threats the insults sweet are the uses of adversity negroes in order to survive have had to use their adversities as a means of becoming stronger than more flexible than and often more understanding than their oppressors one fine day when all sick people become well it will no long er be necessary to communicate the message of negritude because everyone in the land of the free will have learned the language of the soul for the man or woman

enjoyable reading pioneer negro historians by john hope franklin very generation writes its own history any nationor any peopleis as sensitive about its past as it is about its future nothing reflects so much the way it will approach the future as does the way of looking at the past the changes that each generation experiences provide new ways of looking at the past nothing better illustrates the way that experience guides the writing of history than the manner in which the history of the negro has been viewed and written during the slave period when the great majority of white americans regarded slavery as the natural and desirable lot of the negro those who wrote about the negro assumed that he had no history in this country that was worth mentioning when the negro was mentioned at all the statements were as likely as not to be inaccurate or simply not true such historians invariably white usually treated the negro with a silence that was itself eloquent in its assumption that the negro had no history even their discussion of slavery was viewed not as a part of the negros history but as a part of the labor system of the white man and it was full of errors the early histories tell of the arrival of the first slaves in but the record shows that the twenty negroes who landed in jamestown in were not slaves but were indentured servants many of whom were virginia freeholders within a few years these historians make no mention at all of the stern resistance that negroes put up against slavery all during the colonial period or of the thousands who served in the continental armyafter george washington finally permitted them to enlist during the american revolution not only did the white historians assume that the negro had no history worth noting but also that there were no negroes who could possibly argue otherwise it came as something of a shock therefore to discovereven during the period of slaverythat there were negroes who began to write the history of their people one of these was james w c pennington a runaway slave who after he was twentyone years of age learned to read and write he became so distinguished in latin greek german and theology that the university of heidelberg germany recognized his achievements by conferring on him the honorary degree of doctor of divinity pennington did not write a great book he could hardly have been expected to do so but with the appearance in of his work a text book of the origin and history of the colored people one can say that negro history was launched its significance lies in the fact that it appeared at a time when white americans were giving serious attention to the history of their country but no white historiannot even the great george bancroftgave more than slight attention to the almost three million negroes that constituted sixteen per cent of the population at that time when the slavery controversy was at its heightin the decade before the civil warone of the most widely used arguments supporting slavery was that negroes were so inferior that they had contributed nothing to the development of the country william c nell a bostonbom free negro was outraged by such fallacies and was determined to set the record straight in after years of labor he published his work entitled the services of colored americans in the wars of and in a revised and enlarged edition appeared nell reminded americans of the role that the fugitive slave crispus attucks played in the socalled boston massacre he told of peter salem and salem poor two brave negroes at bunker hill and he had much to say about the other negroes who fought in the american revolution it was about this time that martin r delany a graduate of the harvard medical school turned from his professional duties long enough to write a work that surveyed the history of the negro since his arrival in the new world and described the condition of negroes at the time of the writing negroes were taking to the writing of history and biography in increasing numbers after frederick douglass narrative of his life appeared in other runaway slaves wrote of their own experiences the world learned much of the history of american negro slavery from the pens of the black participants it was a strange thing wonder of wonders that even after the civil war the white historians memory was incredibly short when he discussed matters touching on the history of the negro thus one wrote the following in a book that was widely read in the years after world war the american negroes are the only people in the history of the world who ever became free without any effort of their own they had not started the civil war nor ended it they twanged banjos around railroad stations sang melodious spirituals and believed that some yankee would soon come along and give each of them forty acres and a mule the writer ignored of course the continuous and systematic resistance to slavery in which many slaves were involved even more important he ignored the categorical statement of president lincoln that the use of negro troops of themconstituted the heaviest blow yet dealt the rebellion small wonder that negroes began to give more attention to their history in the years after the civil war negroes saw their position being attacked not only by the ku klux klan and similar terrorists but also by those who were chronicling the events of civil war and reconstruction they knew that they had no chance of getting their story into the works of the widely read white historians of the period and that is one good reason why they began in earnest to write their own history william wells brown already a distinguished novelist and dramatist with a heroic past as a leading negro abolitionist turned to the writing of history his principal work in history was the rising son which appeared in he pointed out the difficulty of securing authentic materials but he asserted that he had throughout endeavored to give a faithful account of their people and their customs without concealing their faults brown was merely the first of a considerable number of negroes who in the reconstruction and postreconstruction years wrote about the history of their people there were william still who wrote the underground railroad an exciting account of an activity in which the author had participated and joseph t wilson a veteran of the civil war who told of the exploits of negro soldiers in a book with the colorful title the black phalanx the most outstanding member of the group and indeed the most important negro historian of the nineteenth century was george washington williams although a young man of thirty when he began writing his monumental history of the negro race in america williams had seen a great deal he had served in the united states army during the civil war had graduated from a theological seminary had studied law and passed the ohio bar and had become the first negro to be elected to the ohio legislature i became convinced williams said that a history of the colored people in america was required because such a history would give the world more correct ideas about the colored people and incite the latter to greater efforts in the struggle of citizenship and manhood when his twovolume work appeared in it was immediately recognized as the most ambitious work ever undertaken by an american negro williams took nearly a thousand pages to tell the story and the very size of the work astounded americans who had thought that the history of the negro could be told in a page or two within a few years williams was hard at work on his history of the negro troops in the rebellion which appeared in he did exhaustive research in all the records then available and he produced a work that left no doubt in the minds of any who were willing to read it that lincolns praise of the negro troops was fully justified williams was writing during those postreconstruction years when the status of the negro in the united states was steadily deteriorating in the year that his history of the negro people appeared the united states supreme court declared unconstitutional the civil_rights act of three years after his book on negro soldiers appeared the mississippi constitutional convention wrote into its organic law suffrage provisions that effectively disfranchised negroes soon south carolina louisiana north carolina and the other southern states followed in the supreme court gave its blessing to the doctrine of separate but equal meanwhile an incredible number of white americansintellectuals literary figures public servantswere engaged in a fullscale attempt to justify segregation and discrimination by arguing that the negro was totally unfit for citizenship as professor rayford logan has shown in his book the betrayal of the negro the most respectable and respected journals described negroes as superstitious stupid imitative ignorant happygolucky improvident lazy immoral and criminal in the face of such studied insults and such deliberate efforts to keep negroes in their place what were negroes to do during the s and s they despaired as much from the libels against them as they did from the laws that segregated them but they were not daunted they fought segregation and discrimination in the courts and in the legislatures they fought the libels with words as well as deeds negroes argued in a veritable flood of books that they were entitled to their rights because through the years they had earned them w h crogman of clark college deserted his classical studies to write a volume entitled the progress of a race he sought almost desperately to prove by an enormous array of facts that negroes had contributed mightily to american life a few years later john w cromwell would attempt to do the same in the negro in american history there were others the best known of whom is booker t washington whose twovolume work the story of the negro appeared in some of those pioneers wrought well others fell short of the mark few of them had either the intellectual equipment or the training of w e b du bois whose first historical work the suppression of the african slave trade was published in as the first volume of the harvard historical studies few of them had the imagination or zeal of carter g woodson who founded the association for the study of negro life and history in and negro history week a decade later each of them in his own way was seeking to fill a great void in the history of the united states e a johnson the school teacher in raleigh north carolina who later was a member of the new york legislature summed up most adequately what the pioneer negro historian was trying to do in the preface to his a school history of the negro race in america published in johnson said during my experience of eleven years as a teacher i have often felt that the children of the race ought to study some work that would give them a little information on the many brave deeds and noble characters of their own race i have often observed the sin of omission and commission on the part of white authors most of whom seem to have written exclusively for white children and studiously left out the many creditable deeds of the negro how must the little colored child feet when he has completed the assigned course of u s history and in it found not one word of credit not one word of favorable comment for even one among the millions of his foreparents who have lived through nearly three centuries of his countrys history the penningtons the johnsons and all the other pioneer negro historians clearly saw what their task was in performing their task they launched an entirely new field of study which has only recently come into its own one of the most cruel things that one could do today would be to forget or ignore pioneers such as these early negro historians one of the most praiseworthy things one could do would be to recognize the enormous importance of their keeping the light of truth flickering until it could be kindled by greater resources and many more hands by irvin h lee eneral nathaniel p banks commander department of the gulf said in referring to their combat behavior it gives me great pleasure to report that they answered every expectation their conduct was heroic no troops could be more determined or more daring banks a union officer who led his forces victoriously at shenandoah valley new orleans and mobile bay was referring to the gallantry and martyrdom of his negro troops of their bravery at millikens bend captain matthew m miller company i commander of the ninth louisiana infantry said so they fought and died defending the cause that we revere they met death coolly bravely nor rashly did they expose themselves but all were steady and obedient to orders such were some of the praises bestowed upon negro soldiers and sailors who fought in the civil war and they not only fought they fought gallantly sometimes displaying a sheer heroism which when looked upon by the nation in whose name the conflict was called forth naturally caused that nation to seek an unprecedented means of rewarding them that reward was the medal of honor presented to twenty black patriots who distinguished themselves by their courage in action and other soldierlike qualities during the war between the states someone has said he who possesses the medal of honor is the holder of the highest military award for bravery that can be given to any individual in the united states of america this symbol of bronze bestows upon the man who has received it a great privilegethat of sharing in the company of the few heroes who have been honored by the award of the same medal he wears there were negroes who served in the union army and on union ships during the civil war most were contrabands or slaves who escaped from their masters to the union lines general benjamin f butler made the first effort to deal with them at fort monroe in he and later general ulysses s grant used the blacks to build roads and fortifications this discriminate use of valuable manpower caused considerable controversy in the north for more than a year the union debated whether the contrabands should be armed and mustered into the army the confederates were already using negroes in their armies louisiana for example had organized the louisiana native guard later known as the first regiment infantry corps dafrique tennessee and south carolina also used negro regiments in the field this prompted certain leaders in the north mayors governors and the like to increase their demands for the employment of negroes as union soldiers in august black units were organized in rhode island kansas and massachusetts by the time president lincolns emancipation proclamation was issued on september nearly negroes were trained and ready for the smoke and din of skirmish and battle along the mississippi the louisiana native guard was the first negro regiment to serve in the union army the blacks were volunteers who fought with the confederates but were treated badly by their white officers to escape this humiliation the negro troops allowed themselves to be cut off by union forces and gladly surrendered general butler then pressed them into service with his forces many of the exslaves eventually found themselves fighting their former masters in a matter of months so many troops had been recruited that on may a bureau of colored troops headed by adjutant general lorenzo thomas was established in washington d c to handle affairs of the negro units negro soldiers trained and fought on a segregated basis and were not treated as the white infantrymen they experienced discrimination and disadvantages the negro for example received seven dollars a month but whites received thirteen because of this discrimination many of the negro combatants became restive sullen and even insubordinate yet the majority of blacks were less interested in the fact of being treated differently than having the right to fight as free men and prove their courage and devotion perhaps sergeant major christian a fleetwood a medal of honor winner best exemplified the negroes motivation when he said he enlisted to save the country from ruin fleetwood served with the fourth u s colored troops in action at yorktown petersburg new market heights and fort fisher sergeant william h carney of the th massachusetts colored infantry was the first negro of the civil war to earn the medal of honor it was at fort wagner south carolina a point vital to the capture of charleston south carolina that he and his fellow patriots bore one of their severest tests of valor it was july the weather was perfect union land batteries opened cannon fire from the southside and were joined simultaneously by six ironclads at the same time the negroes began their charge as they felt their way up the steep jagged face of the fort a barrage of hand grenades exploded about them the negroes advanced upward ignoring death a dozen fell simultaneously dead or wounded among them was the color sergeant carrying the national flag before the colors slipped from the relaxing fingers of the wounded bearer sergeant carney sprang forward and seized them in spite of wounds in his legs breast and right arm he led the way to the enemy fortification and raised the colors for half an hour carney lay on the forts outer slope for protection when the union troops were forced to retreat under heavy fire he retrieved the flag when general grant left the west to take command of the union army and direct the fighting on the crucial virginia front he insisted on bringing negro infantrymen at deep bottom virginia on july four black regiments the sixth u s colored troops among them fought heroically in one of the fiercest campaigns of the battle for virginia the negro volunteers bore the enemy assault gallantly especially sergeant major thomas hawkins he earned a medal of honor for rescuing the regimental flag during the engagement of the action in which about blacks died major general d b birney th corps commander said it was one of the most staring and gallant affairs i have ever known sergeant decatur dorsey also earned his medal for saving the colors at petersburg virginia on july faced by musketry fire in front and a cross fire of shells from the flanks the negro troops charged toward enemy lines some stopping briefly to fire their weapons others taking cover in pits as originally planned dorsey a member of the th u s colored troops surged forward and mounted his colors in confederate territory in advance of his regiment when the unit was driven back to union lines he carried the flags there then bravely rallied the men later the blacks moved over the rebel defenses and engaged the enemy in close combat taking two stands of colors and prisoners for the only union success of the day while the negro soldier was proving his courage the negro seaman was going ahead in his service to the country most of the union navys negro sailors were contrabands because there were not enough white men available in the north exslave robert blake was decorated with the navy medal of honor for valiant service as a powder boy aboard the u s steam gunboat marblehead on december during an engagement with the confederates that christmas day off legareville stono river on johns island seaman blake bravely defended his ship while manning the rifle gun his repeated counterattacks forced the enemy to abandon the island position leaving the caisson and one gun behind of his service blakes commanding officer said he excited my admiration by the cool and brave manner in which he served nearly six months later on june the uss kearsarge had a daring encounter with the confederate raider alabama off cherbourg france aboard the union gunboat were fifteen negro enlisted men of various ratings among them was seaman joachim pease loader of the no gun during the bitter engagement which resulted in the sinking of the alabama pease earned a navy medal of honor for his marked coolness good conduct and gallantry in the action acting ships master david h sumner in reporting on peases actions said he fully sustained his reputation as one of the best men on the ship later john lawson a landsman served aboard the flagship u s s hartford during a skirmish between rebel gunboats and the ram tennessee in mobile bay on august from the vessels mainstep rear admiral david d farragut directed the union attacks against fort morgan the onetime refugee slave camp lawson suffering from a severe leg wound was thrown violently against the side of the ship when an enemy shell exploded the shell burst in the midst of the sixman crew knocking them to the shell whip floor on the berth deck as soon as lawson regained his composure he returned to his battle station despite repeated pleas from captain percival drayton and others to go below for medical treatment he remained at his post until crewmen of the tennessee had run up the white flag in surrender landsman aaron anderson received the medal for service aboard the u s s wyandank during a boat expedition on march participating with a boat crew in the clearing of mattox creek anderson carried out his duties in spite of devastating enemy fire which destroyed half the oars pierced the launch in places and cut the barrel off a musket being fired at the enemy negroes earned eleven medals of honor for valiantly and effectively serving with the union army during campaigns at chapins farm virginia on september private william h barnes of the th u s colored troops although wounded was among the first of his unit to enter rebel territory and rally the union forces during one engagement his medal was awarded on april for that demonstration of bravery sergeant major fleetwood first sergeant alexander kelly sergeant alfred b hilton and private charles veal were decorated for rescuing the colors during separate encounters with the confederates at chaffins farm fleetwood a member of the fourth u s colored troops seized the colors after two bearers had been shot and carried them nobly during the fight fleetwoods unit lost about out of less than men during the battle relating his fellow infantrymens courage he later said the negro stood in the full glare of the greatest armies ever mustered upon this continent competing sidebyside with the bravest and best of lees army losing nothing by comparison when the regimental color bearer fell during another attack at chaffins farm sergeant hilton of the fourth seized the color together with the national standard he then led the charge on enemy lines until he was wounded by rebel fire in an advance near confederate barricades in another charge the colors had fallen first sergeant kelly seized the flag then rallied the men of the sixth u s colored troops amidst confusion and heavy enemy resistance when two other color bearers were shot in another skirmish close to enemy territory private veal seized the national flag then without concern for his own safety he led the fourth u s colored troops through the most dangerous areas of battle though most of the negro units were commanded by whites there were seventyfive negro officers including eight physicians serving in the civil war yet there was no possibility of advancement for enlisted men into the ranks of commissioned officers this fact however did not mean the blacks did not possess leadership qualities they did and it was pointed out at chaffins farm there were cases of enlisted men gallantly leading their men after commanding officers were killed five of these sergeants received medals of honor for such valor on september one was first sergeant powhatan beaty fifth u s colored troops he took command of company g and gallantly led the men when all the officers were killed or wounded first sergeant james h bronson did the same with the fifths company d as did sergeant major milton m holland with c company and first sergeant robert pinn of company i fifth u s colored troops first sergeant edward ratcliff th u s colored troops took command of company c after the commanding officer had been killed he then gallantly led his men and was the first to enter enemy territory while the battle was raging at chaffins farm on september the blacks were adding to their laurels at nearby new market heights the key to the rebel flank on the north side of the james river the negroes had advanced at the gray of dawn and forged up the slope surrounding fort harrison the axeman hacked at a barricade made of heavy brush to clear the way when the last enemy fortress was reached the rebels fled under heavy fire without waiting for the union soldiers bayonet charge sergeant james h harris who earned a medal of honor for bravery in the assault and the th swept over the fort and conquered new market road the enemys stronghold five hundred fortythree negroes lay lifeless in a space yards long after the advance back at chaffins farm the following day september corporal miles james exemplified the negroes courage as the battle for the farm continued james took his position within thirty yards of enemy territory rebel fire mutilated one of his arms yet he loaded and fired his weapon with one hand in spite of continuous pleas to have the shattered arm treated he urged the men of the th u s colored troops to press the assault near the end of the war colonel thomas wentworth higginson heroic commander of the rd noted no officer in the regiment now doubts that the key to the successful prosecution of this war lies in the unlimited employment of black troops instead of leaving their homes and families to fight they are fighting for their homes and families and they show that resolution and sagacity which a personal purpose gives it would have been madness to attempt with the bravest white troops what i have successfully accomplished with the black ones and so it was with the emancipated negro in war between the states twenty of them won the medal of honorthe nations most coveted military decoration of the medal of honor winners who in over years pushed their devotion to their country beyond the call of the possible the negro was among them they earned most of their medals while risking death to save a nation which had enslaved them the man who saved washington dc by c l lewis of tourists eager for firsthand iwl knowledge of america s patriotic history flock to washington dc each year they tour the endless monuments and marvel at the unique design of the nations capital yet few realize that without the contribution of benjamin banneker an th century negro native of baltimore county maryland the city might not exist its famous location simply a muddy undeveloped tract on the banks of the mighty potomac the winning of independence had brought a sense of heady jubilation to the new nation a collective symbol of the nations pride at gaining freedom was needed it was nationally agreed that the construction of a permanent capital was the answer selection of the site was another matter competition was keen among cities that wished to be the new home of government activity philadelphia boasted that it had been the seat of the continental congress the first shot for independence had been fired in boston freedom was actually won at yorktown annapolis wilmington trentoneach had a good reason why it should be chosen as the capital of the united states george washington favored a section along the potomac river not far from his mount vernon home on july congress passed the resident act giving the president authority to choose a mile square territory on the potomac virginia and maryland contributed land to the undertaking george washington appointed thomas johnson daniel carroll and david stuart landowners of importance in the region commissioners of the district it was agreed that the federal district should be designated the territory of columbia and the federal city the city of washington pierre charles lenfant who had fought side by side with george washington in the revolution been wounded at savannah taken prisoner at charleston and suffered the miseries of valley forge expressed a desire to participate in the project washington appointed him to draw the plans for the new capital lenfant was hot tempered and arrogant from the very beginning a struggle for authority developed it was a rainy spring the entire district was a mass of mud yet despite the adverse conditions land speculation reached a fever pitch everyone wanted to see the map that lenfant was working on but the frenchman refused to reveal even the slightest detail charges of selfish interests were thrown at him lenfant collected all papers concerning the proposed construction and with three surveyors among them benjamin banneker he continued to work alone finally in a fit of anger over failing to obtain extra funds for the project the architect left the country taking with him the only available set of plans it was a grieved thomas jefferson then secretary of state who summoned workers on the project to the temporary capital in philadelphia to seek a solution to the crisis he feared that a completely new beginning would have to be made not even he had seen the plans when asked for suggestions the group was shocked to see benjamin banneker stand and ask if lenfants plans had been satisfactory jefferson stated that he had never seen the plans then asked the reason for this odd question i have the plans in my head said banneker his photographic memory had retained the intricate details of the drawings redraw the plans as soon as performable jefferson ordered banneker returning to his home near ellicott mills maryland completed the nearimpossible task in three days major andrew ellicott was named to succeed lenfant as chief architectural planner banneker was chosen his chief assistant banneker was born a free landowner legend relates that his grandmother was an english dairy maid sent to america after being wrongfully convicted of theft his grandfather the first bannka son of a powerful african chief was sold into slavery by arab traders this remarkable man had little formal schooling yet rose to prominence in several fields including farming astronomy and editorship of a widelyacclaimed almanac at the age of with knowledge gained from taking apart a watch he perfected the first clock in maryland possibly in america in later years banneker spent long periods observing the joys of his life the stars and the farmlands he had known since childhood on october he died while sitting beneath a tree atop a hill overlooking the fields near his home the federal gazette and baltimore daily advertiser october reported on sunday the th instant departed this life near his residence in baltimore county mr benjamin banneker a black man immediate descendant of an african father he was well known in this neighborhood for his quiet and peaceful demeanor and among scientific men as an astronomer and mathematician newer negro history by benjamin quarles the title new er negro history a reader may ask himself isnt the past like it always was the answer as he already knows is that the past does not cannot changeas omar the tentmaker reminds us the moving finger writes and having writ moves on nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line nor all your tears wash out a word of it but what does change is our understanding of the past our interpretation of it men are always seeking a more meaningful recovery of the past a proper study of history has much to be said for it including its possible influence on the shape of things to come to make the future said carter g woodson the father of negro history it is necessary to remake the past fortunately in the years since woodson lit the torch many other writers have been throwing fresh light on the negro in our history like other aspects of our national life history is now being desegregated old outlooks giving way to new these revisionist viewpoints are numerous this is to be expected inasmuch as the negros roots sink deeply into the american past a brief description of a few of these better known reassessments might serve to suggest their scope and variety no other aspect of negro history is undergoing such a reappraisal as the african background particularly the west coast bulge that comprised the ancestral homelands of the american negro until the recent discovery of historical africa the notion prevailed that when the europeans ventured down the west coast beginning with the portuguese in the s they found the natives living in primitive barbarism and savagery until recent years most people have thought of tropical africa as having been outside the paleits peoples having fallen behind in the march of civilization its cultures as having been static it followed therefore that when the african was brought to the new world he was little more than a brute the belief that black africa has no history had a twofold origin with the coming of the european powers the west coast kingdoms passed into a state of colonialism their histories were not taught indeed it was assumed that no such history existed it being a cardinal premise of colonial rule that the history of the subject people dates from the arrival of the conquerors moreover once determined to exploit africas human resources the europeans men of religion and conscience had to convince themselves of the innate inferiority of the natives and the worthlessness of their traditions to slave traders and outsiders in general it was comforting to believe that africans were the most backward of all the peoples making up the human family today these outmoded viewpoints of the african past are on the run the work of routing them owes something to the pioneering efforts of w e b dubois who in the s praised africa as the negros greater fatherland from the beginning of a long career as a scholar at his desk and a crusader in the public arena dubois correctly sensed the existence of much scientific knowledge of africa which has never been brought together in while teaching at atlanta university he made his first attempt to launch an encyclopedia africana an effort he was to undertake for the third time in then upon the invitation of kwame nkrumah president of ghana dubois was not destined to complete his dream of an encyclopedia he died in at the age of but he had left his mark on african scholarship perhaps his most notable disciple was william leo hansberry whose life was changed after reading one of duboiss books the negro published in this slim volume was like a new planet swimming into hansberrys ken its two hundred and fortytwo pages he wrote were packed with innumerable facts not only about ancient kush and old aethiopia but about a whole series of kingdoms and empires which had flourished elsewhere in black africa in historical antiquity and in the middle ages but of which up to that time i had never read or heard a single word in duboiss pages hansberry read of kingdoms and cultures that as he noted were already hoary with age when hellas was still an infant and rome was yet unborn determined to read the books on africa mentioned by dubois young hansberry went to harvard university which dubois had attended during the cambridge years hansberry immersed himself in the study of the powerful and farranging kingdoms and empires of the west coast in subsequent years he reenforced his knowledge by study at the oriental institute of the university of chicago and by archeological field trips in nine african countries hansberry shared his findings with others both in the classroom as professor of early african history at howard university and through the printed page he is esteemed in the continent whose history he has helped to resurrect in his honor the university of nigeria has established the hansberry college of african studies in the government of ethiopia named hansberry as the initial recipient of the haile selassie i african research award he died in november not having quite completed his crowning work a comprehensive history of the lands he loved so well the pioneering work of dubois and hansberry in the rediscovery of the african past was reenforced by that of white scholars foremost among these was melville j herskovits whose myth of the negro past published in was a landmark in african studies herskovits set out to demolish the argument that the ancestor of the american had been culturally naked when he came to the new world on the contrary said herskovits the negroes of west africa had developed a complex civilization one that embraced advanced political systems operating under codes of law a well organized economic life which in many cases included the use of money and a deeply ingrained artistic urge which was manifest in a profusion so diverse as to include the use of a wide variety of musical instruments an ear for the subtlest rhythm the production of imaginative art in woodcarving bronze and ironwork an evident skill in clothweaving and basketry and a literary impulse that found outlet in tales proverbs and riddles following the lead of herskovits a number of other white researchers turned their attention to the african past in a group of such scholars organized the african studies association in another group one of predominantly english membership founded the journal of african history by the early s african history had emerged from obscurity into acceptance as a recognized field of historical study writes philip d curtin in his excellent booklet african history another authority robert i rotberg of harvard in his scholarly book a political history of tropical africa points out that the existence of african history has in recent years achieved widespread recognition many universities in america and europe now offer general and specialized courses in the subject at several levels news media are similarly aware of its respectability the recent wave of interest in the african way of life past and present has been furthered by the american society of african culture a negro organization founded in as stated by its president john a davis its purpose is twofold to inform america about the great contribution africans and people of african descent have made to the world of music dance sculpture and painting and to give to the american negro a pride in his originshis heritage across the atlantic and finally on this point african history is destined to become better known because of the work of africans themselves the new ly independent nations of tropical africa are now busy recreating their own pasts the scholars in their new colleges and univeristies will help lay the myth that the peoples of africa were backward and uncivilized before the penetration of the europeans the emergence of african history will do more it should be added than to restore some early missing pages to negro american history african history will prove an antidote to the longstanding neglect of nonwestern cultures it will make necessary a revision of the traditional sequence in studying history a sequence which begins with the fertile crescent and then proceeds successively to greece rome and europe winding up in the united states just as the african background is undergoing restudy so too is another phase of history that had until recently been put to use as a proof of negro inferioritythe reconstruction period this was the tenyear span right after the civil war a period in which negroes sat in congress and in the legislatures of the southern states according to older traditional viewpoints these negro legislators were extravagant corrupt illiterate and incompetent willing pawns in the hands of scheming white politicians this period of republicannegro rule in the south has indeed been difficult to assess accurately the reason lies in the fact that the sources on which the historian must depend are so often shot through with bitter partisanship most of the historians who lived in the america that emerged out of appomattox behaved as though the civil war was a continuing war many northern writers still viewing the former confederates as unreconstructed rebels and most southern writers defending their antebellum viewpoints and thinking of the war as a lost cause which deserved a better fate such onesided views have often been accepted by later generations of writers including historians of note the role of the negro in reconstruction has long needed a saner review until recently many of the standard works on the period have been written by men who believed that the negro was innately inferior a belief which militated against sound judgment being in essence a nineteenth century white south point of view fortunately more and more we are getting a more balanced picture of the negros role in reconstruction the period itself is now being viewed as a time of experimentation rather than as a dreadful decade reconstruction legislatures are now being credited with many important reforms such as establishing free public school systems and making it possible for people without property to vote and hold office the negros participation in politics is now no longer viewed as disastrous the majority of negroes who sat in the state legislatures were honest public servants men who have a genuine interest and a genuine earnestness in the business of the assembly as eyewitness james s pike wrote concerning the ninetyfour negroes who sat in the south carolina legislature similarly the socalled carpetbaggers the whites who were allied with negroes during reconstruction are now being viewed more favorably these carpetbaggers have generally carried a bad name originally given to them by those who disliked equality for the negro what better way to discredit negro voting than by attacking its supporters and so carpetbaggers were charged with being adventurers whose only interest was in making a fast dollar at the expense of the stricken south recent scholarship however has made it more and more apparent that many carpetbaggers school teachers ministers businessmen and public officialswere people of good will who were anxious to build a better south for white and black alike the old stereotype of the dishonest yankee carpetbagger has been challenged again in otto h olsens recent biography of albion w tourgee able judge of the north carolina superior court and author of a fools errand a novel of reconciliation the two decades following reconstruction were low points for the negro who had been shorn of the ballot and whose civil_rights had been whittled down by supreme court decisions but oddly enough it was not until the turn of the century that segregation laws took a sharp rise c vann woodward in his book strange career of jim crow points out that most of the segregation statutes of the south dated not from the s as might be expected but rather from the late s this was the case in many southern communities mary white ovington writing of her visit to atlanta in spoke of the refusal of dr william h crogman of clark to accept the new city statute that demanded segregation he would not enter an atlanta street car at first he had a horse and buggy but when the college could no longer afford this he walked and it was no short walk to the city woodward shows that the souths racial practices were shaped by segregation statutes he thus refutes anew the argument that the law is powerless to change attitudes and behavior in the field of race relations and that any desirable change must be brought about through the efforts of voluntary groups and agencies exercising patient understanding and using the techniques of friendly persuasion those who assert that legal measures are not the answer to problems of racial adjustment would be amazed to discover the extent to which such legal measures have been used to fix and delimit the status of the negro throughout our countrys history the newer negro history has many aspects but their central theme and their total impact may be summed up in the phrase the negro belongs in a historical sense of course the negro has never completely escaped the attention of the historical guild but generally he has been thought of as a source of labor or as a source of problems he has been viewed as among us yet not of us an enclave in the body politic but the overwhelming majority of negroes have never thought of themselves as aliens as a separatist group frederick douglass the most prominent negro of the nineteenth century asserted that it was better to be a part of the whole than to be the whole of a part we are americans he wrote and as americans we would speak to americans gunner myrdal has termed the negro an exaggerated american in the sense that his americanism does not stop at per cent indeed it has been because of this sentiment that negroes have been so critical of their country and so discontented with some of its practices because of their americanism negroes have taken the declaration of independence at its face value because of their americanism negroes have measured their living standards and their opportunities in terms of the american experience not by the yardstick of some other lands or some other peoples this identificationwithamerica sentiment is not hard to explain the negros roots are deep in our history here before the mayflower he is in truth an old american as such he has been a contributor to the making of america he came with the earliest discoverers and explorers negroes provided as much of the heritage of the american continent as any other group writes anthropologist paul bohannan the economy of the antebellum south its production of tobacco sugar rice and cotton rested on negro labor the negro fought in all of americas wars he took part in the westward movement a story only now becoming known negroes were on every mining frontier from california in to the end of the gold rush in the black hills of dakota writes w sherman savage the negro has consistently stood for democracy and equality the extension of civil liberties in our land owes much to him the cultural patterns he brought from his ancestral homelands have left their design on the broad american fabric the south has unconsciously absorbed the gift of his folktemperament his humor sentiment and imagination wrote a a schomburg the negro bibliophile similarly in the negro in american culture margaret just butcher points out and proceeds to prove that some of the most characteristic features of american culture are derivatives of the folk life and spirit of this darker tenth of the population as colored americans come to know something of the newer updated negro history they can better appreciate their long and close identification with the land of their birth but almost paradoxically in the process of learning this lesson they have also become aware of their own uniqueness today the informed negro no longer denies his past or his color for he is aware of the pluralistic manysided nature of his countrys culture america is woven of many strands writes ralph ellison in the invisible man our fate is to become one and yet many this is not prophecy but description remembering denmark vesey by sterling stuckey n a slave named denmark vesey won a lottery and purchased his freedom from his master twentytwo years later in charleston south carolina he was arrested interrogated and sent to the gallows for having led a conspiracy against slavery involving thousands of slaves inspired by the vesey example black abolitionists used it on a number of occasions to exhort the slaves to sunder their bonds henry highland garnett in an address in at buffalo new york called for a rebellion on the part of slaves reminding them that denmark vesey had shaken the whole empire of slavery later during the civil war frederick douglass urged the slaves to take up arms to remember denmark vesey of charleston moreover civil_rights partisans invoked the spirit of vesey on numerous occasions in the latter part of the th century to strengthen the will of their followers in face of fierce overwhelming odds since the death of vesey chroniclers of the slave era have referred to his conspiracy as one of the most extensive and ingeniously planned of all slave plots and its validity has been attested by contemporaries and historians alike indeed there was general agreement on the existence of a fullscale plot by vesey until richard c wade of the university of chicago raised serious questions regarding the entire incident and called for reconsideration professor wade has advanced the view that there is persuasive evidence that no conspiracy in fact existed that at the most it was a vague and unformulated plan in the minds or on the tongues of a few colored townsmen wade in a recently published book slavery in the cities again challenged the veracity of the usual historical accounts of the conspiracy asserting that the plot was probably never more than loose talk by aggrieved and embittered men some of the details concerning the events which threw the city of charleston into a state of great unrest during the summer of are likely to remain forever clothed in obscurity nevertheless a reconstruction of the broad outline of developments which caused the defenders of slavery to seek certain retribution against scores of slaves is possible by recounting those developments as viewed for more than a century by those who have studied the vesey incident we hope to provide a historical screen against which wades charges can be projected for purposes of more meaningful scrutiny on may devany the slave of john c prioleau was standing alongside the fitzsimmons fish wharf in charleston gazing out to sea he was accosted by william paul the slave of messrs j and d paul the pauls slave drew devany into conversation asking him if he knew that something serious was about to happen devany answering that he did not was told that the slaves were determined to do something about their condition to rise up against slavery in great numbers in order to right themselves devany frightened by this startling disclosure carried the intelligence to his master which precipitated the arrest of paul other slaves peter poyas and mingo harthwere later implicated by paul who had begun to fear for his life but poyas and harth displayed such coolness when questioned that they were released william paul however was placed in solitary confinement within a week he divulged more names stated that the plot was one of extensive proportions and that its object was the massacre of whites but at least one of the men ned bennett immediately came forth of his own volition and asked to be questioned if he was suspected a move which served to perplex the authorities more than ever especially since bennett was the governors slave vesey was not idle while these proceedings were taking place upon the arrest of peter poyas john lofton has written veseyfearing that the plan would be frustrated if its execution were delayed until july as originally scheduledhad advanced the date to june meanwhile a white resident of charleston major john wilson having heard about the plot enlisted the aid of one of his mothers slaves a blacksmith prominent in negro church affairs george wilson on friday june startling information was revealed to the blacksmith by a member of his church class he was told that not a moment should be lost informing the authorities since the outbreak was scheduled to begin at midnight on sunday june george wilson dutifully reported this information to the major notified of this new development the authorities moved with dispatch governor thomas bennett began to shore up the military resources of the city by ordering the quartermaster general of militia to place in the citys arsenal ball cartridges and to prepare muskets for delivery john hope franklin referring to the state of panic toward which charleston was moving at this time has observed all kinds of military groups were called into service a person unfamiliar with the problem doubtless would have thought that such extentive mobilization was for the purpose of meeting some foreign foe the neck rangers the charleston riflemen the light infantry and the corps of hussars were some of the established military groups called up a special city guard of one hundred and fifty troops was provided for charleston only the authorities and those involved in the plot knew that a rebellion was scheduled to take place within two days the whole was concealed said the governor until the time came but secret preparations were made saturday night and sunday morning passed without demonstrations doubts were excited and counter orders were issued for diminishing the guard due to the unusual activity among the militia it was borne in upon vesey and his coconspirators that the defenders of slavery had been forewarned that theyvesey and his followerscould no longer expect to avail themselves of the element of surprise though twenty or thirty of his country followers reached the city on sunday morning june vesey still clinging to the hope that he could lead them in an uprising ordered them to disperse and wait for further orders as if to reinforce his leaders hope bacchus the slave of benjamin hamet brought to veseys houseon sunday nighta sword as well as a pistol which he had stolen from his master rumors of the projected uprising had by this time already reached the citizenry as lofton stated in his book there was great excitement among the whites that evening the streets were filled until a late hour with persons who were uncertain whether it was safe to retire even children were allowed to remain up at the appointed hour of p m the extra military units took up their stations although their size had been ordered reduced somewhat as a result of the noticeable lack of activity among the slaves a night of sleepless anxiety in the white community followed the sixteenth of june passed on the eighteenth ten suspicious slaves were arrested a development which sounded the plots deathknell for the investigation soon revealed a free negro named denmark vesey as the leader of the enterpriseamong his chief coadjutors being that innocent peter and that unsuspecting mingo who had been examined and discharged nearly three weeks before as quoted from travelers and outlaws as tension mounted vesey who had managed to elude his pursuers for three days was arrested and brought to trial on june the day following his arrest less than two weeks later he and five other negroes were taken to the edge of the city the trap door was sprung and the bodies of the six were left suspended over the gallows wade writes the uprising now seemed quashed but as word of it spread in the city public shock turned into hysteria no master could be sure his bondsmen were not involved whites who owned no slaves had little more assurance every negro became a possible enemy indeed assassin every action by a black could be construed as a prelude to violence since slaves lived in the same yard with their masters it was not even possible to lock out the intruder considering the details of the original plot as disclosed by witnesses as the trials proceeded it is small wonder that passions were roused to the point of hysteria lofton basing his account of the conspirators original plans on the evidence as recorded and believed by the court has described the dark stratagems of vesey and his men some slaves drawn from the countryside as well as the city were simultaneously to march at midnightarmed with pikes daggers swords bayonets scythes and a few pistolsupon the u s arsenal the governors mansion the main guardhouse and a number of other points of the city they were then to fire the city and liquidate not only whites but those blacks who did not join no oneneither children nor women nor ministers of the gospelwould be spared from late june until the th of july over cases were heard by the court the number arrested h m henry has recorded was of whom were convicted the number executed was all slaves except vesey number deported among the leaders brought to trial only onemonday gelladmitted involvement in a conspiracy against slavery the other principals maintained that they were innocent throughout july slaves were being executed on one occasion twentytwo were executed at once left dangling above the long gallows in full view of the populace the relatives of those hanged were not even allowed to bury their dead as the authorities regarded the bodies of slaves even in death as property on request the bodies of the executed men were turned over to surgeons for purposes of dissection according to lofton in insurrection in south carolina the vengeance of the slavocracy with this singular act had all but spent itself though a few more hangings followed in its wake in late summer the cry went up for the banishment of all free negroes from the state the deed had been done it remained for posterity to interpret it the above account of the vesey plot is representative of the views of the great majority of scholars who have described the insurrection indeed until recently the scope and existence of the plot have gone unquestioned even ulrich b phillips who was quick to seize upon the alleged submissive nature of the slave and turn such an attribute against the negros claim to full manhood rights never questioned the existence of the plot asserting that the vesey plot was elaborate phillips further remarks in a chapter entitled slave crimes that the conspiracy is one of the most notable of such episodes on record herbert aptheker characterizes the incident as one of the most serious widespread and carefully planned conspiracies in addition he describes vesey as a master of several languages who couched his appeals to the rights of man in both theological and secular terms louis filler observes that the vesey insurrection horrified southerners by its scope the audacity of its leaders and the close relationship it revealed between slave and free negroes and kenneth stampp refers to veseys vast conspiracy which came to nothing after it was given away by a slave this brings us back to professor wades analysis of the conspiracy which led him to conclude that no such fullscale plot in fact took place that at the most it was a vague unformulated plan in the minds or on the tongues of a few colored townsmenitalics added wades reconsideration of the vesey plot must on any showing be taken seriously for it raises serious questions with regard to all preceding interpretations of the plot wade contends that essential facts about the vesey uprising that have been generally accepted by historians are open to question because historians have relied on an official version published by the city in which provided the only available facts facts which in his view do not square with the original account of the case moreover he argues that a close reading of the two versions will show that the original transcript was doctored and that historians generally have focused on the broader meaning of the conspiracy as it related to resistance of negroes to the institution of slavery wade in questioning the existence of the plot relies to a considerable extent on letters written by a respected judge who raised questions concerning the effects of popular excitement upon the trials and letters written by the daughter of the judge whose mood ranged from frenzy to skepticism from great certitude concerning the enormity of the plot to concern over the lengths to which the court had gone in punishing the accused the daughter ann hayes johnson remarked at one point as quoted by wade that south carolinians were possessed of impetuosity and ardency of feeling which unavoidably lays them open to deception and consequently leads them on to error in action but wade does not assert that either judge johnson or his daughter denied the existence of a plot rather he suggests that they were concerned over procedures followed and punishment exacted alluding to doubts expressed by governor thomas bennett wade challenges the published record of the trial at a number of important points though he admits that the governor probably believed in a plot of some kind wade quotes at length from the governors message given to the senate and house of representatives of the state of south carolina on november pointing out that the governor questioned the secrecy surrounding the trial the method of gathering testimony by the judges the reliability of testimony concerning the nature of the plot the disparity between the enormous scope of the plot and the meager resources of the rebels and the belief that the leaders of the plot were acting in concert in examining the points raised by the governor wade questions the involvement of an alleged conspirators basing his doubt on the fact that no roster of names ever turned up since the plot supposedly involved slaves within a radius of to miles of charleston he remarks that the lack of activity in the rural sections cast doubt on the extensiveness of the conspiracy wade draws attention to ambiguities in the official record with respect to the matter of weapons and makes much of the fact that no cache of arms was found he points out that the confessions of two of the accused were edited in the published version of the trials which served to change the tone of the narrative in the same vein he cites the fact that the published account of the trial includes mention of a rebellion not even referred to in the original transcript in wades opinion the discrepancies seem deliberate since the printed version alleges that no facts would be suppressed and that the very words of the witnesses would be used the burden of wades argument then is that the authenticity of the printed version of the trial is in doubt that it contains enough questionable material to support the view that the object of the trial was not to discover the extent of the plot but rather to awe the negroes by a show of force the very atmosphere itself so charged with tension born of rumors emanating from both sides of the color line was especially congenial to a racial explosion when devany and william paul had their chance encounter on the wharf that day in late may the catalytic agent was introduced thus wade remarks charleston stumbled into tragedy how does wade account for the tenacity of the myth of vesey conspiring to lead thousands of alarms in a assault against the slavocracy opponents and apologists of slavery have since used the vesey incident he informs us as part of the ammunition of their respective arsenals either the incident was used as eloquent proof that the will to freedom is so natural a part of the human personality that none would remain passively enchained or as justification for the stringent laws against negroes during slavery no closer examination of the events of that sultry summer in seemed warranted since scholars were in argreement that the revolt had taken place the vesey uprising had become a convenient illustration of a larger view of bondage richard wade considers it of great moment that the leaders of the insurrection had little or no plan of action and with one exception proclaimed their innocence to the very end one is forced to wonder whether conspirators if involved in an expansive plot can reasonably be expected to admit guilt particularly as long as all of the leaders have not been detected and arrested higginson takes notice of the fact that the transcripts contain an admission on the part of the judges that they were unable to detect more than a small minority of those concerned in the conspiracy could it be that the vesey insurrectionists to the extent that they were successful in mounting a large conspiracy owed their success to iron discipline and to a vow not to reveal important information to the authorities higginson who spent weeks poring over the official reports in charleston offers a different view from that of professor wade as regards both the plan and the refusal of the men who designed it to declare themselves a party to the plot the details of the plan higginson writes were not rashly committed to the mass of the confederates they were known only to a few and were finally to be announced only after the evening prayer meetings on the appointed sunday vesey showed great penetration says lofton and sound judgment in the selection of his leaders the small number convicted in comparison to the number of negroes reported to be involved seems to have been due to a determination on the part of the leaders to meet their fate without talking portions of the official reports not cited by wade perhaps go far toward explaining the refusal of most of the leaders to enter a plea of guilty rolla is described as a man who was remarkable for great presence and composure of mind one who exhibited no signs of fear ned was stern and immovable even when receiving the sentence of death in peters countenance were strongly marked disappointed ambition revenge indignation and an anxiety to know how far the discoveries had extended italics added to quote higginson he is said to have responded with a cryptic smile when asked whether he really wanted to see his kindly master murdered vesey addressed witnesses in an imperious manner and argued his case with great art and plausibility wades charge that the reports fail to mention the discovery of a large cache of arms however must be reckoned with by those historians who assume that the arms had either been fashioned or secured for use higginson takes a different view of governor bennetts attitude toward the court proceedings than that taken by wade who relies heavily on the governors charge of excessive punishment and contends that the governor probably did not take the description of the plot provided by the city very seriously higginson offers the view that the governors attitude was colored by a desire to smooth the thing over for the credit and safety of the city he contrasts the governors evasive tone with the frank and thorough statements of the judges if a few people like the governor doubted the enormity of the plot higginson avers the judges seem to admit that had the whole thing been brought to a head the slaves generally would have joined in lofton seems to support wades position that the governor was motivated by a sincere concern over the harsh punishment which was meted out to the insurrectionists he does point out that the governor was also concerned about securing the release of his own slaves a most curious feature of professor wades piece on the vesey plot is the scanty information provided concerning the dramatis personae italics added despite the fact that considerable information regarding each leader of the insurrection is available wade in the main fails to incorporate this material into his assessment he does not mention for example the fact that vesey though a fairly prosperous artisan had every reason to hate slavery especially since he had fathered many children by slave mothers considering the fact that the children and their mothers were doomed to a lifetime of slavery it is not difficult to conceive of vesey wanting to war against that institution his temper according to the court was impetuous and domineering in the extreme qualifying him for the despotic rule of which he was ambitious at another point the record reveals that many negroes feared him more than their owners and one of them declared even more than god no ordinary man vesey appears to have been a man possessing charismatic authority most historians who have written at length on the vesey insurrection have recounted much on the life of peter poyas who was said to be veseys chief lieutenant but all wade tells us is that poyas had an excellent reputation and the implicit confidence of his master in addition to being a firstrate artisan at no time does wade come to grips with the incident with which many writers have most often identified poyas his exhortation to the slaves to not open your lips die silent as you shall see me do as quoted in john lofton negro insurrectionist antioch review xviii summer higginson reports that poyas was said to have a magnetism in his eye of which his confederates stood in great awe if he once got his eye upon a man there was no resisting it it has also been remarked that poyas when on the gallows repeated his charge of secrecy do not open your lips die silent as you shall see me do on another occasion according to a witness poyas was chained to the floor of his cell with another conspirator when the men in authority came to exhort the names of the men conspiring with the two slaves poyas is said to have leaned upon his elbow looked at the man lying beside him urging quietly die like a man and then lay down again it has been observed that he was obeyed but there is no mention of these remarks in the wade piece other members of the upper echelons of leadership were scarcely less impressive the transcript the original and published versions pay tribute to the abilities and disciplined natures of the men selected by vesey to join in the uprising it should not go unremarked that according to the court vesey and his men had been planning the revolt for close to four years before they were betrayed for a small group of embittered and aggrieved men to have kept such a plan a secret for that length of time appears to be an eloquent testament to their extraordinary conspiratorial propensities such men it seems would not be likely to yield easily to pressure wades charge that not a single roster of names was uncovered stands as one not easily answered given the information provided by his article but when vital portions of the transcript not mentioned by wade are quoted and discussed by lofton higginson and others such as detailed information concerning the personalities and activities of leaders of the plotthen even wades charge regarding the roster of names appears to lose some of its force one might reason bearing in mind what is known about poyas vesey and other prominent figures of the incident that as soon as poyas and mingo harth were released from jail after their first arrest all rosters of names were probably destroyed for at that time all of the leaders were still at large still free to dispose of evidence that would most assuredly not only seal their doom but compromise every member of the plot from the city to the countryside since according to the court each leader kept to himself the names of his proselytes the destruction of rosters of names would indeed be a simple act to perform wade in questioning the extensiveness of the plot says that some of the accused when confronted with each other didnt even appear to know each other perhaps the decision among the leaders to prepare and keep their own rosters explains this in addition such a decision on the part of the leaders might indicate that the plot was a large rather than small one wades contention that the published version of the proceedings of the court varied significantly from the original account seems to be unassailable he and thomas hamilton are evidently the only historians to point out this discrepancy wade demonstrates that evidence in the original transcript was suppressed it should be recalled however that the suppression of information concerning slave revolts in the south was not confined to the vesey case alone according to margaret just butchers the negro in american culture accounts of innumerable slave revolts were suppressed as much as possible but wades position here seems to be well taken for the officials appeared to be suppressing portions of the transcript which might weaken the case for a fair trial having taken place additional information found in the published transcript does seem to clear up as he points out certain questionable features of the original there seems to be little question but that there were irregularities in the manner in which the proceedings of the court were conducted but courts in the south during antebellum days and even now were not noted for protecting the rights of negroes especially when the rights to be protected belonged to men allegedly involved in a conspiracy to overthrow slavery herbert aptheker makes it quite clear that south carolina laws were designed to protect the interests of the masters not the rights of their slaves or former slaves the fundamental principle of all relationships between the slave and society according to antislavery by dumond was that the slave was subject to control but was not entitled to protection italics added thus south carolina was not alone in fashioning laws to govern slaves that were at variance with those used to establish legal relations among whites by not pointing out these characteristic irregularities wade leaves the impression that charleston officials went to extraordinary lengths to frame vesey and those arrested with him which is quite a different thing from being indifferent with regard to the legal rights of the accused it would have been far more instructive had wade placed his discussion of the vesey plot in the broader context of slavery as an institution had he done so it is possibleeven probablethat his case would have been appreciably weakened for just as carolinians were not unique in their handling of slave legal cases neither were they different from others in inflicting upon slaves punishment quite disproportionate to the offense intended or committed the reactions of the proslavery elements in virginia during and following the gabriel and turner revolts certainly were at the very least equal to the harsh behavior of the authorities responsible for the brutal mass hangings of the vesey conspirators according to kenneth stampp it is worth noting as regards the gabriel conspiracy that though there was no question of the guilt of the slaves involved the leaders when arrested behaved in a manner strikingly similar to that of vesey poyas and the other principals of the vesey plot though gabriel and his followers took to the field to battle for their freedom they were willing to reveal little or nothing concerning their plans james monroe then governor of virginia said of gabriel from what he said to me he seemed to have made up his mind to die and to have resolved to say but little on the subject of the conspiracy as quoted by herbert aptheker in american negro slave revolts is it not possible that vesey poyas harth and others associated with vesey were simply using tactics similar to those used by gabriel and his colleagues the authorities as in the vesey case were never able to determine the number of men involved in gabriels conspiracy and there was that same secrecy prior to the revolt among gabriel and his tough band that the authorities have attributed to the men who allegedly conspired to wreck charleston indeed the gabriel plan for revolt was kept with incredible secrecy for quite some time in the view of one high official in virginia given the character of vesey and the men around him especially when considering what happened in virginia in it is not unlikely that they had conceived and long nourished a plan that went beyond the loose talk stage whether innocent or guilty ordinary men would one would think quake at the thought of facing the gallows considering the racial atmosphere of the antebellum south is it not extraordinary that most of the ring leaders in question behaved as they did displaying levity in some instances scorn in others and no fear throughout the proceedings professor wade closes his discussion of the vesey plot with the observation that the men accused of having led a conspiracy in charleston were not likely prospects for such a scheme this conclusion is based on his theory that slaves in cities being better off than imbruted field hands were not as likely to revolt he wrote this apparent freedom deflected the discontent leading negroes to try to exploit their modest advantages rather than to organize for desperate measures as regards wades above statement together with his contention that a concerted revolt against slavery was actually less likely in a city than in a countryside stanley elkins is in sharp disagreement in slavery a problem in american institutional and intellectual life he writes it is of great interest to note that although the danger of slave revolts like communist conspiracies in our own daywas much overrated by touchy southerners the revolts that actually did occur were in no instance planned by plantation laborers but rather by negroes whose qualities of leadership were developed well outside the full coercions of the plantation authoritysystem gabriel who led the revolt of was a blacksmith who lived a few miles outside richmond denmark vesey leading spirit of the plot at charleston was a freed negro artisan who had been born in africa and served several years aboard a slavetrading vessel and nat turner the virginia slave who fomented the massacre of was a literate preacher of recognized intelligence of the plots that have been convincingly substantiated whether they came to anything or not the majority originated in urban centers italics added it could well be as the experiences of gabriel and turner demonstrate that the greater the amount of freedom extended to sensitive negro victims of oppression the more not less they wanted to shatter all restrictions placed upon them was this true of vesey did he seek to right himself and other negroes by leading a vast conspiracy to these questions thanks to the probing work of wade future historians are not likely to offer the facile answers of historians who preceded them nor are they likely to remember the incident in quite the same way what appears to be no less certain is that the evidence when taken as a whole will probably suggest to them as it has to generations of scholars that denmark vesey did lead a conspiracy in charleston south carolina veseys example must be regarded as one of the most courageous ever to threaten the racist foundation of america in him the anguish of

angels now nostalgia in pigalle by hoyt w fuller ts as though dizzy giliw lespie and later miles i davis had never come along to say nothing of innovators like thelonious monk and charlie mingus down at the blue note and the other little right bank boites in the vicinity of champs elysees names like eric dolphy and john coltrane are meaningful but the oldtime jazz is mostly memory but up in montmartre where pigalle remains just about what it always was the old sounds are as familiar as the long shadow of scare coeur la cigale is merely a stone s throw from place pigalle where the arab hustlers have gone modern and peddle feelthy motion pictures instead of the postcard kind and you just walk in off the street and there youll find trumpeter jacques read jack butler leading his quintet in rousing rhythm just as he has been doing regularly since benny waters is there too looking a little like an amiable pullman porter about as american as you can get despite the fact he has been around paris and pigalle as long as jacques has fact is theyve been around together even before world war ii disrupted their lives and sent them temporarily back to the states benny blows a more than dependable saxophone and clarinet and the music gets marvellous when he and jacques take over for an extended dialogue openly playing for applause jacques other american sidemen long ago deserted for the new sounds back home or for the boites down near the seine and there has been a succession of mostly french antillians guadaloupe martinique on bass piano and drums of course the french dont know the difference since there isnt any geneticallybut jacques knows that only the brothers from the states know where it is in jazz down around st germain theres a group calling themselves the jazz kings jacques says shaking his head in commingled mirth and sadness man theyre africans and you ought to hear the stuff they play it would turn your stomach an extra added attraction at la cigale is jacques longtime amie a comely little blond with a compact figure and twinkling toes two or three times during the evening she puts on a onewoman floorshow doing something that approximates the twist the frug and the watusi it is colorful but the routine is a bit hard on the ladyin more ways than one she is no teenager and her steps owe too much to the charleston well of course theres something highly nostalgic about the whole bit up at la cigale jacques and benny like to talk about the times the late sidney bechet and louis armstrong honored the place in appearances and for this visiting stateside brother benny launched into a special number warning beforehand youre too young to know this one it was by fats waller well i remember the records of fats waller but benny was right this version of squeeze me was astonishingly even before my time the evening was grandly topped off by an allholdsbarred rendition of do you know what it means to miss new orleans and the place was nearly packed when jacques and benny finally laid down their horns you dont hear sounds like that anymore around chicago i told them gee i wonder what happened jacques said the hammer man by toni cade was glad to hear that manny had fallen off the roof i had put out the tale that i was down with yellow fever but nobody paid me no mind least of all dirty red who stomped right in to announce that manny had fallen off the roof and that i could come out of hiding now my mother dropped what she was doing which was the laundry and got the whole story out of red bad enough you gots to hang around with boys she said but fight with them too and you would pick the craziest one at that manny was supposed to be crazy that was his story to say you were bad put some people off but to say you were crazywell you were officially not to be messed with so that was his story on the other hand after i called him what i called him and said a few choice things about his mother his face did go through some piercing changes and i did kind of wonder if maybe he sure was nuts i didnt wait to find out i got in the wind and then he waited for me on my stoop all day and all night not hardly speaking to the people going in and out and he was there all day saturday with his sister bringing him peanut butter sandwiches and cream sodas he mustve gone to the bathroom right there cause everytime i looked out the kitchen window there he was and sunday too i got to thinking the boy was mad you got no sense of humor thats your trouble i told him he looked up but he didnt say nothing all at once i was real sorry about the whole thing i shouldve settled for hitting off the little girls in the school yard or waiting for frankie to come in so we could raise some kind of hell this way i had to play sick when my mother was around cause my father had already taken away my bb gun and hid it i dont know how they got manny on the roof finally maybe the wakefield kids the ones who keep the pigeons called him up manny was a sucker for sick animals and things like that or maybe frankie got some nasty girls to go up on the roof with him and got manny to join him i dont know anyway the cat walk had lost all its cement and the roof always did kind of slant downward so manny fell off the roof i got over my yellow fever right quick needless to say and ventured outside but by this time i had already told miss rose that crazy manny was after me and miss rose being who she was quite naturally went over to mannys house and said a few harsh words to his mother who being who she was chased miss rose out into the street and they commenced to get with it snatching bottles out of the garbage cans and breaking them on the johnny pumps and stuff like that dirty red didnt have to tell us about this everybody could see and hear all i never figured the garbage cans for an arsenal but miss rose came up with sticks and table legs and things and mannys mother had her share of scissor blades and bicycle chains they got to rolling in the streets and all you could see was pink drawers and fat legs it was something else miss rose is nutty but mannys mothers crazier than manny they were at it a couple of times during my sick spell everyone would congregate on the window sills or the fireescape commenting that it was still much too cold for this kind of nonsense but they watched anyway and then manny fell off the roof and that was that miss rose went back to her dream books and mannys mother went back to her tumbleddown kitchen of dirty clothes and bundles and bundles of rags and children my father got in on it too cause he happened to ask manny one night why he was sitting on the stoop like that every night manny told him right off that he was going to kill me first chance he got quite naturally this made my father a little warm me being his only daughter and planning to become a doctor and take care of him in his old age so he had a few words with manny first and then he got hold of the older brother bernard who was more his size bernard didnt see how any of it was his business or my fathers business so my father got mad and jammed bernards head into the mailbox then my father started getting messages from bernards uncle about where to meet him for a showdown and all my father didnt say a word to my mother all this time just sat around mumbling and picking up the phone and putting it down or grabbing my stickball bat and putting it back he carried on like this for days till i thought i would scream if the yellow fever didnt have me so weak and then manny fell off the roof and my father went back to his beer drinking buddies i was in the school yard pitching pennies with the little boys from the elementary school when my friend violet hits my brand new spaulding over the wall she came running back to tell me that manny was coming down the block i peeked beyond the fence and there he was alright he had his head all wound up like a mummy and his arm in a sling and his leg in a cast it looked phoney to me especially that walking cane i figured dirty red had told me a tale just to get me out there so manny could stomp me and manny was playing it up with costume and all till he could get me what happened to him violets sisters whispered but i was too busy trying to figure out how this act was supposed to work then manny passed real close to the fence and gave me a look you had enough hammer head i yelled just bring your crummy self in this yard and ill pick up where i left off violet was knocked out and the other kids went into a huddle i didnt have to say anything else and when they all pressed me later i just saidyou know that hammer he always carries in his fatigues and theyd all nod waiting for the rest of a long story well i took it away from him and i walked off nonchalantly manny stayed indoors for a long time i almost forgot about him new kids moved into the block and i got all caught up with that and then miss rose finally hit the numbers and started ordering a whole lot of stuff through the mail and we would sit on the curb and watch these weird looking packages being carried in trying to figure out what simpleminded thing she had thrown her money away on when she might just as well wait for the warm weather and throw a block party for all her godchildren after a while a center opened up and my mother said shed increase my allowance if i went and joined because id have to get out of my pants and stay in skirts on account of thats the way things were at the center so i joined and got to thinking about everything else but old hammer head it was a rough place to get along in the center but my mother said that i needed to be bed with and she needed to not be with me so i went and that time i sneaked into the office thats when i really got turned on i looked into one of those notquitewhite folders and saw that i was from a deviant family in a deviant neighborhood i showed my mother the word in the dictionary but she didnt pay me no mind it was my favorite word after that i ran it in the ground till one day my father got the strap just to show how deviant he could get so i gave up trying to improve my vocabulary and i almost gave up my dungarees then one night im walking pass the douglas street park cause i got thrown out of the center for playing pool when i shouldve been sewing even though i had already decided that this was going to be my last fling with boy things and starting tomorrow i was going to fix my hair right and wear skirts all the time just so my mother would stop talking about her gray hairs and miss rose would stop calling me by my brothers name by mistake so im walking pass the park and theres ole manny on the basketball court perfecting his layups and talking with himself being me i quite naturally walk right up and ask what the hell hes doing playing in the dark and he looks up and all around like the dark had crept up on him when he wasnt looking so i knew right away that hed been out there for a long time with his eyes just going along with the program there was two seconds to go and we were one point behind he said shaking his head and staring at his sneakers like they was somebody and i was in the clear id left the men in the back court and there i was smiling you dig cause it was in the bag they passed the ball and i slid the ball up nice and easy cause there was nothing to worry about and he shook his head i muffed the goddam shot ball bounced off the rim and he stared at his hands the game of the season last game and then he ignored me altogether though he wasnt talking to me in the first place he went back to the layups always from the same spot with his arms crooked in the same way over and over i mustve gotten hypnotized cause i probably stood there for at least an hour watching like a fool till i couldnt even see the damn ball much less the basket but l stood there anyway for no reason i know of he never missed but he cursed himself anyway it was torture and then a squad car pulled up and a short cop with hair like one of the marx brothers came out hitching up his pants he looked real hard at me and then at manny what are you two doing hes doing a layup im watching i said with my smart self then the cop just stood there and finally turned to the other one who was just getting out of the car who unlocked the gate the big one said its always unlocked i said then we three just stood there like a bunch of penguins watching manny go at it this on the level the big guy asked tilting his hat back with the thumb the way big guys do in hot weather hey you he said walking over to manny im talking to you he finally grabbed the ball to get mannys attention but that didnt work manny just stood there with his arms out waiting for the pass so he could save the game he wasnt paying no mind to the cop so quite naturally when the cop slapped him up side his head it was a surprise and when the cop started counting three to go manny had already recovered from the slap and was just ticking off the seconds before the buzzer sounded and all was lost gimme the ball man mannys face was all tightened up and ready to pop did you hear what i said black boy now when somebody says that word i gets warm and crazy or no crazy manny was my brother at that moment and the cop was the enemy you better give him back his ball i said manny dont take no mess from no cops he aint bothering nobody hes gonna be mister basketball when he grows up just trying to get a little practice in before the softball season starts look here sister well run you in too harpo said i damn sure cant be your sister seeing how im a black girl boy i sure will be glad when you run me in so i can tell everybody about that you must think youre in the south mister the big guy screwed his mouth up and let out one of them hardday sighs the parks closed little girl so why dont you and your boyfriend go on home that really got me the little girl was bad enough but that boyfriend was too much but i kept cool mostly because manny looked so pitiful waiting there with his hands in a timeout and there being no one to stop the clock but i kept my cool mostly cause of that hammer in mannys pocket and no telling how frantic things can get what with a bigmouth like me a couple of wise cops and a crazy boy too the gates are open i said real quiet like and this heres a free country so why dont you give him back his ball the big cop did another one of those sighs his specialty i guess and then he bounced the ball to manny who went right into this gliding thing clear up to the backboard damn near like he was some kind of very beautiful bird and then he swooshed that ball in even if there was no net and you couldnt really hear the swoosh something happened to the bones in my chest it was something crazy kids anyhow the one with the wig said and turned to go but the big guy watched manny for a while and i guess something mustve snapped in his head cause all of sudden he was hot for taking manny to jail or court or somewhere and started yelling at him and everything which is a bad thing to do to manny i can tell you and im standing there thinking none of my teachers from kindergarten right on up none of them knew what they were talking about ill be damned if i ever knew one of them rosycheeked cops that smiled and helped you get to school without neither you or your little raggedy dog getting hit by a truck that had a smile on its face too not that i ever believed it i knew dick and jane was full of crap from the get go especially them cops like this dude for example pulling on mannys clothes like that when obviously he had just done about the most beautiful thing a man can do and not be a fag no cop could swoosh without a net look out man was all manny said but it was the way he pushed the cop that started the real yelling and threats and i thought to myself oh god here i am trying to change my ways and not talk back in school and do like my mother wants but just have this last fling and now thisgetting shot in the stomach and bleeding to death in douglas street park and poor manny getting pistolwhipped by those bastards and what not i could see it all practically crying too and it just wasnt no kind of thing to happen to a small child like me with my confirmation picture in the paper next to my weeping parents and school mates i could feel the blood sticking to my shirt and my eyeballs slipping away and then that confirmation picture again and my mother and her gray hair and miss rose heading for the precinct with a shotgun and my father getting old and feeble with no one to doctor him up and all and i wished manny had fallen off the damn roof and died right then and there and saved me all this aggravation of being killed with him by these cops who surely didnt come out of no fifth grade reader but it didnt happen they just took the ball and manny followed them real quiet like right out of the park into the dark then into the squad car with his head drooping and his arms in a crook and i went on home cause what the hell am i going to do on a basketball court and it getting to be nearly midnight i didnt see manny no more after he got into that squad car but they didnt kill him after all cause miss rose heard he was in some kind of big house for people what lose their marbles and then it was spring finally and me and violet was in this very boss fashion show at the center and miss rose bought me my first corsageyellow roses to match my shoes the ssign by sam gf ieenlee t never got bad until we got in the cab and then it would get pro gressively worse iworse learned to just keep my mouth shut at first i would try to make things less tense by cracking jokes but it did no good we always took a cab into town the first two or three saturdays after payday i learned early that i could only stare at the rolling georgia countryside the red clay the pines tall and green in clusters and alone the bright sunshine even when the wind was biting and bitter outside i would stare and count the pines or the clouds or contrast the color combinations or do a number of other things to make the ride seem shorter and none of them worked we had both washed out of ocs for more or less the same reason we couldnt or wouldnt demonstrate that we were impressed enough by the prospect of being an officer in the u s army we were in different ocs companies and had gotten assigned to the same skeleton company of misfits like ourselves and had more or less migrated together it was a mutually gratifying relationship handy because misfits are unwelcome things in the army and they let you know it we found that we had much in common we liked modern literature hemingway for myself and he was a faulkner man hed read sartre and gide and camus in the original we would argue for hours picasso braque the german expressionists the impressionists i taught him how to hook and jab to slip a punch he taught me chess moves i showed him the insides of jazz the blues and where they came from bessie smith and lady day bird and diz he passed along what he knew about the classics we bought a portable phonograph with the first winnings in the payday game sent home for our records and spent hours after duty in the barracks listening pushing the barracks sounds into the background it was like this with the poker game i like poker but i could never take it seriously enough to be as good as i could be at least that was toms analysis tom was a real prohe lost now and then anyone who doesnt cheat loses but he wins a lot more often than he loses we decided to pool a given amount each payday and he would play that and no more as an investment if we lost we always had enough between us to make it into town for at least one fair weekend and to make it through the month on a modified austerity program if we won as was usual we could live it up saturdays were always the best and when we went into town they were also the worst during the week we might play basketball after chow or chess or go to a movie or wander over to the library to see what they had that was new or just chew the fat saturdays we had inspection and the rest of the day was ours we would sit around listening to the music that was almost drowned out by the gis getting ready for a big night sprawled on the bunks while they went through the frenetic frantic ritual of getting ready for the trip to town we would wait taking it easy and untouched by the chaos until the barracks was cleared and then shower and shave with the latrine all to ourselves wed stroll down to the nco club and have a steak with red wine after a couple of martinis coffee and cognac maybe a cigar and think about later that night tom divided his time between a schoolteacher and a secretary he might have had more he is a very good looking guy tall and blonde with an easy laugh and line i had a doctors receptionist with an apartment of her own then we would get up and go outside and get into a cab and then it would start tom would get quiet and tense the silence would seem to get heavier as we moved through the red clay countryside tom staring at nothing his lips thin and tight and me looking out the window and seeing very little he seemed to get smaller and more wound up the closer we got to town chain smoking in the comer as we hit first the row of pawn shops and easyloan offices on the edge of town and then the good looking suburban homes and moved into the city itself id sit in the other corner trying to look relaxed and at ease sure i wasnt doing a very good job and knowing it didnt matter much because tom wasnt seeing much just sitting and smoking and staring we would pull up to the movie and id pay the cabbie and buy the tickets and we would walk into the lobby and id give the tickets to the man at the door and we would walk into the inner lobby and tom would go through the doors ahead and i would turn at the sign over the stairs and walk up to the balcony the sign a very pretty thing in red and gold said colored why i eulogized malcolm_x by ossie davis are not the only person curious to know why i y j would eulogize a man like malcolm_x many who w know and respect me have written letters of these letters i am proudest of those from a sixthgrade class of young white boys and girls who asked me to explain i appreciate your giving me this chance to do so you may anticipate my defense somewhat by considering the following fact no negro has yet asked me that question my pastor in grace baptist church where i teach sunday school preached a sermon about malcolm in which he called him a giant in a sick world every one of the many letters i got from my own people lauded malcolm as a man and commended me for having spoken at his funeral at the same timeand this is importantmost all of them took special pains to disagree with much or all of what malcolm said and what he stood for that is with one singing exception they all every last black gloryhugging one of them knew that malcolmwhatever else he was or was not malcolm was a man white folks do not need anybody to remind them that they are men we do this was his one incontrovertible benefit to his protocol and common sense require that negroes stand back and let the white man speak up for us defend us and lead us from behind the scene in our fight this is the essence of negro politics but malcolm said to hell with that get up off your knees and fight your own battles thats the way to win back your selfrespect thats the way to make the white man respect you and if he wont let you live like a man he certainly cant keep you from dying like one malcolm as you can see was refreshing excitement he scared hell out of the rest of us bred as we are to caution to hypocrisy in the presence of white folks to the smile that never fades malcolm knew that every white man in america profits directly or indirectly from his position visavis negroes profits from racism even though he does not practice it or believe it he also knew that every negro who did not challenge on the spot every instance of racism overt or covert committed against him and his people who chose instead to swallow his spit and go on smiling was an uncle tom and a traitor without balls or guts or any other commonly accepted aspects of manhood now we knew all these things as well as malcolm did but we also knew what happened to people who stick their necks out and say them and if all the lies we tell ourselves by way of extenuation were put into print it would constitute one of the great chapters in the history of mans justifiable cowardice in the face of other men but malcolm kept snatching our lies away he kept shouting the painful truth we whites and blacks did not want to hear from all the housetops and he wouldnt stop for love nor money you can imagine what a howling shocking nuisance this man was to both negroes and whites once malcolm fastened on you you could not escape he was one of the most fascinating and charming men i have ever met and never hesitated to take his attractiveness and beat you to death with it yet his irritation though painful to us was most salutary he would make you angry as hell but he would also make you proud it was impossible to remain defensive and apologetic about being a negro in his presence he wouldnt let you and you always left his presence with the sneaky suspicion that maybe after all you were a man but in explaining malcolm let me take care not to explain him away he had been a criminal an addict a pimp and a prisoner a racist and a hater he had really believed the white man was a devil but all this had changed two days before his death in commenting to gordon parks about his past life he said that was a mad scene the sickness and madness of those days im glad to be free of them malcolm_x continued and malcolm was free no one who knew him before and after his trip to mecca could doubt that he had completely abandoned racism separatism and hatred but he had not abandoned his shockeffect statements his bristling agitation for immediate freedom in this country not only for blacks but for everybody and most of all in the area of race relations he still delighted in twisting the white mans tail and in making uncle toms compromisers and accommodationistsi deliberately include myself thoroughly ashamed of the urbane and smiling hypocrisy we practice merely to exist in a world whose values we both envy and despise but even had malcolm not changed he would still have been a relevant figure on the american scene standing in relation as he does to the responsible civil_rights leaders just about where john brown stood in relation to the responsible abolitionist in the fight against slavery almost all disagreed with browns mad and fanatical tactics which led him foolishly to attack a federal arsenal at harpers ferry to lose two sons there and later to be hanged for treason i yet today the world and especially the negro people proclaim i brown not a traitor but a hero and a martyr in a noble cause so i in future i will not be surprised if men come to see that malcolm_x was within his own limitations and in his own inimitable style also a martyr in that cause but there is much controversy still about this most controversial american and i am content to wait for history to make the final decision but in personal judgment there is no appeal from instinct i knew the man personally and however much i disagreed with him i never doubted that malcolm_x even when he was wrong was always that rarest thing in the world among us negroes a true man and if to protect my relations with the many good white folks who make it possible for me to earn a fairly good living in the entertainment industry i was too chicken too cautious to admit that fact when he was alive i thought at least that now when all the white folks are safe from him at last i could be honest with myself enough to lift my hat for one final salute to that brave black ironic gallantry which was his style and hallmark that shocking zing of fireandbedamnedtoyou so absolutely absent in every other negro man i know which brought him too soon to his death the breaking the bond by lerone bennett jr is about to begin v black men and white men are going to meet for the first a c a if m time in the womb of an american setting v look far off on the horizon is a tiny speck the speck grows larger turns lists and bobbles on the atlantic waves there is a cry a ship a ship on shore and men dash to the waterfront and peer through the late summer haze to the bored and homesick settlers of jamestown virginia the approaching ship is a godsend jamestown the first english settlement in america is a miserable little hole with a handful of huts and almost no diversion the ship heaving into view promises excitement and adventure but there is no way for the men on shore to know how much excitement the ship really contains for in the hold of this ship figuratively speaking is the whole vibrant panorama of negro america the blues and the spirituals booker t washington and martin_luther_king jr the twist and the charleston the bloody anger of gettysburg and the nagging promise of the fourteenth amendment the ship as befitting a messenger of fate is nameless there is an air of intrigue of danger even about the captain one mr jope who comes ashore with an elegant lie on his lips he has just robbed a spanish vessel of a cargo of africans bound for the west indies but he does not mention that he ptends john rolfe notes with suspicion that he is in great need of food and he offers to exchange his cargo for victualled the deal is arranged antonio isabella pedro and seventeen other africans with spanish names debark and an argument begins it is august years before emancipation years before the long hot summer of the question in august of as in august of was what shall we do with for to and about the black people it was a question that would be asked over and over again in the years to come and it would be answered over and over again as it was answered in the beginningwith a compromise it was decided in the summer of to hand the black people over to the colony instead of to individuals the twenty black seeds of jamestown were farmed out to various officials of the colonyand they were farmed out as servants and not slaves in court and church records the first black americans were listed as servants this is a point of immense significance in the history of america the first black immigrants were not slaves nor were the first white immigrants free most of the english colonists in the beginning were indentured servants that is they were sold or they sold themselves to the colony or to individual planters for a stipulated number of years five or seven or more to pay the price for their passage in virginia and other colonies the first black immigrants fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic pattern that carried no implications of racial inferiority during this transitional period of years or more a period of primary importance in the history of america the first negro immigrants mingled with whites on a basis of substantial equality history masks the faces and emotions of the black men and women who lived in this racial wonderland the record burns with their presence but the record is strangely silent on their reactions and the reactions of their white colleagues the black founding fathers enter history thus faceless men uprooted from the warm womb of mother africa and flung willynilly into the wilderness of an outpost of western civilization nothing on the record indicates that the shock was very great for negroes or whites the men and women of the black yeast soon dropped their entrancing spanish names antonio and isabella who were drawn to each other on the trip over married and became parents of the first negro child born in english america in the black boy was christened william tucker in a jamestown church thus in the span of a few years the negro soul moved from africa to spain to americafrom x to antonio to william within the next few years scores of africans made the leap by there were three hundred black folk in a population of about fifteen thousand some came directly from england where negroes had lived since others came from spain portugal and the west indies a large number of these pioneer migrants were christians baptized either in spain or england john phillip for example testified in a jamestown court in and his testimony against a white man was admitted because he had been christened in england twelve years since some perhaps all of the first group of africanamericans worked out their terms of servitude and were freed within a few years the more energetic were accumulating property pounds and indentured servants anthony johnson americas first black capitalist earned the dubious honor of being the first person in the colony to hold a negro as a servant for life still another negro richard johnson imported a white man and held him in servitude this apparently was integration with a vengeance but let us take care not to exaggerate it is as certain as death that there were racists then but the record indicates that some negroes were accorded social privileges about equal to those accorded to freed white servants more importantly negro freedmen seem to have had the same industrial and economic opportunities as white servants within the confines of this system which can only be called equality of repression negroes fared about as well as whites they held real property and transferred it sued in court and were sued some negroes voted and a few held the minor offices of beadle and surety in a limited sense then the jamestown experience was an open experience negroes were free to express themselves according to their personalities and their different lights they could live with white people if they wanted to or they could live without them and some negroes interestingly enough wanted to live without them on the banks of the pungoteague river in northampton county a handful of negroes established americas first harlem in anthony johnson imported five servants and received headrights a grant of so many acres per servant imported of two hundred acres along the pungoteague other johnsons and other negroes moved to the burgeoning development the settlement throve but not without a certain dissension the johnsons were a proud contentious folk and they were soon in court suing each other over infringements of contract or property the johnson settlement at its height included no more than a dozen or so negroes with very large holdings other negroes were scattered throughout the colony in integrated communities in benjamin doyle received a patent for three hundred acres in surrey county john harris in bought fifty acres in new kent county and phillip morgan with great optimism leased two hundred acres in york county for ninetynine years morgans optimism was not entirely groundless the bulk of the population at that time consisted of indentured servants who were remarkably free from racial prejudice whites and negroes worked in the same fields lived in the same huts and fraternized during offduty hours and predictably they mated and married there was widespread intermingling between negroes and whites throughout the colonial period colonial virginia peter fontaine said swarmed with mulatto children in this period little or no distinction was made between indentured servants and negro slaves and servants what little prejudice there was stemmed mostly from english class prejudice white servants and negro servants were assigned the same tasks and many masters held them in equal contempt it was not unusual in those days for a master to force a white woman servant to marry a negro nor was it unusual for negro servants to serve as overseers over negro and white work forces of particular interest in this context of developing community is the fact that white and negroes of the working class made common cause against the master class they often ran away together and in several communities they staged interracial revolts working together in the same fields sharing the same huts the same situation and the same hope the first negro and white americans aristocrats excepted developed strong bonds of sympathy and mutuality there was no barrier psychological or otherwise between them and circles of community and solidarity began to widen skin color had a meaning then but not the meaning it has now the basic division was between servants and free people and there were whites and negroes on both sides of the line one has to make an effort to grasp the contours of this world it seems somehow unamerican as undoubtedly it was since it has existed in america for only one brief spell and then by default a negro in this world could almost feel at home there was not the fatal split between being an american whatever that is and being a negro whatever that is if there was prejudice then and there was it was not organized and sustained by the intractable will of an entire community there was not in fact an agreedupon name for the phenomena to be excludedand names are indispensable for good exclusion the first negroes were called blackmoors moors negers and negars the word negro a derivative of spanish and portuguese forms did not come into general use until later by that time the reality it was supposed to denote had assumed cancerous proportions in mens minds but to repeat one must be careful not to idealize one suspects that even then negroes asked themselves in the closeness of their hearts who am i god and what one suspects that the first generation of black americans remembered the old gods and the old ways and moaned the plaintive cry of the exiled jew by the river of jordan they sat us down and said sing us a song but how can i sing the lords song in a strange land how indeed and which lord from the beginning there was a tenuous subtle pressure more menacing perhaps because it was shapeless and nameless the tension points then and now were sex and status then as now the thrust came from fear fear of self fear of the unknown fear of the differentfear and a monstrous fascination in a white man was denounced for lying with a negro woman which was said by the governing class to be an abuse to the dishonor of god and the shame of christians he was ordered soundly whipped before an assemblage of negroes it is a measure of the progress in civilization that ten years later the white man in a similar episode was ordered to do penance in church and the negro woman was soundly whipped sex continued to be a problem in the early colonies not to the servants who got on famously but to the aristocrats who were scandalized by the broad tolerance of the first englishwomen a system of intimidation was organized which increased in severity forty years after the jamestown landing white women were being whipped and sold into slavery or extended servitude for showing open preference for negro men the problem of sex was largely a problem of the negro male which is to say that it was a problem of power in the s and s which marked a slight shift in the relations between negroes and whites tentative restrictions were placed on the negro males in for example all colonists except negroes were required to arm themselves this restriction and others of similar weight and meaning were reflections of a mounting fear in the world of men to grasp the significance of this development one must first understand the world context in which it occurred the planting of black folk on american soil and their subsequent degradation were episodes in a worldwide drama the african slave trade the detailed story of the slave trade does not concern us here what does concern us is the extraordinary nature of the initial contacts between europeans and africans africa and europe in the fifteenth century were on the same level of toynbees vaulted precipice of glory in fact in some areas africans were a ledge or two ahead the sudanese empire with its worldfamous showplace of timbuctu had passed its peak but it could still show europe a thing or twothe university of sankore for example and intellectuals like es sadi who owned a private library of sixteen hundred volumes at a time when the whole of america was a howling wilderness nor was that all there were huge empires and populous citiessome as large as all but the largest european citiesalong the coast europeans noting these things greeted africans as allies and partners in trade the recorded reminiscences of traders show that down to the eighteenth century they had no conception of their victims as racial pariahs on the contrary many traders expressed a belief that africans were their equal and the superiors of many back home if europeans forgot their place there were africans in this period to remind them the first africans were rather contemptuous of european claims they did not in any wise consider themselves inferior if anything they considered themselves superior to the oddlooking men with pale skins the king of dahomey seldom shook hands with white men and when he did it was a very uncommon mark of royal condescension a french trader complained in that the fanti were so proud and haughty that a european trader there must stand bare to them standing up to each other as men and as equals both africans and europeans profited plenipotentiaries were exchanged and bright young men of the ruling classes went to lisbon and rome to study and observe black and white kings exchanged letters filled with terms of royal endearment my fellow brother and my fellow queen they also exchanged gifts and mistresses of various hues and dispositions shakespeares laudatory phrase i speak of africa and golden joys was not conjured up out of the air the phrase was solidly grounded in the realities of life in the first phase of the africaneuropean dialogue a dialogue consisting of trade in men and goods and ideas as in jamestown africans speedily absorbed the fundamentals of the european way of life on may one hundred years before the jamestown landing henry of the congo led a mission to the vatican formally addressed the pope in latin and was appointed bishop of the congo in rome lisbon and other european control centers africans rose to high positions in church and state and negro gametes were scattered throughout the populations of europe by the southern portion of portugal was predominantly negro and as far north as lisbon negroes outnumbered whites descendants of these christianized africans were among the first settlers of the new world as slaves servants and scouts they accompanied spanish french and portuguese explorers in the pioneer penetrations of north and south africa thirty negroes were with balboa when he discovered the pacific ocean three hundred went with cortez into mexico and some of them planted and harvested the first wheat crop in the new world the shape of this period is summed up in an old saying the first white man to meet an indian in america was a negro this was true in many areas of north and south america a bold negro explorer estevanico opened up the southwest for the spaniards negroes helped to found st augustine in and made up a large portion of its population during the colonial period negroes were in florida alabama new mexico and california as early as and respectively perhaps the first permanent settlers in america were the africans who accompanied lucas vasquez de ayllon the spanish explorer in de ayllon settled in the area of presentday south carolina with five hundred white men one hundred africans and eightynine horses a few months later the africans revolted slew several whites and fled to the indians in the fervor of worldwide exploration and the commingling of peoples from different lands and cultures new vistas opened up for both africans and europeans it seemed for a spell that christianity would have the same fertilizing influence in africa in the sixteenth century as islam had had in the eleventh and twelfth centuries but it was not to be while the bright young black men were feasting in the courts of lisbon while the eager black priests were genuflecting in the courts of the vatican the dream was dissolving in granules of greed ships were already plying the seas men were already experimenting with sugar caneit was not to be the opening of the new world and the introduction of sugar planting in the west indies created a demand for men that casual kidnapping could not supply mens visions shifted now from the poor whites of europe to the poor blacks of africa and the africaneuropean dialogue became a monologue focused almost exclusively on a trade in men in vain did some of the more farsighted african monarchs plead for an extension of the old trade in goods and ideas in manicongo the ruler of the congo states made a desperate attempt to end the slave trade in a strong letter to john iii of portugal manicongo said we need it from your kingdoms no other than priests and people to teach in schools and no other goods but wine and flour for the holy sacrament that is why we beg of your highness to help and assist us in this matter commanding the factors that they should send here neither merchants nor wares because it is our will that in these kingdoms of the congo there should not be any trade in slaves or markets for slaves we would be living in a different world today if manicongos plea for point iv aid and peace corps personnel had been heeded in the sixteenth century but europe was impervious to such pleas she was only interested in the gold of black bodies and she forced that obsession on africato the undoing of both europe and africa as a result of the slave trade white europe became a single group opposed to the rest of the world and a new and terrifying idea was invented the idea of subordination and superordination based on skin color slavery contrary to the general impression did not spring from racism racism sprang from slavery the concept of race was a direct outgrowth of the slave trade and it was deliberately invented by an exploiting group which needed a theology to maintain and defend privileges founded on naked force the first act of the slave trade the exchange of men and goods and ideas unfolded against the permissive backdrop of the medieval world which sanctioned negro and white slavery but the slave trade soon took a more ominous turn within a few years fifty thousand or more black men and women were crossing the atlantic each year and the soil of africa and america was drenched with their blood in the wake of this development a need arose for justification of that which could not be justified by any theory in western thought by this time of course the slave trade was the bulwark of the whole european economy a fact which made the search for a theology more desperate blessed are men who can steal without the need of theology for when the need for justification arises the thief and his cause are more than halflost as long as manstealing and manselling occasioned no public outcry the slave trader could fight down his doubts but when voices cried out in rebuke and remonstrance men cast about for a reassuring straw it was evil of course to ravage continents and exterminate hundreds of thousands of black and red men but what if what if negroes and indians were not men in the same sense that europeans were on this questionwhat ifwas raised a terrifying theology of guilt and fear europe emerged now as the great white subject in counterpoise to the nonwhite other the europe of plato and socrates was invaded by a new spirit a spirit born of the renaissance and the commercial revolution there was something amoral about this spirit something demonic faustian and recklessly individualistic stimulated by the invention of paper gunpowder and printing the three often went together and the opening of a whole new world beyond europe threw itself with a bloody spasm across the face of the earth ravaging plundering tearing down and yes building up this thunderous outer event when fed into the stream of internal colonial politics produced explosive changes negroes and whites in the american colonies began to experience each other in different ways they began to withdraw into themselves and to prepare in their different lights for the confrontation to come i rx si in the crucial period between and the furies began to gather in america for a portentous decision some negroes in this period were servants and some were free but an increasingly large number of colonists were falling into the habit of regarding incoming africans as servants for life this development a reflection of eddies and currents in the outer world was menacing but not conclusive the negros status until the latter part of the seventeenth century was so amorphous that ultimately it could have been defined in any one of a number of ways slavery or modified slavery was a distinct possibility for all disadvantaged peopleindians as well as black and white immigrants so was an open society socioeconomic forcesa worldwide demand for tobacco and the development of capitalist planting techniques based on the use of gang labortilted the structure in the direction of negro slavery in the fateful sixties of the seventeenth century men of power in the colonies egged on by men of power in london made a catastrophic decision that would lead step by step to the fateful sixties of the nineteenth century and the fateful sixties of the twentieth it was decided in the s to ground the american economic system on human slavery organized around the random distribution of melanin in mens skins beginning around the planter class drafted and passed laws that made negroes servants for life intermarriage was interdicted and children born of negro women were ruled bond or free according to the status of the mother this was the fatal and perhaps irreparable break in the sense of community between negro and white americans it was the starting point the first turn on the road to the summer of and the dangers beyond having made one step the white power structure had to take another more ominous step nature does not prepare men for the roles of master and slave it requires rigid training long persisted in to make a slave or a slaveholder men must be carefully taught and the lessons taught one generation must be learned anew by the next the negro and white working class of the s the bulk of the population had not been prepared for the roles outlined in the new script of statutes it was necessary therefore to teach negroes and whites that they should not and could not deal with each other on the basis of reciprocity of emotion and relation and this remarkably enough proved exceedingly difficult the forced breaking of the bond can be traced with precision in the emotionallytoned areas of love and sextwo constitutive factors in communitas which is by definition a state of organic wholeness between equals residing in a common territory equals who extend to each other complete reciprocity or the possibility of complete reciprocity in positive affects love sexual union marriage friendship social communion and communal conventions property law trade the complete severing of the fragile bonds of community in the areas of positive affects became the dominant note in planter strategy fearing a deterioration of slavery if the boundaries between white and black people were dissolved in the caldron of sexual intimacy the planter class mobilized every unit of power for an assault on intermingling legislatures began to grind out laws of every imaginable description virginia legislated against intermingling in there were similar legislative paroxysms in other states maryland passed antiamalgamation laws in the sentiment of the aristocratic lawmakers leaped out from the dry statutes in words like spurious issue disgrace of the nation defiline private vigilante associations and racial purists whipped the doubtful into line behind the purists and the good grey lawmakers stood god himself in the person of parsons who blessed the rupture in community with words from the holy bible but astoundingly nothing worked against the law as revealed by the parson and the legislator intermarriage and intermingling continued in america for more than one hundred years men would say later that there was a natural antipathy between negroes and whites that no law could mitigate but the record belies them negroes and whites were taught hate and fear they were driven apart by symbols sermons and signed papers every instrument of persuasionlaw religion prison banishmentwas used to destroy the developing bonds of community between negro and white americans who was responsible for this policy the planters the aristocrats the parsons the lawyers the founding fathersthe good people they sowed the seeds of the bitter harvest james hugo johnston who made a detailed study of this problem placed the responsiblity squarely on the shoulders of the governing class johnston wrote the system of life built up in the agricultural colonies resulted in planter control both social and governmental institutions were devices wrought by the planters the system of slavery may have been thrust upon them by england but the problems arising from it were first of all the planters problems and on the governing class is the responsibility for the system worked out in the colonies planters were motivated primarily by economic considerations but johnston added it is also to be believed that the planters wished to develop an attitude of race superiority through a fear that at some future time the poor white might lead the mulatto and the negro in revolt against the established order my emphasis how was this policy justified at first the rationalization was religion negroes were condemned not because they were negroes but because they were nonchristians the limitations of this policy were glaringly apparent it was not permanent men could become christians as an increasingly large number of negroes became christians planters cast about for a more enduring disability something that could not be changed but before this step could be made it was necessary to clear up certain theological difficulties a celebrated divine wrote a long book of two hundred or more pages to prove that it was not a sin to baptize slaves with great seriousness puritans and planters debated this issue and decided that christianity and slavery were not incompatible it was decided moreover that it was a duty a christian duty to bring barbarians into the folds of christian civilization so their souls could be cleansed for the heavens beyond thus in the end god and profits were reconciled virginia in clothed the ideological sleightofhand in legal language the conferring of baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom after that it was easy the negro population which had grown slowly during the twilight interim of freedom lunged forward by the number had increased to fifty thousand when the declaration of independence was signed there were five hundred thousand negroes in america not all negroes were reduced to slavery remnants of a free negro class survived and grew by natural additions manumissions and escapes the status of free negroes during the early part of the eighteenth century was relatively high but as slavery fastened itself on the minds of men free negroes were pushed down to a status that was almost indistinguishable from bondage what happened now dwarfed everything that had happened before the jamestown experience the early african experience antonio isabella manicongo all were forgotten there emerged an image of the negro as a person who was powerless not because he lacked power but because of some inherent defect in his character a defect related in some mysterious way to the packets of melanin in his skin the negro became in lewis c copelands phrase a contrast conception he was black to the white mans white he was the devil to the white mans god he was dark to the white mans light it was not necessary within this conceptual framework for men to do anything one was born white and in this aspect one inherited the earth propelled by this psychic dynamism the white ego expanded puffed up exploded and rolled across the face of the earth absorbing the consciousness and the souls of men born black red and brown the effect of all this whatever the intention and the intention was not far removed from the effect was to deprive the negro of legal force and standing in the community of men it was to make him a person outside the protection of law an exile a stranger and an outcast this as thomas jefferson pointed out in a rejected draft of the declaration of independence was war against human nature or at least against that part of human nature enshrined in black skins for more than four hundred years this war continued before it was over one hundred million black people had perished and twenty million more had been scattered over the western hemisphere when the war started there was no mask between black men and white menthere was no screen between insult and retaliation stimulus and response blow and retort black men and white men therefore stood toe to toe hacking burning and slashing murder piled on murder and a red ribbon of violence enclosed black people and white people in a circle of fate direct violent resistance this was the black mans first response to white power resistance began with sitdowns and hunger strikes on slave ships although every precaution was taken although the males were shackled together and guards walked the decks with drawn cutlasses day and night there were repeated uprisings on the slave ships at least fiftyfive documented mutinies between and not to mention fragmentary references to two hundred more the struggle continued on land there was a slave revolt in hispaniola as early as the governor immediately asked for a temporary suspension of the slave trade because the negroes encouraged the indians to rebellion twentyfour years later the struggle moved to the american mainland with the revolt of the one hundred africans who accompanied lucas de ayllon direct violent resistance continued and reached a peak in the nineteenth century herbert aptheker the authority on american negro slave revolts has documented at least insurrections and conspiracies in continental america although some of his sources have been questioned there can be little doubt that revenge and revolt were dominant motifs in the reactionpatterns of the first africanamericans the negroes who came to america in the eighteenth century were strikingly different from those conditioned by one hundred years of bondage the first africanamericans saw themselves through the prism of the old gods they did not feel inferior to the white men and what is more to the point white men were not so sure that they were superior to them there were accordingly repeated revolts in slaves in new york city revolted and killed at least nine whites and a virginia plot of prompted the lieutenant governor to order white men to take their pistols to church with them the first negro leader to emerge with any clarity from the anonymity of the masses cato of stono was an advocate of direct violent resistance in cato led a slave revolt near stono south carolina the black rebels under catos leadership killed several whites fired a number of buildings and set out for florida which was held then by spain they called out liberty a contemporary account marched on with colours displayed and two drums beating some twentyfive whites were killed before cato and his group were subdued before anything else could be done before the fields could be tilled before monticello and mount vernon could be built the first generation of africanamericans men made in the image of cato had to be mastered the breaking of the slave the destruction of the african as an individualthis was the first task before the pioneer white americans in order for slavery to succeed it was necessary to annihilate the thinking processes of slaves naked power was not enough the white mans power had to be internalized the slave in other words had to be robbed of his selfconception and selfrespect he had to become someone else or pretend he was someone else much has been said and rightly about the physical violence of slavery equally harsh and far crueller was the mental violence the wrenching of minds out of cerebral sockets and the crushing of bones of belief and habit in order to control people as we learned from europeans in german concentration camps and americans in chinese concentration camps it is necessary to subject them to constant fatigue constant insecurity and overwhelming power in a closed system long before hitler long before mao tsetung southern planters had mastered these elementary techniques anticipating the devious tactics of the modem police state masters laid hands on the minds of their chattel by the old method of the carrot and the stick by terror and by smiles by whips chains words symbols prayers and curses the negro was taught to stand in fear of white power in some such manner africans were given a new conception of themselves a conception that carried as coreelements guilt anxeity and inferiority the laying of hands on the mind of a whole people the pulling out by the roots of old customs and habits continued for hundred of years hundreds of thousands died in the process and hundreds of thousands went insane but millions survived maimed to be sure shrunken shriven diminue but withal alive and breathing with enough fragmentary memories of the past to give them a mooring in the present and hope for the future the terms of that survival were harsh and selfenforcing in order to survive the slave had to give up or pretend to give up that which makes man humanhope ambition responsibility and will no slave could stand up to life as a human being to live for a slave especially a male slave was to renounce to renounce anger and love and indignation to renounce hate and human hurt to renounce the claims and the rewards of love the responsibilities of parenthood and the pride of ownershipto renounce these things voluntarily in the service of a higher ideal but at the command of another human will arbitrarily imposed by society millions learned to wear masks of renunciation in the inferno of slavery but few adjusted to their situation james redpath and others who called slavery a state of perpetual war between master and slave cut to the bone of the problem that which was human in the slave was always at war with that in the master which breached the bounds of the human far from being a humane institution american slavery was diabolically cured in that it robbed the negro of that sense of human dignity which underlies all social intercourse slavery destroyed the negros family emptied his mind and impoverished his soul more than that it made him doubt himself nor did the master escape unlimited power over menand especially womenis debasingone pays a price for it in the attempted absorption and destruction of negro consciousness the white man remoulded himself and involved himself catastrophically with an image that was both loved and hated white man entered into negro as w j cash said but negro also entered into white man subtly influencing every thought every gesture every desire and the two groups thus impaled thrashed about repicrocally making and destroying each other in an embrace until death or salvation between the master and the slave between the white man who approached the negro in the aspect of a master and the negro who responded in the aspect of a slave there was absolute silence it was impossible for the two to communicate because the ground of communicationequality responsibility and mutual trusthad been destroyed beyond that was the obvious fascination of black skin for white men and women the master opened his eyes on a soft black mother surrogate who ever afterwards held him in the lap of a monstrous and forbidden dream the black mammy who extended the breast he sucked as a child the black mammy who mashed with her own hands the food he ate who sang to him strange lullabies and led him smiling into sleep this image colored his dreaming and his desiring and later of course it was this womans daughter or in many cases what turned out to be the same thing his father s daughter who initiated him into the mysteries of love incest plied on incest behind the cotton curtain of slavery and the whole faulknerian drama turned in on itself in an orgy of oblique fears men asked themselves other men asked them what have you become what in the name of god have you made yourself and of course there could be no answer short of the grave for master or slave white man and negro were estranged perhaps beyond reconciliation but so were the negro and the white state slavery was aggression against the negro personality by individual masters but it was also aggression by the state which gave to a surrogate power to hold restrain work whip convey and sell human beings with the backing or at least the silence of every structure of power in america negroes were stripped of those rights of personality that are usually considered sacred between men vice immortality and brutality were institutionalized and given names the sanctity of the family was violated children were sold from mothers and fatherhood was abolished it is not generally recognized that american slavery was significantly different and vastly more oppressive than slavery in other areas in south america and the caribbean there was a margin of personality that the master could not violate in america the slave belong to the master absolutely it was true literally true that the slave had no rights that white men were bound to respect the old south was a totalitarian system dominated by one party the party of planters the party line was cotton and human slavery no deviation from this point of view was permitted either in the church school or legislature nor was silence enough men were required to say often and loud that slavery was good and that freedom was bad things reached such a pass that the declaration of independence was repudiated and thomas jefferson was denounced as an unstable reformer infected by unamerican ideas in the end southern newspapers and southern intellectuals demanded that the north endorse a crusade for the permanent enslavement of free negroes and poor white immigrants in the south planter strategy was based on the old maxim divide et impera divide and rule planters learned early to hide behind the images of the overseers who were usually poor whites and the drivers who were members of the oppressed class thus there grew up the myth of the good white folk who were supposed to be above the crudities of the poor white class on large plantations most slaves never came into contact with the real power only a crisis would reveal the true nature of the system most slaves therefore did not focus their resentment against their real enemy the planter but against the poor whites who furnished most of the overseers and who were the poor whites they were white people who happened to be poor they lived on the poor land planters did not want like slaves they hated not planters who were the real authors of their ills but negroes whom they saw as threats to their social economic and psychological wellbeing all this was pure windfall to the planter class which consciously and unconsciously fanned the flames of hate between poor whites and negroes fanned the flames and thereby controlled both classes utterly not only poor whites but astoundingly free negroes in the south accepted the planters definition of the situation this is not to say that there were no brilliant and dedicated free negroes but the great majority of free negroes in the south accepted the planterinspired myth that the basic division in america was not between negroes and whites but between free people negroes and whites and slaves having accepted this definition free negroes in the south were leisurely pushed down to a position that was not radically different from slavery having divided free negroes and slaves and whites and negroes planters turned now to a destruction of the community of victims in a desperate attempt to prevent the growth of solidarity and racial pride the only qualities on which a mass movement could base itself planters exerted constant pressure from without and fostered internal divisions within throughout the slave period as abraham lincoln pointed out there were packets of explosive material on every plantation what was lacking was the indispensable connecting train agitators organizers leaders to prevent the necessary connection between agitation and explosive packets planters concentrated on three key elementsfreedom of assembly freedom of movement and privacy of the home where arms could be hidden the slave codes the crystallization of planter strategy forbade slaves to assemble in groups of more than five or seven away from their home plantation slaves were forbidden to leave plantations without passes and they could not blow horns beat drums or read books slave patrols or paderollers as the slaves called them were authorized to make periodic searches of slave cabins the whole complex apparatus of control was designed to isolate the slave and to cut him away from social moorings but external control was not enough slavery could not succeed without the complicity of the enslaved to oppress negroes more effectively masters made use of selected slaves as agents spies and bellwethers this ancient technique was facilitated because of the differing relations of slaves to the center of power the basic division a division with implications and ramifications that color contemporary negro life was between house slaves and field slaves in the context of current realities it is definitely a hostile act to call a man a house negro or a descendant of house slaves the house slave syndrome a certain servility before white power and a fawning imitation of white models is used repeatedly today as a weapon of attack in the struggles for power within the negro community who were house slaves how did they come by their low repute house slaves were defined spatially and psychologically by their physical and mental proximity to the master class and their relative isolation from the great mass of negroes who were field slaves house slaves worked in and around the house maids butlers gardeners or performed special services as artisans and technicians as a group house slaves were exceptionally useful to masters who told them they were different who urged them and in some cases commanded them to keep their distance from the masses at the apex of the slave elite was the driver who maintained order in the quarters and bossed the slaves in the fields the driver was the archetype of the negro leader and his image would exert an enormous influence on the expectations and attitudes of both negroes and whites after slavery like practically all negro leaders until modern times the driver was an agentof the master class it was his duty to restrain negroes to pacify them and to see that they worked hard his relationship to negroes was anomalous to say the least having no power of his own existing at the sufferance of the planter and receiving minor perquisites so long as he supported the planters interest the driver operated in a twilight world between the oppressed and the oppressor that some negroes cooperated with masters and helped to make the slave system work should occasion no surprise it has been so among all people at all times the iron law of power is that most men of whatever color of whatever tongue will accommodate themselves to their situation and that a small minority on the left will protest while another minority on the right will seek to capitalize on the situation by ingratiating themselves with the powers that be it was so with the negro in slavery it was so with americans in chinese concentration camps it will be so as long as power is power and men are men what surprises above all in the slave experience is the amount of slave cohesiveness despite strong centrifugal forces there was a bond of sympathy between slave groups one discerns in the literature a systematic attempt to overemphasize the degree of intragroup conflict one student said there was little cohesion among slaves because there was not enough counterpressure to prevent collaboration this is an oversimplification of a complex problem there is never enough counterpressure to prevent collaboration in a totalitarian system france and other countries had a fair amount of social cohesion in world war ii but there was a bumper crop of collaborators in the slave quarters as in france collaboration evoked the ire of the community of victims in tennessee for example a slave named jim killed a slave named isaac for helping to catch him after his escape at the trial the judge observed that isaac seems to have lost caste he had combined with the white folks no slight offense in their eyes that one of their own color subject to a like servitude should abandon the interests of his caste and betray black folks to the white people rendered him an object of general aversion subject to a like servitude sharing the same interests excluded from the general community and proscribed by law slaves of all ranks developed their own society which differed in many ways from the society of masters the locus of this community was the slave quarters the embryo of the harlems of today all slaveshouse and fieldwere members of the community of victims there were as we have noted chasms between slave groups but there were also bridges the basic fact in plantation life was race and slaves no matter how high they rose or how light their skin were blackand they knew it the basic psychological fact is that the slave elite needed the field slaves if only to have someone to look down on in the quarters slaves of all ranks could drop their masks in the circle of suffering they could stretch out their legs and their souls paradoxically the slaves who lived in closest proximity to white influence were the slaves most maimed those furthest removed from white influence on the other hand were the freest in the harlems of the plantations field hands had a small but nonetheless important area of freedom for a small part of the day they were not under the thumbs and feet of white people thus a man or woman could build a fragile windbreak against white power it is not at all surprising that the deep and brooding spirituals and the embryonic blues came not from the house but from the field between the society of masters and the society of victims there was little interaction conflict did not grow out of their situation it was inherent in that situation the attempt to deny negroes even a minimum of social life involved negro slaves and masters in a web of espionage a web of waiting and watching of measuring and spying and maneuvering in this web it was every slave against every white man and every triumph over the master no matter how petty was recognized as a triumph for the cause jeanpaul sartres description of resistance in occupied france illuminates the nature of the struggle between master and slave in the old south everywhere he wrote on billboards in the newspapers on the screen we encountered the revolting and insipid picture of ourselves that our oppressors wanted us to accept because the nazi venom seeped even into our thoughts every accurate thought was a conquest because an allpowerful police tried to force us to hold our tongues every word took on the value of a declaration of principles because we were hunted down every one of our gestures had the weight of a solemn commitment there were no billboards in slavery but there were tyrantsand there were men who stood up to tyrants every slave protest direct or subtle was a step in the development of new forms of life organization every slave protest was a choice made in the face of death for life a slave underground crystallized around the stealing of goods the trading of information on the intentions and state of mind of the enemy and the hiding and passing on of fugitive slaves all slaves did not participate in the underground somea definite minorityhad been so crushed by slavery that they were timid and afraid othersmainly house servantshad been so conditioned by the castoff clothes and castoff ideas of their masters that they kissed their chains still others a definite majoritymaintained a sense of expectancy and hope that is one of the most memorable tributes to the indomitable tenacity of the human spirit the dominant response of the vast majority of slaves were discontent unrest and protest there were repeated insurrections and there is solid evidence that the south lived in constant fear of the docile slaves the most dramatic form of resistance was terrorism arson murder sabotage carried out for the most part by the socalled bad negro a germinal figure in negro folklore slaves also used a variety of techniques in undramatic daytoday resistance to slavery on occasions they staged sitdowns and slowdowns in the cotton fields on impulse sometimes and sometimes on plan they sat down and refused to move until work loads were lightened some groups fled to the forests at the height of the cottonpicking season and sent emissaries to negotiate with old master quieter still and equally effective was the daytoday sabotage the gate left open for cattle to escape the expensive tool or implement accidentally dropped or broken at one time or another almost all slaves dropped their masksa little the dissatisfied look the slow unwilling movement the labored stroke of the hoe the drawling tone the slow hearing the feigned stupidity the sham pains and sickness the short memory and always the mocking smile and the accusing laugh these were the tactics of the undramatic slave despite or perhaps because of all attempts to crush it the rebellious will of the slave endured there was something tragic about this stubborn will but there was also something heroic about it by escaping or helping others to escape by reading and teaching others to read by stealing and helping others to steal by homicide suicide and infanticide the slave opposed his will to his masters the unpleasant fact is that slaves did not feel that they had unqualified moral obligations to white peopleand white people knew it it was considered right and proper to steal from white people and to lie to them in an odd reversal of the taney dictum slaves acted as though white people had no rights they were bound to respectif they were clever enough and quick enough frederick douglass the great exslave put his pen on the heart of the matterthe break in community he was he said a slave of society which has in fact in form and substance bound itself to assist the white man in robbing me of my rightful liberty and the just rewards of my labor as a result douglass said whatever rights i have against the master i have equally against those confederated with him in robbing me of my liberty since society has marked me out as privileged plunder on the principle of selfpreservation i am justified in plundering in turn this attitude of defiance and protest flows out of the bottomless well of the negro folk tradition few slaves wrote books but almost all of them sang songs and told stories it is to these stories and songs we must go for the slaves comment on his condition the spirituals the bestknown of negro folk products speak of exile and homelessness of wandering in some lonesome valley or down some unknown road a long way from home without father or mother or sister or brother the spirituals speak of sorrow and despair but there is something else a cosmic discontent a discontent so deep and pervasive that only the blind or hard of hearing can miss it in these songs the slave commented on a world composed of masters and slavescommented and analyzed and judged he also used song as a means of communication the whoops hollers and field calls contained secret messages about meeting places intentions and dangers as a matter of fact double meanings permeate the whole fabric of negro sacred and secular music consider for example the symbols of release de walls come tumblin down of battle joshua fit de battle of jericho the judgment pharoahs army got drowned consider also the obvious fact that the slaves identified with the hebrew children and projected their hostility and hate onto pharoah the slave symbol for the white master the biblical symbols did not appeal to all slaves scholarly interest in the spirituals has obscured the fact that the great majority of slaves were non if not antichristian the secular songs of this group were irreverent and impudent some which later metamorphosed into the blues were existentially absurd the negro slave also protested obliquely in story and folklore a deep and bitter strain of hostility runs through the cycle of animal stories particularly the brer rabbit series which a southern newspaperman collected from exslaves and put into the mouth of a stereotype uncle remus uncle remus was joel chandler harris creation but the hostility and the malevolent rabbit in bernard wolfes phrase came from the negros heart the central theme of the stories is the defeat of a powerful and wicked animal the white man by a weak and clever animal the negro in the animal cycle the weak prevails over the strong and evil meets an avenger for the slave the stories of rabbits outwitting and eventually leading foxes to death were a psychological release and a creative selfprojection this image of revolt and revenge became flesh in the leaders of the three great slave revolts and conspiracies gabriel prosser richmond virginia denmark vesey charleston south carolina nat turner southampton county virginia though separated by time and space prosser vesey and turner were of a piece prosser and turner were field slaves turner was a preacher and prosser was a biblical student who found food for insurrection in the blood and doom passages of the old testment vesey on the other hand was a free man a welltodo carpenter he was by his own admission satisfied with his condition yet he risked his life and paid the supreme price in a bold effort to free his brothers vesey was relatively old about fiftyfour turner and prosser were young thirtyone and twentyfour respectively the three men were obsessed by one dominant idea the destruction of all white people in their view the enemy was society the only solution they believed was a war of immediate and total extermination nat turner was moved by a mystical obsession that god had called him to rise up and slay my enemies with their own weapons like joan of arc he had provocative visions of the impending doom of his adversaries gabriel and vesey on the other hand were motivated by the revolutionary concepts of the american haitian and french revolutions gabriel and his men in fact had purchased a white silk flag on which were inscribed the words liberte on mort of the three men nat turner came closest to succeeding for fortyeight hours he held southampton county in a black embrace of death with a long bloody sprawl he threw himself on his masters and slew sixty men women and children before he was defeated nat was hanged finally but his spirit lived on his career it has been said made an impact upon the south as great as the careers of john c calhoun or thomas jefferson after nat it was no longer possible for men to pretend there were men in the slave quarters one could not always depend on their masks at any moment the mask could turn into a horrid face of blood and vengeance gabriel prosser and denmark vesey did not succeed they were thwarted at the last moment by the treachery of house slaves but the record shows that they were leaders of largescale liberation movements both men laid their plans with great care storing weapons and disguises and creating huge organizations under the eyes and noses of the masters gabriel worked underground for four or five months holding meetings at fish fries and barbecues stealing into richmond once a week to study the terrain he had enlisted according to contemporary estimates from two thousand to fifty thousand slaves vesey who was by far the most astute of the slave rebels demonstrated a talent bordering on genius he worked undercover in charleston and environs for more than five years signing up whole plantations perfecting a celllike organization that was never cracked it has been estimated that more than nine thousand slaves were involved in his attempt to destroy slavery the three great slave revolts were in essence attempts to recreate community in rebellion turner prosser and vesey illuminated the chasm between man and man and man and state throwing their bodies across the great divide these three created a boundary situation a limiting moment of lucidity in which the master confronted traumatically the boundaries of freedom between man and man the implications of all this were clear enough and bad enough fearing a total conflagration men grew anxious and a language or rather a nonlanguage was invented to hold the terror that lived in mens hearts as the civil war approached slavery became to appropriate melvilles arresting metaphor a great white whale which threatened to devour both negroes and whites the long arm of slavery reached out and compromised the constitution which contained three proslavery clauses it blunted the force of jefferson and washington and twisted lincolns words in his mouth the slave experience is basic to an understanding of current racial realities it is the substructure of both segregation de facto and de jure and movements against segregation as a result of slavery whites were overwhelmed by a guilt so monstrous and pervading that it poisoned thought at its very roots another legacy of this period is a deep fear of the negro not a physical fear but something deeper and more menacing a fear of losing grip on life a fear of losing control and to this must be added the immense counterweight of negro embitterment the habit of regarding the state as an expression of the white personality the perfervid fascination with negro sex life the polarization of the north and south the noblesse oblige approach to negroes as suppliants seeking handouts rather than citizens with inalienable rights no man can bestow or withhold and above all the rupture in community between black man and white man and black man and the state all these are legacies of the slave substructure slavery in sum was a seed experience the significant dimensions of the race problem the special dynamism that gave the summers of and their special harshness are reflections of eddies that lie deep in the mind and deep in the past the negro is what he is today because he was once held in slavery by white people and white people are what they are today because they cannot forget because negroes will not let them forget what they did yesterday the most dramatic link with this substructure of remembered wrong is the image of the young student sittingin at a lunch counter reading hegel or aristotle and singing the same song that sustained his greatgrandmother in the slave cabins oh freedom oh freedom oh lord freedom over me and before vd be a slave id be buried in my grave an go home to my lord and be free the song and the students use of it tell us how much things have changed and how much they have remained the same even more significant is the fact that the song invokes something that transcends time and slaves and masters something that was honored in rome and athens and will be honored as long as man breathessomething in man that does not love walls and chains who needs negro digest with so many other magazines on the marketfrom the big slick picture magazines to the thin intellectual journalssuch a magazine as negro digest might appear almost irrelevant but who nowadays calls the negros aspirations writings thoughts and actions irrelevant this is what negro digest is all about negro digest is the only such magazine that frankly reveals what the people of color are doing saying and thinking as reflected in its articles essays general features short stories forums informational notes poetry and priceless humor negro digest provides an outlet for wellknownas well as the new and young articulate writers and thinkers and provides a source for those seeking negro historical facts guidance and information important to ones wellbeing perhaps this is why negro digest has been called the most stimulating magazine on the market by teachers housewives professionals and others who are aware in the true sense of the word who needs negro digest i not every person but then not every person dares to think honestly and creatively about shaping his own destiny improving the life of others or changing even a small corner of the world in which he lives such thoughts are too uncomfortable they have been known to start revolutions the dying beast of racism by louis e lomax racistsunless the victim is a major negro spokesman merit one paragraph on page of a nonsouthern daily a few pockets of resistance are left but the back of visible segregation has been broken and the reverend dr martin_luther_king jr has walked off with the top international peace accolade for having led the negrononviolently at thatto the waters edge of the american mainstream now that the season of pomp and circumstance has passed there is left the imperative and awesome if unspectacular miracle of reclaiming million negroes from the bonedeep effects of years of first slavery and then segregation just as awesome and unspectacular is the equally mandatory miracle of reclaiming the american white manhis heart soul and mindfrom the deep effects of having been first the slave owner and then the privileged majority in this historical tragedy if this republic uses its brain instead of its brawn its sense of history rather than its raw emotions then this will be the season of reclamation not recrimination true the race problem is far from solved just recently negroes and whites peered at each other over gun barrels in bogalusa la cores national director james farmer was leading his battalions including women and children to the firing lines martin_luther_king jr drew a bead on both los angeles and chicagochicago because of defacto school segregation and los angeles because that towns politicians had committed a monumental boondoggle that lost the community million in poverty fundsas his nonsouthern summer projects naacpers fanned out from their convention in denver to a half dozen southern states to conduct voter registration drives and the congress of the united states lurched inexorably forward to passage of the most sweeping voter rights bill in human history these isolated events many of them tinged with tragedy are but passing entries in the diary of the negro revolt they are skirmishes which future historians will study as final evidence of the racial madness that had it been left unchecked for another quarter of a century was about to destroy this nation but time call it god if that makes you more comfortable was on our side collectively we mortally wounded the monster as he grew from slumbering childhood into wildly destructive adolescence the violence in the streets then from bogalusa to harlem from los angeles to jackson miss is the last wild death romp and scream of the stricken beast of racism there will be blood and more blood pain and more pain nothing approaching normalcy is due this nation for yet another decade but the beast will die and when he does the same forces that combined to deliver the lethal blow must recommit and reassign themselves to the task of reclaiming the union from the effects of the beasts presence in this land since its inception the reclamation of the negro has already begun no less than a dozen government agencies are now totally involved with seeing to it that any negro with the guts and brains becomes and does whatever his talents say he can become and do i know of at least a half dozen private agencies that are totally committed to the same project todays negro does not lack for opportunity alas the precise opposite is the fact everywhere one goes one encounters white bankers industrialists and ordinary businessmen looking for instant negroes who can qualify for jobs as vice presidents electronics engineers and grayflannel junior executives negroesof all shapes sizes colors demeanors and varying mental abilitiesweve got of supernegroes however we have none that is to say the american negro on the whole is an underdeveloped people if the middleclass white home and business communities are to be used as norms then the negro community is a total disaster area you cant get bankers from a community of people who never saw a banker with whom they could identify you cant get electronic engineers out of broken homes in which whatever parent symbol is left neither reads nor writes and when the negro children gather among the broken glass in the alleys of rochester n y to discuss what they are going to be when they grow up it is very unlikely that one of them would name a profession he never hears of and which societyin its total impact upon him and at the age of has told him he cannot achieve because of his color even if he has heard of it and wishes to achieve it one of the major tasks then in the reclamation of the negro is to inform and motivate those youngsters who are still in grade school upon whom the evil days have not yet fully come nigh ordinary classroom teaching will not do it if he is in fifth grade the chances are he is already reading two levels below his white classmates and is beginning to dream of the day when he will grow a little bigger and can drop out nor can ordinary classroom teachers negro or white do the job they are too involved with curriculum standards flow charts and bellshaped curves that children from harlem and chicagos south side skew just by walking in the classroom no regular classrooms and career teachers cannot accomplish the needed miracle rather the negro communityevery church every empty store front that can be refurbished and every day school after the regular classes are donemust be converted into a beehive of basic education these youngsters need to be taught more than to read write and speak well they need blunt thorough courses in precisely who they are and why and they should be forced to realize just what opportunities await them if they will apply themselves that is the place the time and the methodthe only place time and method i submitto breed the negroes who in the process of realizing their individual potentials will reclaim the negro for america the schools i like to call them studyins should be manned by the devoted kind of educated civil_rights workers who deserted the halls of yale harvard bryn mawr and swarthmore to march on selma and to enter the peace corps there is a more pertinent role in the negro revolt for these dedicated youngsters than having their heads beaten and bloodied in the dying south their finest hours will be in the ghettoes ot the northand the south for that matternot on picket lines and in demonstrations but in special classrooms where negro youngsters are being readied to avail themselves of the opportunities that have been won at such great price not all negro youth will respond more accurately most of them will not but as quiet as it is kept most white kids dont respond to the professional challenge either most white people are simple ordinary folks and that is what most negroes will turn out to be this then is the second major move toward the reclamation of the negro the american negro has never enjoyed the right to be ordinary if a negro steals it is a commentary upon his race if a white man steals he is just a bad fellow by the same token and as a result of the same racist logic the negro has never been able to get the ordinary jobs that keep the majority of the nations white citizens cloaked in security and dignity the wealthy and the professionals are not the economic backbone of the republic it is the ordinary workerthe clerk the welder the fireman the policeman the bartender the realestate salesman the plumber the automobile mechanicwho form that american phenomenon in the lower middle class and keep the national economy moving the lower middle class are ordinary people in ordinary jobs and the negro encounters more difficulty crashing that circle than he does the enclaves of the professionals and the rich this is why the median annual income of the average negro family is some less than that of the white family and the gap is getting wider my own view is that entrance of the negro into the american lower middle class is the key issue the strategist for the negro revolution must deal with sitins have created negro opportunity but nothing short of studyins can make these opportunities become breadandbutter realities i realize i have spoken of the reclamation almost solely in economic terms but that is the american jargon that is the way of life in the country to which the negro is committed both by history and temperament i am the first to admit that change stirs in the american way of life perhaps as the new left suggests a new kind of economic thinking is in the making but the task before the negro revolutionaries is to prepare the negro to participate in what is the better he may participate in what will be conscience of a black conservative by preston dewitt wiley sr wisest amo vf if race understand j the mere agitation of rather than us be honest questions of social equality is the ex extremest folly and that progress in the enjoyment of all privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle artificial forcing let no race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized american negroes must be free the nation agrees to that but the vigorous dr martin_luther_king jr and other negro leaders should stop merely urging their followers to protest march and demonstrate in the streets and start an enlightened campaign supporting not just social but economic viability among the black people an efficient organization and a determined application of negro intelligence towards his own deliverance and security are needed to make democracy workable in this country needed to make the negro influential in the american mainstream while the aim of civil_rights demonstrations was and is a necessary aim it is a fact of human nature that goals can be lost sight of and tactics glorified more than objective it seems reasonable to suggest that while a broad spectrum of public opinion one which embraces a majority of the congress and the white house supports specific legislation aimed against social injustice continued street demonstrations have an air of shoddy anachronism about them it is not easy to see why the importance of incentives and escalated productivity are so murky to overall negro leadership what i mean here is that the negro zeitgeist is blown up by its own bomb to base its policy primarily on protest equality cannot be legislated it must be gained by character and achievement a negro leadership which attempts to fulfill the constitution by keeping the negro from losing faith in freedom as the way of civilization is sagacious rather than combative however this leadership usually supplies no workable programs to help solve the negroes complaints the bible says somewhere that where there is no vision the people perish i am not preaching black nationalism when i point out that the economic status of the negro is not wholly contingent upon the will of the controlling white majority and that negroes are in danger of becoming a people of professional beggers but no one can complain forever let us deserve to be great if a measure of the money and energy that has been spent in trying to effect legislation to assure equality for the black people i love so much had been spent on economiceducational programs to help prepare them for civic responsibilities perhaps the situation we face in alabama new york and mississippi would be on the road to solution the latent talents of millions of young negro americans must be recognized encouraged and developed so as to provide them with a firm base in the nations economy and social order without such a base it is unrealistic to pretend that negroes can sustain the political and social rights which belong to them with the precision that made the march on wallaces state capital so successful let negro leaders now turn their attention to employment housing and education the three great areas where fundamental improvement is crucial to the negros progress to my way of thinking the health of our economy requires escalated negro productivity and a growing sense of negro responsibility one of the negros biggest handicaps has been his failure to understand and use economic and political leverage but the advantage of a positive policy by negro leadership is that it has the advantage of equipping negroes to compete the negro community should bear in mind that the greater society they aspire to will be dominated by economics again let us be honestabsolute equality is a goal that will probably never be attained that is an ideal not of this world however the administrations great society advocates are correct in the assumption that a social order can be created in which each section of the national community can justly feel that it is in no way exploited by the otherfor every great society must ultimately be genuinely constructive all of its members must have a stake in its existence the health of our economy also requires a growing number of negro businesses and a growing number of negro home owners hence the crisis in negro selfreliant enterprisewith only per cent of all american negroes selfemployed or in a managerial capacity compared with per cent for white workers the need for cohesion in the negro community is seen as essential to organized negro initiative and enterprise while i am not unmindful that historically the ambitious negro has been held down by a lack of education less access to the money market limited experience community segregation and invisible barriers thrown up by trade and fraternity organizations the fact remains paradoxically that there is a great deal more the negro could do to help himself the cry of uncle tom is positive proof of this two roads are open to negroes one for those who recoil from hard effort cavil at challenge who reject competition and would like to leave the shape of their future to programs subsidized by the federal government in their timidity and lack of vision such negroes declare the problems confronting them virtually insoluble to private effort brushing aside for the moment questions of free enterprise and expediency would such a program alone equip negroes to openly compete it is doubtful the other road is harder to tread at first it demands clear sight concern with means as well as ends and without going into technical details hereproduction planning perspective and cohesion in the negro community above all else we negroes are free to choose and we shall be responsible for our choice before history selfishnesssuccess self sacrificesuicide by dr leo louis martello ince time immemorial s man black and white f has been blackmailed into believing that self ishness is a vice that selfsacrifice is a virtue in the case of the negro in america deprived of his civil and more important human rights it would be more proper to call it white blackmail the little white lies consist of the following triumvirate faith force and fraud faith of the whitetaught negro converts meant his being blackmailed by the bible the christcross was used as a club to clobber his consciousness and selfrespect the ideal of all true believers a passive sissified christ nothing could be further from the truth christ was a man of courage of conviction who defied the conventions of his time he wasnt a martyr he was murdered quite a difference he defied his family his friends the high priests and the ruling romans turn the other cheek he was killed because he didnt the only time you should turn the other cheek is to get yourself into a better position to give your antagonist a good punch in the nose dont be bullied by a false interpretation of the bible the meek shall inherit the earth has bamboozled minority groups for centuries into submission the worst part of this is that it is an incorrect translation the language of christ was aramaic in which the words meek and wise are written the same the only way one can tell what meaning is meant is by the voice inflection or sentence structure scholars unfamiliar with this fact mistranslated the wise shall inherit the earth into the meek all tyrants extol the virtues of faith since they cant possibly back it up by any facts when faith didnt work they used force murder torture violence lynchings terror what is seldom said though is that the victim is more morally to blame than the victimizer he has accepted without challenge the dogma of selfsacrifice he has permitted his enemy to rob him of the only weapon he has for survival his mind his intellect has been anaesthetised into believing that any claim to his rights any positive selfassertion any display of a healthy ego is wrong he is in conflict with himself a man divided is easily conquered the negros greatest battle today is not in the realm of civil_rights it is within the realm of himself those who are most militant in their demand for equal rights no matter how just must make sure that this stems from a sense of justice and not from a desire for revenge every man black or white needs a sense of egoidentity if as a child he is made to believe that he is inferior he will grow up believing this he will either passively accept it and fail as a human being or aggressively and defensively fight his secret feelings about himself and become like those who made him that way what he needs to do most is challenge his own secret feelings not facts about himself no one is born with feelings of inferiority or superiority these are acquired during the formative years from unthinking adults not having the capacity to reason the child passively accepts other peoples estimates of himself he will live up to the image expected of him he will seek out those who are compatible with his own low selfesteem he forms unions of mutual contempt unable to respect himself he cant respect anyone else filled with selfloathing he perpetuates by word and deed the image of himself fostered on him by morally and intellectually bankrupt guardians or superiors this is the crime this is the tragedy even after and if he was granted all his civil_rights furnishing an outer target for attack giving him some selfrespect as a man he may be left with a vast emptiness why because he has failed to claim his right to himself he must recognize that all the evil committed against him as a negro or any other minority group is not a reflection on him as a man but on the unmanliness of the perpetrators as a child he didnt know any better didnt possess the intellectual equipment to block such impressions but as a man he does the terrible thing here is that so many try to claim their rights as men motivated by their feelings as children their passive acceptance their unconscious secret feelings of inferiority give moral sanction to their destroyers the public spectacle of fighting for their rights has less value collectively and individually than the private one of regaining the positive selfimage which is every mans birthright positive selfishness doesnt mean the popular conception of the parasite the plunderer the thinking only of himself at anothers expense it does mean independence dignity that no man has the right to ask you to sacrifice yourself for his interests or his to yours it means your right to refuse an unjustified request without guilt it means claiming your rights when you know that you are right and not letting yourself be imposed upon by the demands of others those who use deception in putting one over on the man are neither smart nor selfish they are selfless they are playing into the hands of their enemy living up to his image of them as unreliable youve got to watch them every minute if they had any sense of self they wouldnt furnish this kind of ammunition to a bigot true selfishness that is morally right means never sacrificing your selfrespect never compromising yourself for an immediate gain never doing anything either for a favor or as a favor but only because its in your best interest theres one thing that no man can give you no man can take away from you your selfrespect any time you accept less than what you know is your due any time you play along or permit someone to take unfair advantage any time you lay down your weapons you have no right to cry unfair its the same as the victim giving his executioner the gun that will kill him your greatest weapon is your mind your positive selfishness your dignified conduct as a human being this is the only way you can fight the bigoted enemy with his own ammunition like it or not he is forced to deal with you man to man the only criterion in your dealings being value for value an epitaph for nonviolence by dr nathan hare artly because of the j tfti l way wich nonvio vr f lence has been misused by negro leaders in the united states there are signs that that doctrine at least as we have known it up to nowis slowly but surely on its way out of the negros struggle these signs include the los angeles riots in which a violent form of civil disobedience or active resistance erupted in excess of the harlem case the year before then there are the deacons for defense and justice now emerging in the deep south the tolerance and treatment given the deacons by the press is in contrast to the persecution of robert williams and his lieutenants who sought to use violence in self defense in monroe north carolina some years ago however there are indications that the deacons are not as consistently radical as they may seem for example in a laudatory magazine article recently a picture showed them helping louisiana cops corral and control negroes but it is still a step in the direction of violence has given a measure of respectability to the use of retaliatory violence by negroes and helped to establish a new standard of militancy as a matter of fact only recently although after this article had been conceived a sncc leader revealed unsolicited by me that his group is dropping nonviolence for the most part because negroes in southern localities where they are being killed by whites no longer want to listen to a nonviolent ideology that is one of the main reasons he explained that martin_luther_king is moving his campaign to the north even there king may encounter difficulty dick gregory was shot in the leg when he tried to control los angeles watts negroes and being in los angeles at the time i even heard a middle class negro remark that they should have shot martin_luther_king in a certain portion of his anatomy this not only indicates a rejection of unilateral nonviolence it also reflects a budding inclination for negroes to choose their own leaders instead of merely accepting those approved and promoted by the white power structure and its press let us then consider the reasons behind the emerging disenchantment with nonviolence as we have known it so far one is that nonviolence has largely failed to bring a significant amount of measurable equality while there have been some conspicuous gains the negro has not progressedin spite of propaganda to the contraryin the manner that he must if he is to obtain equality in the next one thousand years my analysis of census data shows that while negroes gained occupationally during the forties when they were needed in war industries to replace job vacancies left by white soldiers they did not gain during the fifties in spite of the supreme court decree and the passive resistance movement negroes obtained some middle class tokenism the order of the day in every sphere including symbolic jobs such as air line stewardess symphony orchestra base fiddler and so forth but statistically as a group they did not gain on whites during the fifties the negro did move up some from his past position owing to changes in the economy but whites moved up faster maintaining the previous gap a census economist has found that the negros income is only about per cent of that of whites much similar to the ratio a half century ago in the area of school desegregation in the south more than nine out of ten negro students still attend segregated schools now more than ten years after the supreme court decreed desegregation with all deliberate speed border states have moved ahead with desegregation only to slip back into resegregation with previously allwhite schools swiftly becoming allnegro even in the north such cities as new york which at least three years ago had only one negro school principal philadelphia and chicago have about as much or more de facto segregation in the schools as they did in the year of the supreme court decision ironically aimed at the south studies at the population research center the university of chicago have revealed that there was no significant decrease in the amount of spatial or residential segregation in us cities during the fifties in fact chicago had the highest index of spatial segregation of any city in the world including southern cities south africa and the castes of india eleven oclock sunday morning is still the most segregated hour of the week nine out of ten negroes belong to allnegro denominations and most of the rest attend allnegro church houses prayins have failed to penetrate those earthly gates to heaven although more lipservice and in a few cases active participation was obtained from white preachers who left their allwhite churches now and then as in the selma march to join the negros civil_rights struggle as a matter of fact i for one was never more appalled than when five years after the montgomery bus boycott a greyhound bus carrying freedom riders through montgomery was attacked and burned in the first place i had been riding the front of the bus local as well as interstate practically all my life in oklahoma texas and missouri admittedly as some friends have pointed out that was not alabama but i do not believe that the difference would have occurred to me then my negro friends did not believe me even then except when they happened to see me in which case whites would look at me like i was crazy and negroes would look at me like i was crazy then head straight for the back sometimes mumbling such things as just want to start some trouble or just acting a fool i remember when i was ten years old holding up a bus which ran from bristow to beggs oklahoma for thirty minutes while the driver sought to persuade me to move to the back in a larger place the police would probably have moved me by force but in that small locality everybody knew that my mother would have come for them with her shotgun had they laid a finger on me anyway my policy ever after was never to move rear of center even if i had to stand while seats were vacant in the rear but drivers would roll their eyes at me and i would roll mine back at them and nobody bothered me except once that day i sat down beside a white farmer who had on dirty overalls i returning from a testing center where i had taken the graduate record examination was dressed in coat and tie the white farmer said to me why dont you go to the back where you belong i told him why dont you put me back there i had just won a golden gloves championship in oklahoma and was anxious to try out a recently perfected left hook but i could not aggravate him into saying anything else but enough of my personal experiences the important difference was that i was acting as an individual and any rebellion to be successfulwhether nonviolent or violentmust be a collective enterprise and is no better than its degree of organization however i used to wonder what would have been the impact if a majority of negroes had been refusing to conform even as individuals to the souths policies of segregation why then is nonviolence failing in the united states aside from the fact that it is unnatural to mans makeup most negroes have never taken part in a nonviolent demonstration and say that they could not remain nonviolent under fire nonviolence has been carried out in a hypocritical and dogmatic fashion many negroes instinctively realize that it is utterly american to fight back when attacked and they know that it is lawful even to kill a man in self defense negroes have been socialized into that cultural norm and are coming to see the curious contrast between nonviolence for them and the customarily unpunished killing of negroes including army majors in uniform by white southerners it is easy in this context to discern the inconsistency if not the hypocrisy of martin_luther_kings statement in his stride toward freedom that it is immoral for negroes to fight back when attacked by southern whites but that us efforts to violently deter an ideology such as communism is another thing incidentally king himself as told in the same book went down to apply for a pistol permit when his life was threatened during the montgomery boycott mind you the growing number of persons who question nonviolence have nothing against it as a tactic or strategem they merely believe that it should stay on that plane be put to use when that seems proper but abandoned when obviously ineffective and unjust the dogmatic approach to nonviolence heretofore is a result some say of the prevalence of negro preachers in the movement and the fact that negroes have tended to demonstrate a capacity or inclination to make everything a religion or pseudoreligion the new negro militants point to the fact that the oppressors justify the use of violence and even demand that negroes take part in wars of violence against persons who have never harmed them personally even a mississippi freedom democratic party bulletin has pointed to this paradox many negroes recall public school textbook accounts of the boston tea party where colonists with grievances boarded a ship and chopped up a supply of tea this brought up to date would be tantamount to a negro chopping up a lunch counter the new negro militant admires in the way that most americans are taught to do the speech of patrick henry when he stood and said give me liberty or give me death if a negro should stand and say that they would probably give him death the new negro militant familiar with history recalls the holy hell of the holy crusades when primitive christians took up the sword and used violence to persuade others to adopt a policy of nonviolenceto turn the other cheek then later while the negro was turning the other cheek they were kicking him on his other two and yet those persons now beginning to flirt with a philosophy of violence still reveal that they prefer a nonviolent approach accordingly as revealed in an esquire article the red chinese american negroes by william worthy a year or two ago they aim to squeeze the last drop of hope out of nonviolence and the similar though contrary to popular fallacy not equivalent tactic civil disobedience i should point out that many of the negroes that worthy one of the most militant negro journalists described as red chinese american negroes felt that he had sold them out linking their cause with the hated red chinese who lack respectability and approval in america and suggesting by implication as whites are inclined to do that negroes do not have native sense enough to structure their own rebellion but must always be moved by some other group anyway these negroes are beginning to advocate that we must forsake the kind of token civil disobedience we have known before and prepare for a policy of total civil disobedience the concept of total civil disobedience is synonymous with the general strike proposed by the classical social theorist georges sorel in reflections on violence james meredith while at the university of mississippi ole miss apparently came across sorels work he proposed a general strike but being misseducated pun intended thought that it meant negroes should designate a day and take off fifteen minutes from work however this is not even the equivalent of a coffee break what sorel meant by his general strike and what the slowly growing number of new negro militants have in mind is more extreme to use a favorite adjective of the white press the new negro militants propose that negroes passively resist participation in wars to preserve democracy so long as their government does not guarantee them democracy in their own land as a mississippi freedom democratic partys bulletin recently did refuse in the manner of the american colonists to pay the tax they owe so long as they do not have equal representation possibly refuse to work in the manner of south african negroes in the strike boycott the downtown area altogether stallin cars turn on water faucets and let them run put sand in the sewers and in general refuse to cooperate they long to bring this society to a halt to jeopardize its economy against negro rights and to let the world know that negroes will no longer obey or cooperate with a hypocritical and morally decadent society this attitude has occasionally infiltrated even civil_rights workers the march on washington for example had to be taken over by the white power structure who put moderate leaders such as martin_luther_king and roy wilkins according to an item in the washington post at its helm originally planned as a true march on washington to liein congress and tieup the capitols functions it became instead a jolly parade in washington with orderliness as its goal the white power structure told negroes how to march and when to leave a sncc leaders speech was censored so that a white catholic archbishop would agree to take part the proposed stallins before the worlds fair in new york came to an even more abortive fate as national leaders pushed by white contributions and control condemned the tactic as going too far the negro revolution is then unique in terms of world history in that white oppressors are allowed to tell negroes how and when to rebel new negro militants complain however the switch away from nonviolence is only dimly in sight in the first place talk always precedes revolution as it is necessary first that an oppressed group come to realize that a true revolution is essential this is occurringand will become more extreme in the futureas negroes increasingly reveal the other prerequisite for revolution a loss of faith in the feasibility of routine conventional means for righting the wrongs they suffer if it continues to seem necessary that negroes turn from token civil disobedience to total civil disobedience new negro militants are inclined to approach it with a hope for nonviolence but when and if they are met with violence let the chips fall where they may a white american faces his dilemma by ken jon booth three months of ira g the year that im away i from my classroom in denver i spend be hind the whed of a jolly jerry ice cream truck as i daily dispense bubble gum and ice cream bars i drive through neighborhoods with which im not familiar several days ago as i pulled up to the curb at the hail of a three year old my mind was busy with the guessing game that always follows is this little one a customer or does he merely want to pass the time of day for the ice cream man is every childs friend i was in luck for the young fellow finally managed to communicate the idea that he wanted the one with peanuts deciphering such a message is something of a feat i can understand my own all right but other peoples three year olds often are a mystery just as id wrapped the little fellows fingers around his change and admonished him to scoot home to mama before he lost it i looked up into a face that looked inquiringly at me didnt you go to north the young handsome man asked me i answered that i had and then recognized mike we shook hands warmly and exchanged last names which wed both forgotten mike was visiting denver from his new home in california after hed gotten the ice cream hed come for i invited him to visit me at my home while he was in town in fact i quite nearly insisted mike agreed to call the next time he was in town we said goodbye and probably will never meet again with one exception there is nothing strange about our meeting it can hardly be called a reunion for we hardly know one another the exception is this why should i have invited a school acquaintance i hadnt seen in ten years to my home and be so adamant about his acceptance why should i have been so much more delighted at seeing mike again than i would normally be about seeing an old acquaintance considering it i can find only two reasons and one of them makes me a little more than ashamed if mike has done any thinking about the matter then i should do well to be humiliated the lesser of the two reasons is that when we were in high school together i did like mike in our infrequent encounters the second reason has to do with such mixed and complex factors that they are far too easily summed up in saying it is because mike and i live in two different worlds and i feel guilty about it reflecting upon our meeting it seems to me that my effusive good will must have been a disappointment to mike for until then he possibly thought our differing colors meant nothing to me that of course is the impression i always seek to give for i have been told over and over again from childhood that the negro is very sensitive to any notice being taken of his color im sure my mother meant well in fostering that idea but it in no way changes the fact that such a thing is the rankest hypocrisy who but a blind man can fail to notice that someone is male or female black or white even so it is a part of my upbringing that cannot be erased from my subconscious at this late date therefore to me the negro will always be sensitive about color in connection with this i was taught that to inflict discomfort in any wayor to hurt anyones feelings was the vilest act of callous cruelty that could be done to anyone therefore my subconscious being an obedient thing to its teachings i must bend two fold backwards to avoid taking any note of mikes or anyone elses color isnt that foolish it is more than that it is pitiful yes pathetic if you will for it means that throughout my life i am completely helpless in establishing any sort of valid relationship with any member of a race other than my own i will be so afraid of offending or hurting someone that i will remain a sycophant always seeking to say and do the right thing ive kept these ideas out of my mind until recently for it is not a pleasant thing to admit to oneself that he is one of the very devils he has been trying to slay thinking back however i can trace the pattern easily my first contact with a negro was in an elevator in new york and in all innocence i told the gentleman your face is dirty and your mother will be angry with you i dont remember if the man smiled or answered for the shocked and horrible silence in the car filled with white people instantly informed me that i had committed a crime of some sort but i hadnt my own mother god rest her had she had never acknowledged the fact that there are peoples of different colors on earth to me any skin that wasnt white was in need of cloth and soap nothing was ever said about the incident but i have never forgotten it also the black man has fascinated me ever since just before world war ii we lived in pennsylvania and i began school in pittsburgh one of my playmates was a boy named sammy sammy was not a white boy but i had learned by that time that his face wasnt dirty mother had even gone further before i was enrolled at the school she had told me very patiently now kenneth there will be negro children in your school some people dont like them and are mean and hateful to them i dont ever want you to be unkind treat them just like you would anyone else now stop and reread that quotation which i can still hear twenty some years later the ears of a child are sharp and the senses of adults tend to dim but reading and hearing it again now i see an implication in those words so deadly that it is difficult to be charitable even to mothers good intentions for that bit of preschool advice carries with it so clearly the thought that you little white boy must be kind to these lesser beings now what ever gave that dear lady the idea that a child left to himself would treat one child differently from another what is the phrase unless ye become as little children i was a dutiful child when i struck up a boyish friendship with sammy i brought him home from school with me we had cookies and milk in the kitchen with mothers blessing that is until she walked into the kitchen poor mother what a look on her face she must have been thinking will this child of mine never stop taking everything i say literally its to mothers credit that she didnt mention the incident but then she didnt have to although i continued to play with sammy we did so on the playground and at his house for his mother never made me feel unwanted now that was in except for mike who i knew as a nodding friend in the halls at school and as a fellow entertainer i knew no one else of another race until i entered the university of missouri at kansas city in in kansas city i came to face the facts that denver is not representative of the relationship between white and black in denver there was a time when negroes sat in the back of the streetcar sat only in the theater balcony and did not visit the amusement parks or swimming pools gradually over the years the situation changed there is no longer any obvious segregation in denver what segregation there is is a subtle thing about which i know too little to speak the situation in kansas city then was something of a shock to me the university custodian constantly embarrassed me by calling me mr and sir he was i believe what is known as an uncle tom no amount of entreaty could change his subservience to me never would he call me by my first name as i asked him and he was forever doing demeaning tasks which were unpleasant for him and which i could and should have done for myself i must have tried to outwit that old man a hundred times but no matter where i hid my dirty ash trays he found and washed them no matter where i tucked away my lunch leftovers anticipating an opportunity later to dispose of them the old fox extricated them and bore them away with a smile i constantly expected him to break into a chorus of ov man river and beneath it all i knew he would see me in hell with no regret if ever the day came so it was i discovered bervin bervin was one of the crack debaters on the umkc championship team and we were in the same area of study taking my courage in my hands i arranged an accidental meeting between us one afternoon in my office it is the only time in my life that i dared to discuss the problem openly although the amount of time it took me to get warmed up and to the point must have been a trial for him the next few weeks were spent listening to bervin and asking questions but the most pressing question he couldnt answer and i havent been able to answer it satisfactorily myself what shall i do what is my part in this bervin did not know i think i do know but it is little comfort to me for the part i am able to play is so minutely small that its effect cannot be measured for years and it may by then be too late i can do about all that i am able to only by being honest with those negroes with whom i come in contact and by allowing my children to grow up without acquiring my prejudices i dont try to turn my daughter and sons against parsnips just because i dont think they are fit for human consumption have i any more right to influence my children in their reactions to other people so obvious a rhetorical question needs no answer very well then my job is to be the best father i can and to be honest one sunday while sitting with core at the kc liberty memorial i thought about this part that i can play it is not enough being a good father is a basic responsibility and duty sitting with core does not end hatred what is there for me to do ive asked this of many people but mostly of myself bervins answer was this theres nothing for you to do this is not your fight it is ours you can help by keeping out of the way youre a teacher arent you well then thats your job thats where you can help you cant change things by standing in front of your class and preaching against the outrageous things that have happened and are happening the only thing you can do is just what youve told me you try to do with your students to make them think and to make them seek truth in all things and bervin is perhaps right if i can make a few begin their searches for truth and to think well eventually come out all right prejudice and hatred exist where they are born in ignorance and fear but how many generations of my children must be bom and live and die before the stain has been erased from their minds how many more little children must die in church basements how many more must be cursed spat on and killed before all of our consciences can bear no more the negro is not the only one who suffers in this time of struggle and terror the bitter white suffers of fear and horror just as real the white who neither hates nor knows suffers indirectly from being deprived of what the two races together could achieve and as for me and those like me we suffer guilt and impotent rage because our own futile petty attempts to redress wrongs are far greater than our powers to cure them jc but from my ice cream truck i see hope true it is not a very great hope and its road ahead is a very long one but it has begun the hands that reach for my ice cream are black and white and tan and countless other hues they dont care who stands next to them nor who is first in line as long as turns are taken their purchases completed they return to playing in their yards with one another we have slowly come this far but i smile to myself as i drive through the streets for even with the for sale signs in groups and strips of tens and twelves the inevitable has happened billy has hit johnny with a fast right hook and their mothers talk it out over the back fence it isnt too impressive perhaps but what mother in the world would deny johnnys friend bill a place at the birthday table am i naive to think then that the way is before us am i but grasping at straws in my own desperation to spare my children from living with unfounded hatreds by believing that billy and johnny will always be friends when they have been neighbors as children i think not no i think not for all of our follies our blunders our stupidities and pettiness we yet remain that wonderful creature as ugly as he is beautiful as loving as he is brutal man and as long as we are part of man we must progress to better times and worlds i know i am mouthing the ideas of the people who maintain that we must let things alone and they will turn out all right i also know the young negro and white today do not want to leave things alone things should be made right and it must be done now youth has always thought so if it didnt we would still be a colony of england and even then there were those who said let us live side by side with the british and we will be friends but it did not happen a war was inevitable and only after it was foughtafter the blood was shed and many died and many tears fell into our souls and soildid we find the things which had bound us together all along the fact that we all were men if it must come to that let the time come soon so that we may at last get down to useful purposes and build together in the meantime be charitable and give us a moment in your thought we who are intruders in a world we have not seen and do not know and are drawn by that mutual bond of humanity and yet must ever remain bound to our pasts as a turtle to his shell how heavy those shells become at times and how we long to free ourselves from them how to open corporate jobs to qualified negroes by dr andrew f brimmer many corporaw tions are making an effort to recruit nesr es for management positions the success so far has been only marginal this result has come about partly because of the general lack of technical preparation on the part of most minority group members for the specific job opportunities which exist at the managerial level and partly because corporate managers are usually recruited at the junior level and advance on the basis of internally acquired experience clearly if the objective is to quicken the rate at which managerial opportunities for minority group members are opened this is a selfdefeating system thus some method must be found to increase the momentum while i along with everybody else have no panacea to recommend the following approach appears to be promising although few negroes currently possess the technical skills most in demand by corporations a relatively large number of negro college graduates have acquired educational and employment experience in fields not wholly removed from general administration among such fields are public and educational administration law mathematics insurance real estate and the social sciences for example in there were about nonwhites who had four or more years of college work of this about were classified as professional technical and kindred workers and approximately were managers officials and proprietors today these numbers are undoubtedly larger while the vast majority of these nonwhite college graduates are probably uninterestedor unpreparedto pursue a career in corporate management a substantial number may well find this attractive the big question ishow to convert such welleducated professionals into potential corporate managers as noted above initial entry in virtually every case is at the beginning levels which carry salaries too low to appeal to most non white college graduates with professional experience on the other hand the salaries earned by the great majority of nonwhite college graduates are by no means double the typical beginning salary paid to management trainees by corporations this fact seems to point to a promising vehicle to attract more nonwhites into corporate enterprise for example if an arrangement could be devised which would permit professionals with basically sound training in the social sci ences public administration and related areas to devote one year to a specialized graduate course in business administration a fairly large number might be able to make the transition into the corporation and assume responsibilities at the intermediate level in a number of areas a few fields seem especially promising eg personnel administration public relations marketing research and advertising with more investigation other areas may also be identified if such a plan were considered its feasibility would turn heavily on the solution of at least two basic issues in the first place the average negro professional already established in a relatively secure although perhaps lowpaying position may be reluctant to abandon his present spot to return to graduate school and then risk the problem of finding a job in an entirely new field thus it may well be necessary for a fairly large number of corporations to identify in advance a group of minority group college graduates with managerial potential these corporations might then have to commit themselves to providing a job opportunityat least on a trial basisfor the successful candidates to start after the oneyear training period secondly financial resources would have to be found on a fairly large scale to support the oneyear retraining experience while corporations themselves may well find it desirable to provide a portion of these funds it seems more likely that one of the leading foundations may consider this a worth while project while no firm estimate of the cost of such a project even on a modest scale can be provided several bench mark figures seem reasonable as a minimum one might want to avoid imposing a severe burden on the candidates family during the year of graduate study in the median income for nonwhite professionals in the social sciences was about thus a stipend between and per candidate for one year may well be sufficient to attract a fairly large number of highly qualified applicants if it is assumed that tuition and other overhead would add about to the sum required per candidate may well be between and thus to launch the program with candidates would require an expenditure of to in terms of the magnitude of many foundationsupported programs this sum is by no means out of the ordinary while such a program would clearly be a modest beginning it would be a beginning on a systematic basis its benefits would extend well beyond those derived by the individual candidates who would improve their immediate employment positions and by the corporations who would obtain competent employees the program would also demonstrate to minority group young people that expanding job opportunities in the corporate sector are a reality they could see in a relatively short period of time a growing number of members of minority groups actually acquiring managerial positions in corporations this visibility would have a feedback effect and would help to raise and reorient the aspirations of minority group youth it would also stimulate the revision and improvement of curricula at predominantly negro schools which increasingly would begin to prepare graduates to enter upon managerial careers along the ordinary routes established by corporations an examination of mission work in africa by wilton sankawulo image of the mism sionary in africa like indeed that westerner is to define thing the coming of the missionary into africa was contemporary with the coming of european political power which was drastic revolting and of course rewarding in many ways the missionary has unfortunately been classed with the politicians as imperialists by some africans their influence as a whole is suspect and the africans have been trying to remove what they believe to be unjust about it trying to be free from it wherever the question of injustice arises objectivity towards any particular problem is likely to be lost for the struggle for right like that of any cause is hard to be restrained from sacrificing even what is good in order to attain its goal the image of the missionary in particular presents a special problem for mission work is based on a theory of sacrificial selfgiving and the theological concept of human brotherhood reasonably enough anyone who cares about being realistic will admit readily that mission work more than any other foreign institution has made the most significant contribution to the development of africa im speaking in terms of the qualitativeand not primarily the quantitativeextent of it the mission work involves the whole man body mind and spirit this is principally the only reason for any success it may have but the fact that lutheran mission work for example could operate in liberia for a period of one century statistically producing about christians suggests that its success is not commensurate with the time the money and the effort invested into it the reason for this may be apparent in many ways or practically hidden to everyone it means that it is time for some reconsideration some analysis examining what mission work is like today and perhaps what it ought to be but it is a difficult if not exceedingly risky thing to do most missionaries at least from my experience and those supporting mission work would consider it reckless and ungrateful if an african man should do it but as plato said an unexamined life is not worth living and so it is only by running ultimate risks that one can look at things objectively discovering faults where they lie hoping to bring about improvement what missionaries are accused of today which is supposed to be a deterrent factor in mission work one that they themselves are first in admitting is the iconoclastic attitude they have somehow used and are using against african culture the question of imposing their culture has become a profound subject of protest to the africans this arises chiefly from a nationalistic spirit tinged with the africans quest to be free and to be himself selfacceptance is one basis for improvement where the self is denied something of a caricature emerges to represent it and because a caricature is not true to the self it misrepresents it destroys it ive met some africans who paradoxically deny their tribal origins even refuse to speak or write tribal dialects for them improvement means adopting a western identity but then the true self is selfwilled and will never easily yield to a foreign identity and so they have to surrender all the claims their origins have upon them and live with an identity not very clear to them this is painful ive seen many such africans deny their parents because they lived in the tribal tradition and the tragedy of this is that western society will not accept them on equal termsperhaps because they have very little in common misplaced and rootless they live by an illusion which they know as an illusion but they work restlessly in making themselves believe that the illusion is truth the amount of damage this can do to the self and the social problems it creates are unlimited it was the danger of this inescapable fact that persuaded missionaries and africans alike to believe that something peculiar of africa must be retained in her contacts with the rest of the world culturally religiously and politically most african writers and politicians would call this the african personality what this personality is what it should be is not known to everyone most africans i know take it to be the traditional way of living excluding everything that has to do with the west or the east but of course these africans would not stop using electricity spoons plates clothes cars etc made in usa to them who go so far with the west and still raise the question of their own uniqueness i would say you are raising this question in order to create conflicts of ideas and feelings for youre no different from a westerner in your mode of living african writers who are the intellectual supporters of this personality would write about the rain pelting on the jungle leaves the beauty of the gods the ancestral spirits and the mystery surrounding everything in africa not simply as things that exist but as the ideal things that exist for the africans this is perhaps why westerners today say lets leave them and their ways we shouldnt impose our ways upon them for they are too technical and advanced for them all they see now the best that can be done out of a bad job is to preserve africa as an area where they could go to study primitive tribes when they want to write new books in anthropology this is exactly what esther warner meant when she said that all missionaries ought to be anthropologists but if the missionary is in africa merely to accept things as they are without effecting any change then what is he doing there the african personality defined in this manner is completely reckless it remains a glorious mythas ezekiel mphahlele puts it it is a way of closing your eyes to what the rest of the world is doing change is the basis of all advancements even the west passed through the age in which evil was checked by exercising witches other ways more realisticthough not necessarily more successful as human nature is still the same had to be devised to handle the problem of evil to burn a man at the stake for instance because he differs with the popular belief is no more a common practice in the west when i advocate change here i dont mean blind adoption of western culture the chinese culture is very different from the western one but one cannot say as a rule that the western dish is better than the chinese dish if there should be a personality peculiar of africa in any way it must be one that will grow one that will relate itself with the rest of the world because africa is a part of the world it is exceedingly unrealistic to explain things in terms of african reality alone the time has passed for one social class to consider only those of similar attributes and persuasion as friends branding all others as foe merely because they are different as the animals in george orwells animal farm tried to do consequently i want the african personality that will in the first place accept its own heritage and fearlessly eliminate elements in it that are archaic and useless in coping with modern reality our music for instance could be organized analyzed and developed in its own right to the point where it would make its own impact on the world we need our bachs our beethovens we cant be satisfied with mere mediocrity our writers should stop praising the jungle its wild life and superstitions as though they constitute the apex of our civilization we cannot convince ourselves that this kind of life is all we need because the high rate of death the fear and insecurity superstitions bring together with the erosive havoc of ignorance disease and poverty all bear witness to how much we have to do on the other hand enthusiastic converts should never condemn the african traditions as a whole we have to accept our past with the idea of making improvement on it not for building a false monument to it or destroying it i want the african personality that will not be afraid to borrow from any quarters whether east or west in order to strengthen itself to enrich itself we must never imagine that there is a pure culture in the world just as we should never imagine a pure race western culture is not purely western it borrowed from every other culture western philosophy for example has some elements of the thoughts of confucius as well as maotsetung and some historians and anthropologists are united in saying that western civilization began on the shores of africa i would not hold it against missionaries for that matter when they attempt to put a stop to most of the superstitions and the primitive ways of living they encounter in africa all of this is not primarily done from selfish motives and it is our responsibility to correct where the intention has gone astray if we can face this as a fact if missionaries accept themselves as human and therefore fallible it is only then can mission work succeed in producing positive effects in africa james baldwin has said any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known it the loss of all that gave one an identity the end of safety it is only when a man is able without bitterness or selfpity to surrender a dream he has long possessed that he is set freehe has set himself freefor higher dreams for greater privileges the only thing that would justify the agony of change and make it bearable is an adequate reason for bearing it at all what most missionaries have not cared about doing is giving adequate reasonsthe reasons they give are often tenuous for changing some aspects of african culture in order for it to cope with christian morality this finds a clear expression in the late albert schweitzers attitude towards the natives his work with them was based on the premise that they do not think profoundly and thus must be told what to do what to think without knowing the reason why in fact he went so far as to say that where the question of christian love is concerned he and the natives were brothers with the restrained observation that he was their big brother but the africans as far as i know are looking for friends and not particularly big brothers in breaking the bound of foreign rule they have become rather sensitive of domination of any kind even if branded with the name of christian philanthropy ive heard some of these natives say that anything done for them should be done out of love and not pity or pride it goes without saying that the question of honor if neglected in dealing with people soon makes itself felt in a crisis and ultimately negates every good intention and service a man would normally prefer to be poor rather than sacrifice honor and freedom for riches i remember a missionary who said to the africans in denouncing polygamy this is unchristian you see we missionaries practice monogamy because it is the christian way of marriage he left unsaid many other things which could have made his denunciation produce some positive effect rather than protest the africans were quick in recognizing that monogamy is practiced in the west by law and economic necessityfor there are many nonchristians in the west who marry one wife furthermore the bible does not incidentally condemn polygamy as evil he could have said for example that jesus christ advocated love as primary above all other considerations as one man cannot divide his love in the same way he cannot satisfactorily serve two masters it would be a travesty of the word to marry many wives pretending that he could possibly love them equally and well this is only a suggestion but the fact remains that he was preaching pure western civilization and not christian ethics the distance between western civilization and christianity today is not clearly defined i think this accounts for most of the difficulties in getting it across to nonwestern people another reason why the missionary finds it difficult to get his message across is that he goes into africa to occupy a managerial position train people and walk out of the job here my own view on mission work has been sharply opposed especially by africans most africans feel that missionaries should not go into africa to stay but to train them to be entirely independent and leave because the missionary has to be strict and firm in dealing with people if he is to accomplish anything he is regarded more or less like his political counterpart who must be obeyed who must rule and discipline people in order to get things done this places him in a predicament for he must use some measure of power as any leader must to fulfill his mission and those who are ruled do not usually take kindly to leaders who are strict the result is people who would rather leave the church and the mission if they disagree with the policy of a particular missionary leader like those who would leave their country when they dont like the president people who would say we need you only for your money and service but when we can take care of ourselves you should be gone in my own seventeen years of experience with the missionaries i have known them principally as leaders and because i have never lived as they expect me to i had to sustain punishments and disciplines of many kinds most of those i know who have gone through such years could not forgive them more than of those trained in the lutheran missions in liberia for instance have left the mission and the church to work for the government or some other institution of course we have to admit because they are human some missionaries have not used their powev with discretion in fact many of them never intended for the africans to be leadersa lot of improvement is now made in this direction with the rise of nationalism in africa and so we still look to the missionaries as masters some of these masters have long lived with the illusion that the africans must have a limited education in order to keep them subservient these missionaries do not want africans to think for themselves or meet them face to face as equals they build palaces among huts and forbid natives from entering into them new arrivals who begin to show an unrestrained delight in the natives are advised to be cautious in their dealings with them ive seen some missionaries who admit that they really dont like negroes their reason for being in africa wouldnt be anything other than to express the desire which is becoming a major problem for all of us nowadays to be somewhere else to go away from something and not for something when one talks about equality they think you want their money or houses or cars i would even be right to want these things because such would declare to the world that all the money put into mission work is mainly to help the poor helpless africans without saying that over half of it is for the missionaries convenience they of course would say this is necessary to keep them in africa but it is still true that they are using most of the money for themselves money collected in the name of the africans when i came to america nearly every american lutheran i met thought that he was paying for the very air i breathed the missionary in liberia would say that he cant feed us with spoons forever that is true but then why cant he be true to himself by saying that most of the money from his home is really for him and not us however i dont want their cars or housesfor i believe whatever one gets freely no matter how he got it is a stolen good until he pays the full price with his own effort or money so long as the moneyor some of itstill comes from their home the masters believe that they are in africa to be in control of everything and if they make an african a leader he is only their puppet even some of the few leaders they trained have no more than a grade school education and so must depend on them for any decision thousands of africans are therefore saying that this is pure imperialism imperialism however is too powerful a word because the missionaries unlike their political counterpart have not been working simply for profit this to me is the real reason for the lack of progress in mission work although missionaries are quick to attribute it to the fact that africans are animists for success in mission work those engaged in it must reckon with this fact missionaries should not go merely to direct manipulate and rule people but to live and work with them in love and equality here the peace corp program impresses me most the peace corps worker does not go out merely as a leader but as one who is willing to work with people as equals work where he is needed most if one does not work on this basis if one does not work in love and equality he is laboring for his own gloryin theological terms laboring under a curse i look for the missionary who would go out to work and live with people as equals in spite of the many differences in education social standards and economy this i believe will promote universal christian brotherhood or at least begin to promote it for this reason christian mission work should never end the christian missionaries in africa would represent christians in america and bear witness to the fact that christians all over the world are working together as brothers this would even promote international understanding and peace on earth this is what most africans dont want because they have always known missionaries as masters and the quicker the masters leave the better but it would be using them as a means to an end which is very unfairfor people are ends in themselves another important factor we must consider is that missionaries if they want to succeed in their mission must be themselves they are not going into africa to be africans or make people americans they can be united with africans in christ and not in culture it is becoming fashionable these days in the lutheran mission in liberia for example i mention lutherans often because i know them best other denominations could be mentioned in this category to take an african name wear african clothes and live like africans in some ways they have the right to do this out of curiosity but they have to make it clear that they cannot be africans and this does not mean that they despise africans the africans themselves must understand this when missionaries begin to show curiosity in their cultures the africans begin acting towards them as africans when the africans go to a point of no more advance they feel betrayed the missionary is going for a special mission like teaching or preaching or medicating and if he can fulfill this as best possible expressing love and respect for the people hes dealing with he has redeemed his pledge you dont have to be an american before you learn to love americans and vice versa missionaries must also report about the progress africans are making and not merely talk about their problems in order to raise funds africans are right when they become sensitive to the fact that their poverty ignorance and disease are reported more frequently than the tremendous progress they are making it would be unfair to tell the story of america in terms of what is happening today in alabama because it is always unfair to tell about the problems of people mentioning little or nothing at all about their progress the fact that we all have problems should make us more sympathetic make us love and appreciate one another more i realize that much of what ive said might not coincide with the popular imagination this essay is not a testimony of hate or bitterness i am deeply concerned about mission work and it pains me to see those receiving or giving these services taking unnecessary risks that are responsible for holding back its progress i have not raised all the questions or given all the answers my intent is that everyone concerned will begin thinking seriously in order that some of the dangers might be removed as much as that is possible the human element remains no matter what we do although certain failures have reduced goodness in man quite remarkably i still have confidence in mans capacity for clear thinking and righteous action love is the only hope for the removal of the dangers it was st paul who said that no matter what you do without love there is no gain in love we have to perform the greatest sacrifices for one another it is then and only then that we can hope and indeed expect to make progress in mission work and other undertakings designed to promote universal peace and brotherhood passage to an underground by ralph j gleason music has been v it the secret passage of jj many caucasian americans part way into the hidden underground world of the american negro if one possesses any amount of love for and is really involved in jazz music one inevitably confronts color true there are ways somewhat to avoid it one can be stareyed with show business or trapped by what lou gottlieb has called the music of obsequience but take even that past a certain point much less the involvement with the more outspoken contemporary jazzmen and the stark realities of american negro life not all but some hit you in the face go in far enough and its rougher the law is that the intensity varies in direct ratio to the depth of penetration in far enough and the soul truth is expressed generally as pure race and mother can cease to be familial term since the long hot summer exploded last august it has been impossible not to think of these things to have seen both the mime troupes ministrel show and leroi jones dutchman and the toilet on the same weekend was almost too much on one level the function of art whether it be jazz or poetry music drama or literature is always to help us to see and i can think of no better example of this truth than the blindness of the reaction to jones to the baldwin essays and to the minstrel show the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose baldwin wrote in the prophetic the fire next time leroi jones collection of angry animalistic teenagers in the toilet brings this to life the shocking thing is not the brutality but that a play which is so much a slice of reality should shock that set the boys room of a high school sordidly realistic wrecked by minority hatreds angry outbreak is the toilet of some high school we have all driven by its as simple as that to avoid looking at this lesson and learning from it because of false modesty about language is hypocrisy laid upon hypocrisy what word is used in that play that one has not heard before and survived curiously the realism is flawed the graffiti which exists on the walls of every unattended mens room in the country is strangely absent from the toilet though the actors use the words on stage no this play is real its mission high school in a sense just as dutchman is the jazz workshop andor north beach nothing in these plays is new but there are plenty of viewers to whom it is new itself no slight commentary the tragedy is in the attitude of the critics and censors who like chief parker in los angeles end up supporting the system which produced this frightening reality parkers remark were on top theyre on the bottom during the rioting will haunt him the rest of his life the minstrel show is another thing altogether it is neither shocking nor particularly instructive except that its another in the opportunities for black and white to laugh at each other together which is good it set out to be revolutionary theater and ended up great entertainment a lot of fun and more proof ronnie davis is a brilliant director it has however no point of view and really says nothing which marks it from all the other mime troupe productions baldwin and jones are telling us the building is going to blow up it is foolish if not tragic to allow shock at the form of that announcement to blind us to the reality of the danger all caucasians should see leroi jones plays they tell it like it is just as the jazzmen have for decades we need to listen and to understand their message nothing is more imperative reprinted from the san francisco chronicle needed a negro film movement by walter moore he cinema first of all rip g is an art it is a great art capable of utilizing mrs rvr its unrivaled technical superiority to convey ideas it is a unique art capable of illuminating the imagination of the spectator as well as making a profound imprint upon the concepts of the human conscious the great works of literature are transformed from lifeless white paper and black ink to be projected upon the motion screen as a living visual expression theatrical dramas are liberated from the narrow confines of the stage and indeed the world becomes a stage thus it can be said without a doubt that the cinema is of profound significance and is the greatest medium of expression in our modern technological society knowing these vast and vital benefits of the cinema it is disturbing to say the least that the negrohas made absolutely no creative contribution to this art it is a fact that while the peoples of asia and latin america have for years now been creating films there has not been one film made by negroes whether in africa the united states or the caribbean that is a film conceived written produced directed photographed and edited by negroes nigerian writer j koyinde vaughn adds further food for thought when he writes what attempts are being made to develop african cinema productions that will counteract decades of distortion future screen presentations of african life with the infinite possibilities of dramatizing both the past and african aspirations can only be successfully achieved by africans conscious of the great contribution we must make to the art of the cinema recently a short article published in negro digest asked why arent negroes in the business of making movies about themselves why no negro movies why sammy davis jr answers this question simply and eloquently when he says that there are twenty negro groups who could put a whole studio togetherbut they want to build a chicken shack instead of building a recreation center they build a church and gin mill but what would the reaction of audiences be to a negro cinema would it suffer the same fate as so many other negro endeavors this would depend upon the quality content and the techniques of these films but a reasonable and logical conjecture would be that these films if wisely constructed would probably be highly successful both artistically and commercially for the whole world has learned to appreciate the genius of the negro as an artist of rhythmic and plastic expressions the whole world has learned to appreciate the genius of jazz and since the cinema is a combination of plastic and rhythmic images and because of the worlds acceptance and recognition of the negros genius in these respective fields of cultural expressions it is easy to believe that negro films could quickly capture world popularity and could even conceivably dwarf declining hollywood and the rest of the world film centers the negro film however can only be this successful if it is artistically and technically prepared to compete with other films a negro film movement would closely parallel the independent film movement in america and the world today for the era of the big hollywood studios is over in this unique sense hollywood is dead this is the new era of the independent film maker unshackled from the dominance of the large complexes the independent producers are turning out the great pictures today the best example of these independent film makers are the mirisch brothers a few months ago the mirisch company celebrated its fifth anniversary in that time according to press releases the company produced eighteen pictures ie the magnificent seven irma la douce grossed one hundred million dollars and won sixteen academy awards behind every success story lies a reasona need discovered and fulfilled there can be no doubt that there is a great need for films about negroes if for nothing more than that we exist in significant quantity in the mainstream of world society this is a need discovered there are within the context of american society over twenty million negroes who would like to see films portraying us as significant human beings projecting our personality to the world we need a negro cinema which is capable of illustrating profoundly what we were what we are and what we are capable of becoming a negro cinema which would produce films which the white man would not and could not create honestly all we need do now is fulfill this need thus far i have stated the great need for a negro film movement but i havent offered any suggestions of how best to create one for besides being an art the cinema requires certain unique and specialized skills peculiar to the cinema again unlike an authors pen and paper or an artists oils and canvas the cost of producing a film is not negligible large sums of money must be invested even before the cameras began to turn this matter of economics accounts largely for the lack of a negro cinema the negro digest january main reason however is a lack of interest and our chronic dependence upon the white man to overcome this glaring obstacle interest in such a project must be motivated there should be formed a group of people with a deep interest in the cinema and a strong desire in spite of the many obstacles to see their dreams one day realized this group could seek out interesting ideas and topics to film discover talented negro thespians writers directors cinematographers and technicians it should then seek to secure financial backing in an attempt to turn out reputable films once the group establishes itself as being truly cinematic it could thus expand itself gradually to the point where it could turn out several feature length films annually if the group is recognized as turning out good quality films it will find itself in an easy position to secure financial backing to produce even more and better films thus this group could begin modestly and gradually rise to the position of turning out full length features of high merits and refined taste the rate of growth of this company would depend upon one thingthe quality of the films this is determined by the abilities of the artists and technicians skills and talent will attract the necessary financial backing it must also be understood that to produce a feature length film it is not absolutely necessary to have the multitude of technicians that are used on a hollywood sound stage this is only being eccentricit is a luxury rather than a necessity ingmar bergman uses only or technicians in creating his outstanding films therefore the first step is to lay a foundation by discovering negroes who have an aptitude for the cinema and a burning desire to create films and a great new art movement would then be borne the negro people who have so much to say to the world who have a great wealth of folklore and history will have at last realized and put to use the greatest medium of expression to tell a great storythe story of the negro we should act now a negro cinema is desperately needed for the millions of black peoples in america africa and latin america who would like to see realistic portrayals of themselves upon the motion picture screens of the world portraits ofa poevuu raconteur y pudlewrandall have not had many opportunities to talk to r great men and most of those occasions came to nothing either i would meet them as i was in a line of wellwishers and would be elbowed out of the way by the next person in line or after they had dropped a few perfunctory commonplaces upon me they would be swept to tea or cocktails by important people with m b tolson however it was different one night poetsculptor oliver lagrone telephoned me that tolson was in town and invited me to come and meet him i found him to be as langston hughes has described him a man who can talk to students cottonpickers and cowpunchers a great talkera very warm and human person with his bald head fringed by gray tufts over his ears and his seamed smiling face he looked like an oldfashioned preacher when he settled back in his chair took a cigar in his right hand and a glass in his left and remarked that tonight he would forget about jim crow and concentrate on old crow we knew that we were in for a night of good talk inasmuch as many critics have hailed him as a great poet but none has mentioned his supremacy as a talker i amgoing to enlarge on this aspect of his talent his style is expansive this may come from his many years at wiley and langston as a college professor with a captive audience or it may spring from his natural tendency to expatiate both his prizewinning dark symphony and his libretto for the republic of liberia are long poems and his page harlem gallery is only part one of a projected poem in four parts he is not a poet given to short swallow flights of song he never cuts through the bam when it is possible to stroll around it but during his walk around the barn he dispenses treasures of observation learning and humor culled from vast experience and reading an example of his indirect method as well as his socratic method of teaching by questioning is his anecdote about a white northern club woman who was distressed because a southern member of her club asserted that negroes steal chickens instead of abruptly denying this tolson asked did you ever see movies of a southern mansion with a huge dining hall and chandeliers and a linencovered table where old colonel sat to dinner with his family yes she answered and did you see a black butler in a white coat bringing in a platter of fried chicken balanced high in the air with one hand yes well black sam served the chicken and who cooked the chicken his wife i guess yes black mandy sweated over the stove to cook the chicken and who fed and watered and took care of the chicken his daughter i suppose yes little cindy raised that chicken and who grew the com and crops that fattened the chicken so the colonel could eat it the butlers son yes black junior toiling in the fields raised the corn to fatten that chicken but who ate the chicken by this time the clubwoman had begun to see the point and was smiling the colonel of course yes the colonel ate that chicken but somewhere on that plantation was a black patrick henry who said give me liberty or give me chicken now did the colonel give him his liberty no the woman answered with a smile then as tolson described with mockfreudian symbols how the slave captured the hen by tickling its rump with a long pole the woman shook with laughter and he says she was never again disturbed by the southern womans allegations that negroes stole chickens tolson could have answered her simply by saying that this was compensation for economic and social exploitation but instead of using the abstract jargon of the sociologist he dramatized the situation with the invention and humor of the poet another characteristic of his talk is his ability to adjust it to his audience i heard him on two occasions once when he was with a group of young poets and again when he was in a group of nonwriters on the first occasion he acted as a catalyst advising the poets to study and revise demonstrating for those who thought knowledge of technique would destroy their spontaneity that it would make their work stronger showing those who thought that they could not improve their first inspirations that they could make them better telling those pressed for time to write that he worked after midnight in the company of cats and owls admonishing them that poetry was performance and not propaganda he told many literary anecdotes he said the critic v f calverton praised him as having the potential of becoming the greatest negro poet tolson was nonplused and said you flatter me calverton replied why in hell should i flatter you tolson said that at breadloaf writers conference saul bellow called him subversive because the young poets would bring beer and hamburgers to his cottage at night and would sit on the floor listening to his anecdotes until the small hours and would oversleep and miss their sessions the next day tolson related that after com pleting libretto for the republic of liberia he asked allen tate to write a preface for it and tate replied that he wasnt interested in the propaganda of negro poets tolson spent a year studying modern poetic techniques and rewriting the poem so that it said the same things in a different way and then sent it to tate tate wrote a preface in which he said for the first time it seems to me a negro poet has assimilated the full poetic language of his time if the first version of the poem still exists it would be interesting to see it in a variorum edition with the rewritten version and to compare them one of the poets who was present that night wrote ill never forget mr tolsons marvelous mind and simple humility and absolute integrity tolson is modest about his achievements he admits that he began as a mediocre poet but developed his art by learning and experimenting he says that dark symphony is a good poem but not a great one at a lecture he read his poem my soul and i and after the applause had died down startled the audience by saying that was a bad poem you shouldnt have applauded he proceeded to analyze the poem phrase by phrase and line by line explaining where and how it was bad and how he had improved it by revision with the second nonwriting group tolsons talk was entirely different he did not refer to poetry at all except to remark that perhaps the reason he was unknown among his own people was that when white people want to hide something from negroes they put it in a book or a magazine since his host was a graduate of wiley college where tolson had taught and had coached the debating team he reminisced upon his experiences there he told of taking the team to the university of southern california and scouting the speech department which was as large as all of wiley college when he got back the team asked about their opponents and wanted to visit the campus he told them theyre not so much well visit them after we win the debate just to show them were good sports little wiley college won the debate tolson has great gusto as a talker the night met him lagrone and i left early as he was convalescing from a major operation but we found out later that he had learned that james farmer one of his students was in detroit and telephoning until he located him he had gone out and spent the night in talk and had not returned to his sisters home until five oclock the next morning at his home in langston oklahoma he formed a zulu club like the zulu club wits in harlem gallery where men meet to discuss and exchange ideas chapters have been formed in various cities across the country they are composed of men of all occupations from professional men to laborersanyone who is interested in reading thinking and exchanging ideas in his conversation he hints of some day writing his autobiography the life and times of m b tolson retired now from his position at langston university he occupies a newly created chair in humanities at tuskegee institute with only one class to teach it will be profitable if he can use his newfound leisure not only to complete harlem gallery but also to write his memoirs as they should be invaluable for the humor the recollections of literary figures and the record of the poetic development of this gifted poet and raconteur karens spring by eloise greenfield maren splashed the suds listlessly over the m dishes humming h cheerfully for the ss benefit of larry who was reading in the living room she wondered that she had been able to fool him these past weeks he always recognized the symptoms of her doldrums and it was part of their closeness that he waited until she was ready to tell him the reasons and she always did but this time she couldnt she couldnt say to him i dont want our baby our baby that weve talked about and planned for these last eight monthsand even before she looked out at the perky april greens and pinks and yellows but felt only weariness she used her arm to push a black curl back from her forehead just last month she had felt at one with spring had felt the joyousness they shared of life within preparing to bloom karen and phyllis her friend who lived in the apartment across the hall had spent the winter happily comparing prenatal progress and exchanging books on baby care and looking forward to this special spring i counted twelve blades of grass and seven leaves on the way to the store phyllis had come by to tell her one day in early march spring karen had sighed and they had grinned proudly as if personally responsible for the birth of the new season but now she hated spring and she hated blond blueeyed phyllis whose baby would be born into a world of open doors and welcoming arms while restrictions and insinuations conflict and frustration would be waiting for her brown one karen loved the negro colors the golds the blacks the subtle shadings of tan the photograph or painting of a face evoked in her a strong sense of identification an almost physical leaning toward the likeness of her people she loved the full expressive lips which reflected in the men and women the depth of their feelings and in the children the sweet petulance found in all children but how could she bring something she loved into a world of so little love each morning for the past three weeks karen had awakened with a guilty feeling and the thought today ill visit phyllis but each hour came and went with the excuse that it was too early or too late she was too busy or tired or outofsorts the prospect of listening once more to the confident plans phyllis had made for the babys future was more than she could bear and now with phyllis almost a week overdue she still hadnt seen her it was hard for her to face this new hostility in herself she didnt want to hurt phyllis and she did want to hurt phyllis she felt that she could stand by and watch with grim glee as phyllis plans fell through one by one and it was with horror that she realized the strength of this emotion shed been angry before of course but it had always been directed at them the conglomerate them who greeted her coldly in the department stores who on television questioned her right to live fully who used her for political power was it the deeply protective feeling she had for the child inside her she wondered that had intensified and personalized this anger so that now when she most needed to be warm and loving she had become almost inhuman she thought back to her own mother love is all thats needed karen she had said love and forgiveness karen picked up the terry cloth towel and began to dry the dishes i hope its a girl she thought its the men who have it the hardest karen larry called from the living room the firmness of his voice sent a nervous ripple through her stomach and the baby kicked once as if in protest ill be through in a minute she answered she dried the last plate and slowly closed the door of the paneled cabinet okay now larry said taking her hand as she sat down beside him what is it what is what karen asked brightly youve been upset for weeks i havent bothered you before because i knew youd tell me but you havent larry theres nothing wrong with me she insisted and saw the hurt start around his mouth rise to his eyes and change suddenly to anger you dont eat he said in a hard voice you constantly hum those same three notes you havent been to see phyllis all right karen interrupted ill visit phyllis if itll make you happy she slammed out of the apartment to escape his hurt and the questions across the hall she paused at phyllis door before knocking wondering how she should explain her prolonged absence hi karen come on in phyllis said dully and karen could see that she had been crying karen looked toward the bedroom as she took the chair by the window is bob home she asked not yet phyllis answered hes working late tonight she lowered herself carefully onto the sofa howve you been karen asked she realized with a shock that during the time she had been avoiding phyllis phyllis hadnt visited her either just fine except ive been in an awful mood i didnt want to inflict on you she gasped suddenly and gripped the arm of the sofa youre in labor karen said rushing to her no no im not phyllis said bursting into tears but you are phyllis whats the matter with you have you phoned bob no i cant i dont want the baby phyllis said hysterically releasing her grip on the sofa karen stared at her you dont dont you see karen its cruel to bring a baby into a world like this to grow up in a world of wars and murders and hate and maybe itll be better for our children karen said realizing the inadequacy of her words but desperate to convince phyllis before the baby arrived that she really did want him it was suddenly very important to her that his birth be an experience of joy and wonder and not of resignation how can it be phyllis asked calmer now but with hopelessness whos going to make it better we will karen said as much to herself as to phyllis well make it a better world well write letters see our congressmen well join other people who are doing things she got phyllis bag from the bedroom and set it down near the door you and i have wasted nine whole months dreaming and drooling karen continued preparing a room a layette a crib but not a wrorld in which our children can live love is not enough we have to work too now call bob and tell him to meet you at the hospital ill get larry to take you karen phyllis called as karen started back to her own apartment thanks thank you karen said silently thank you phyllis judahs a twoway street running out by jack burris lay looked up from the newspaper when the figure passed recognized it as a woman from his neighborhood and started to smile but then he saw the ice in her eyes remembered he was a cityboy now and reraised the newspaper thats the trouble with them niggers he thought addressing to himself the words he had so often heard spoken about himself and others they dont stick together aint got no gumption less you wave a relief check at em who me boss he answered his own charges amused by the game now that he no longer had to play it heck boss not me all wants to do is sit here in the back of the bus and ride out to judah street so i can get me a job thats all want honest boss then ill go home and eat my watermelon and dance in the mud and sing my happy songs for you and then maybe tonight ill poke a pickaninny up the old lady if she aint too tired from scrubbin yore floors an stealin yore food honest boss thats all i want except that wasnt all he wanted and they would spot the lie quickly enough and bring him to account or maybe not maybe this time they wouldnt or maybe they wouldnt even care that card was due to come up too claire mae had promised the least he could do for her was sit there in the back of the bus and ride it out even to the last stop if he had to go that far only he wasnt really on the back of the bus of course he was sitting in the front seat of a streetcar where he always sat or at least as often as he reasonably could claire mae had teased him about it had asked him if he thought he was proving something to somebody and he had answered that the only thing it proved was they were living in san francisco now and he supposed any blackass fool could tell that quickly enough just by looking out the window he still sat at the front of buses though knowing that there would be time enough later for indifference looking through the hairoil smeared window he carefully checked the address given in the newspaper against those painted on the windows of the stores they were passing two more blocks he decided and lifted his arm preparing to pull the cord that would signal his desire to stop he hesitated though not knowing exactly where the streetcars next stop was and not wanting in his eagerness to be forced to walk those last two blocks just because hed signalled too early while he waited undecided he felt the cord sliding through his slippery fingers and heard the bell tinkle in front of him surprised and even mildly disappointed he stood up immediately and walked toward the doors at the back even though he had to fight against several people who were forcing their way to the front theres time enough for me to do that later too he thought pausing to let an old woman step before him today im going to obey all them dumb ofays rules stepping down he quickly spotted the building in the next block that was his destination claire mae had described it well that morning just as she had carefully described the whole neighborhood for him she had done so partially to avoid his getting lost again as he had done when he first went downtown to look for work but he knew her detailed description had also come from her nervousness her unspoken desperation hed spotted that quickly right at the start when shed looked up from ironing his shirt and said in all seriousness youll recognize judah easily enough its a twoway street running out to the ocean hed wanted to stop her then to ask her mockingly how many ways the street ran when it came back from the ocean but she was too painfully intent to interrupt still too aware of the fact that it had been at her suggestion that they had moved to san francisco back to the city of her childhood anyway it was because san francisco was her city that he had been willing to listen too grateful for any information she might offer however humorously expressed to risk losing it and the security it might later give him one thing you can say about me i never tease the hand thats feeding me no sir not me boss thinking about hands he took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his own hands while he was walking look ma look how good you taught me he thought remembering now without any real resentment how his mother had told him to always wipe his hand on the inside of his pocket before shaking hands with a white man she hadnt said it in words but she made him understand that even a simple thing like sweat which on another white man would be ignored on him would be magnified once after shed died and before claire mae had found him hed worn pocketless pants carefully cutting the right front pocket out of each new pair that he bought willingly sacrificing the convenience for the sake of the joke but that was before claire mae she wouldnt see anything funny in it at least not as long as she was working in a white mans house every day to pay for those pants so now he left the pockets in and carefully wiped his hands on a handkerchief lo how the mighty has fallen the door was locked when he tried it he gave it a second try to make sure then checked his watch the ad had said ten oclock so he had almost twenty minutes to wait he considered going to search for a coffee shop but then balanced that against the impression he might give if he were standing there when the owner arrived yes suh boss ahs always early yes suh and no cavities either he decided instead to have a cigarette even though there were only five left in the pack and they had to last the day he was still standing there in the doorway enjoying the smoke and the warmth of the early sun when he saw the other man approaching he recognized the man as a neighbor of sorts in that he lived somewhere in the same overfilled apartment building clay had seen him sometimes when he was climbing the stairs or emptying the garbage and the man usually dressed up as though for saturday night would pass silently by their eyes always failing to make contact it wasnt that the man was unfriendly he knew but simply that in that house the only privacy to be had was in refusing to recognize people maybe you had to listen to your neighbors television and kids and fights and screwings but you didnt have to recognize those neighbors when you saw them not even in broad daylight on the stairs the man had stopped looked first at the address on the door then at clay and finally nodded hi man hi clay answered smiling and offered his hand im clay carter live on the third floor back apartment the man nodded again and gave him a smile in return clay noticed the mishapen goldcapped teeth thought i recognized you im william potter only call me billy like in goat im staying with my sister and her old man up on the top floor he smiled again this time without the show of teeth only i wont be tomorrow less something turns up clay nodded this time then watched as the man lit a cigarette hed already noticed the mans frayed shirt dirty at the neck and the lack of a crease in the trousers of his black suit been looking long four months billy said before that i had unemployment so i took it easy man i didnt know when i was well off i had this job deliverin diapers see only i didnt think it was good enough not for a college man so i quit hell i had to learn now man id pick up them dirty diapers with my teeth theyd let me this is only my second month clay said but i know what you mean i got a wife working so i guess it aint as bad but were just gettin started out here so far it aint been much of a start man dont you worry none aint you heard about the presedents new bill he gets that passed man were gonna have rights up the ass wont even have to work just go pick us some money off that moneytree marked niggers only sure only watch out for the man hes behind that tree somewhere and hes got him a shaft marked niggers only too dont you believe that man why i heard govnor wallace just last night said them dirty coonsll be pickin the money and the white folksll have to pick the cotton aint that a shame man i cried all night clay laughed enjoying his new friends gestures as much as the words wonder who theyll burn their crosses for then why them dirty commies of course theyre the ones startin all this fuss anyway them cottonpickin niggers wasnt causin no trouble until them yankee commies started in i thought the niggers and the commies were one and the same no billy said theyre different them commies are sort of bleachedout niggers see didnt you hear about dr dejone hes the head of the science department down there at good old georgia u or someplace like that and he wrote this book provin that all commies are just washedout niggers something about the curse of god and ham and small heads i didnt read all of it but it was something like that clay flicked the butt of his cigarette out over a parked car and into the street he checked his watch saw that they still had almost five minutes to wait and leaned back against the wall of the building billy was trying to look through the window cupping his hands around his eyes to shut out the outside light i think theres somebody in there must of come in the back door clay said you think we have much of a chance yeah man the best aint we niggers man and aint this old niggerlovin san francisco hell soon as that old white boss looks at us hes gonna say coons youre both hired clay laughed trying to hide his nervousness i guess we can always threaten to picket them picket hell im gonna tell them if i dont get this job ill have old buddy marty come in and pray for them hey watch out man here comes that little old white chick to let us in um um wouldnt my brother like a piece of that the secretary who had let them into the office also explained to them that mr robertson would be a little late and then helped them fill out the application forms then when these were completed she showed them two chairs where they could wait at first clay had found her attractive but the more she talked in her phony dead voice the more he lost interest he was grateful to her for her kindness but he wondered how soon he would hate her if he had to work in the same office dont worry about that man you aint got the job yet although she had given them some magazines to look at while they waited clay couldnt get interested in them instead he watched the men moving back and forth in the back part of the office he noticed that there were no negroes but he couldnt decide if that were a blessing or a curse maybe they would hire him just to prove their tolerance but on the other hand maybe they were planning to wait until they absolutely had to before they gave in three other men all of them white had come in since he had been sitting and the secretary was helping them through the problems of the application forms clay watched them closely trying to balance his own qualifications against theirs they were obviously in less dire needotherwise they couldnt have afforded such clothingbut he refused to think about that for long having given up the idea of poeticjustice along with his diapers he overheard them listing some of their qualifications but not enough to influence him one way or the other he finally gave up the game concluding only that two of them might give him some serious competition the third man who was still a pimplescarred youth he threw into the reject file in his mind where he had much earlier placed billy potter mr carter clay tried to locate the source of the voice turning his head slightly he saw a large middleaged man in a grey doublebreasted business suit he was holding an application form and clay recognized it as his own yes sir clay answered quickly standing up and moving toward the man im mr robertson the man said offering his hand oh sorry mama but this cat aint goin to give me no time for wipin okay ofay have some sweet sweat how do you do sir would you come this way please clay followed him the office door had the name mr abraham robertson printed on it in gold lettering abraham huh like from the bible well abraham i aint your isaac so dont go gettin no ideas i done played that game abe all my life honest abe l just want a job honest abe clay sat down on the edge of the politelyoffered chair refused the cigarette that he needed so badly his mouth watered at its sight and smiled thanking god that there werent any gold caps on his teeth mr robertson pretended a fascination with the application form letting him cool his heels clay supposed hey you dumb ass im over here not on that piece of paper the message must have been received for mr robertson looked up startled i see you have an ma yes sir you realize of course that the job which is open doesnt require that kind of ability its only an accounting position yes sir i know that but i thought that perhaps it would be a good place for me to start the ofay smiled youre not too humble to start at the bottom dont give me that jazz man you want me to clean your toilets for openers show me the brush no sir to be quite frank i need a job ive only recently moved to san francisco from the south and im finding it a little difficult to get started is that begging mama okay so now im a beggar next week start peddlin the dope yes i see that on your application form i dont recognize your college mr carter its a negro college in alabama sir oh clay felt the irritation rising in him like an erection hard against his gut oh is that all its going to be white man just oh one little word not even of sympathy but merely indifference and then the door you think wanted to go to that friggin little school you think i couldnt have made it at harvard if vd had the chance his fingernails cutting into his palms brought him back in time to realize he had missed a question i beg your pardon sir i asked if what youve listed here is your total work experience yes sir it is you see i only finished college last year and then we moved out here oh yes i see four words this time but they amounted to the same clay couldnt even feel the irritation now it had dissolved blending with a thousand past irritations leaving him with only a sour taste in his mouth the interview was over he knew and he was out as usual now all that was left was the long ride to the end of the line that long ride he had to take for claire mae not for himself because he already knew yes sir he said quickly answering another useless question yes sir mr robertson yes sir you are absolutely right capn only come on daddy dont drag it out kill me quick abe aint no sense messin around aint gonna be no savin message from god this time when he phoned claire mae from the bar later she took the news pretty hard she didnt agree with him as she usually didbut you dont know yet clay not reallynor did she bother asking him what he was doing in a bar when he could be looking for work in other places she just said all right as though it was a kind of vocal shrug and then said shed see him that night when she finally came home though she was feeling better evidently her work that afternoon had smoothed away the edge of her disappointment just as the liquor had smoothed away his because she listened patiently to the details of his explanation then embraced him and said it doesnt matter hon somethingll turn up tomorrow maybe right here in fillmore cant every boss in this city be a white twofaced bastard she fixed him a steak for dinner singing all the time she was cooking to show him she still had faith and while they ate they talked confidently of the future of the house they would someday buy and the children they would raise and the trips they would take and if anybody can make it all happen guess claire mae can he thought smiling inwardly at the strength of her determination when they were watching television the newscaster mentioned that the presidents civil_rights bill was having trouble in the house but that it still seemed a sure thing to pass he felt claire mae touch his arm while the man was talking but whether it was to give him confidence or to seek some from him he couldnt determine they sat there huddled together as though for protection while the little white men danced in blackandwhite before them laughing together when the occasional lone negro passed by in the background they can hire me for show too if they want if aint black enough for them ill even put on a little mantan claire mae as though sensing his thoughts leaned against him he unbuttoned her blouse and rested his hand beneath it when she didnt pull away he started working on the bra as well clay there was no warning note in her voice only a kind of questioning yeah i thought you wanted to watch this show screw that show lets go to bed she sat upright then forcing his hand away but she was smiling i aint done the dishes yet screw them too she laughed man you do all that screwing you aint going to be much use to me you try me he said reaching again for her she caught his hand and kissed it i got to get that kitchen cleared up first them cockroachesll carry the whole house off if i dont and i need me a bath too you hintin at something me course not makes sense though that if you took care of the kitchen while i was taking me a bath wed both get to that bed faster dont it he lunged for her laughing but she beat him again jumping up and heading for the bathroom you aint out of that tub time i get ready im climbin in with you he yelled after her she paused long enough to give him a smile then disappeared behind the bathroom door clay turned the television off finding some consolation in shutting up some stupid ofay right in the middle of a sentence the kitchen really wasnt too bad there were only a few dishes on the table to clear away he knew there wouldnt be enough hot water to wash them since claire mae was running it for a bath and so he only wiped at them the best he could he heard her singing in the tub and he tried to hum the tune along with her as he worked but he heard himself go offkey and quit heres one nigger that cant carry a tune boss cant do much of anything else either seems like he was looking out the kitchen window and down onto the halflit street while he rinsed and stacked the dishes he saw the figure of a man get off the bus at the corner he thought it was billy porter but it wasnt until the man started to cross the street that he was sure hed forgotten about his neighbor just as hed forgotten the interview during the long drinking afternoon but now that he saw him again he wanted to talk with him if for no other reason than to compare notes on the mornings embarrassment he searched for some excuse saw the sack of garbage heaped to the level of spilling and grabbing it rushed out into the hall he was too quick he heard billy just starting to climb the stairs as he dropped the bag down the chute and so he had to wait emptyhanded so maybe hell think im waiting for him i dont give a damn i am hell want to see me too only natural hes probably just as disappointed as i am and he doesnt have a wife fixing herself up just for his pleasure clay heard the song then the tune climbing up the stairway like an echo of the footsteps and it bothered him he heard in it not sadness not disappointment but a quiet joy of contentment what if he got the job the question rattled inside his head knocking aside all the old defenses spawning other questions in its flight what if billy the rejected of clay had been the accepted what would claire mae find to say in consolation then how could an ofay be a bastard if clay clutched the end of the handrail and watched the figure of the man climbing like a black christ rising from a tomb to announcewhat what will he announce what new joyous disaster the tune danced in the still air to the rhythm the footsteps beat out in warning no oh my god not that too the black face was first to reach the level of the hallway looking like a dark moon against a pale horizon and as clay watched in fear the tiny internal smile spread broadly in recognition hi man hi clay answered forcing his voice to sound casual hey you sure sound happy enough hell why not i got me a job man so the drum warnings had been of doom and he hadnt prepared in time what did it matter though he had built the only defense he had the only kind he knew and if it wasnt enough yeah hey thats great man i didnt think that dumb ofay could even see us niggers there in that dark office him mr robertson hell man he couldnt that aint where got my job i got back on at the diaper factory clay laughed chasing the terrors away again by his sheer volume yeah hell i thought for a minute youd gotten the other job nah billie answered smiling he seemed puzzled by clays outburst hell i called them this afternoon pretended i was somebody new you know like i hadnt been there this morning they told me it was already filled they must have taken one of them dumb ofays that was standin there when we was there clay smiled finished with the topic now that he had found his fears to be groundless well im glad you got you a job anyway thanks it aint much but itll pay the rent they stood there quietly as though neither of them was sure how to break away clay looked past billy down the stairs looking intently at the door as though the outside world were waiting there like a puppy whimpering to be let in fog must be coming in he said i felt it a minute ago nah its clear out billy answered clear as a virgins conscience they shared a laugh and then clay shrugged must be me then i sure thought i felt it coming in billy didnt answer he stood quietly another moment still a few stairs from the top then started climbing again moving past clay well guess i better get on up that sister of mine may even feed me tonight she hears the news fore she starts thro win things okay man see you clay watched the back of his friend as he climbed the stairs on up to the next floor sharing with him for a moment a genuine pleasure for his new job tomorrow may be my turn he thought promising himself and claire mae or at least the next day its got to come sooner or later if we can only wait long enough the footsteps if they were an omen were fading fast now so they no longer seemed threatening they stopped a door opened and then closed quickly again clay smiled wiped his sweating hands down across his trousers and started back to his own apartment back to claire mae who he knew was still waiting in the dark and wide bed to give him comfort by don shepherd rofessor roberts squinted at the top of his dresser finding he put made a tie his glasses on and to j his y his pipe and stuflfed them in this pocket and walked down the hall toward the stairs at the first landing the professor wiped the steam from the window with his hand and peered out it was a dark windy morning and the rain was beating heavily against the window usually on mornings such as this he savored the warmth the glowing lights and the breakfast aromas that permeated the house but this morning the weather vaguely registered in the professors mind for he was preoccupied with matters concerning the hatcher theory the professor entered the dining room and was disappointed to find it empty sitting down he brushed aside the morning paper and sipped his orange juice it was strange he thought for years he and his colleagues had laughed whenever anyone mentioned professor hatcher he remembered that when he first started teaching zoology one of the standard jokes in his lecture on genetics concerned hatchers theory it seems the professor mused that ol hatcher has had the last laugh he picked up the paper glanced at the headlines and put it down again say he called isnt there anyone in the house breakfast will be ready in a minute dear his wife called from the kitchen where are the kids theyve already gone to school the professor looked at his pocketwatch how do you like that he said to himself my great hour of triumph and theres no one around to help me celebrate again he picked up the paper and glanced at the front page his wife entered from the kitchen carrying a plate of eggs and a pot of steaming coffee good morning dear she said the professor looked up and smiled the kids left earlier than usual didnt they yes its quite bad out this morning and they had a chance to ride to school im sorry i missed them i wanted to talk to them this morning well thats a new one said his wife generally you just growl at them in the morning oh come now have i really been that bad the professors wife poured him a cup of coffee youve been a real grouch lately do you realize how long youve been working on this project its been quite a while now its been thirteen months the project was going along quite smoothly until you got the invitation to speak before the world congress ive hardly seen you at all since then i know emily its been hard on you and im not thinking of myself jason youre going to ruin your health with this ridiculous pace youve set for yourself the nuclear destruction of the lost civilization has been a mystery for thousands of years surely the world can wait a few more years for the answer yes said the professor its just that i felt that some discovery would justify my being chosen over so many others to speak before the congress but you dont have to find anything new you were chosen for your past accomplishments well anyway said the professor it was worth the effort i have some astonishing news to announce the professors wife looked at him at amazement you mean youve discovered something the professor smiled yes he said we broke the code to their alphabet and finished the project about three oclock this morning most of the vestiges that we have so far are of little use to us but curiously enough that little plaque that we found in the southern part of the continent a couple of years ago has proved to be extremely valuable the one we found on our vacation said his wife excitedly tv right said the professor the paint on the plaque had contained leadpigment with the aid of chemicals we brought out the figures quite clearly last night we translated it and it read this entrance for white people only the professors wife drew a sharp breath the hatcher theory she said right again said the professor with this plaque and in view of previous findings we have conclusive proof of the theory presented by the late professor wilber hatcher a couple of thousand years ago probably around the twentieth century there was indeed a race of whiteskinned people on the earth professor roberts paused and continued this seems also to substantiate our theory that their cultural development did not keep pace with their scientific progress i would guess that our ancestors discriminated against these people simply because their skin was white pigmentation by dr carl a larson rouse life light must meet color in the sterile vastness of space where light meets light stars and planets roll empty and dead plants of our earthen soil and seas use pigments green and yellow and red to capture light and turn its energy to build sugars and compound foods for vegetable and animal life the minutest freeliving cell with a simple eyespot has pigment to receive light and elicit small voltages necessary for goaloriented motion without coloring matter or pigment life as we know it would be extremely poor or extinct then an intense and widespread interest in pigment is natural and selfexplaining an enlightened public thirsts for knowledge about the wonders and the hidden meaning of color in the course of human affairs facts from laboratories and the fields of observational research are grasped by the eager hands of men and women striving to bridge the gaps of fatal ignorance and group rancor well yes but a yes with a few shamefaced qualifications when it comes to human pigmentation interest grows worldwide indeed but the source of that interest is not always respectable or even presentable some people think they know a mans dreams his thoughts and his skills when they know his color we need not respect such delusive reasoning nevertheless whatever its source factual knowledge about the meaning of human diversity would help us see wherefrom we come and whereto we go we know much about blood pigments and gall pigments we understand a little about the part played by light absorption in the immense drama of life and so we could expect the widespread interest in skin pigmentation to have crystallized into some knowledge of gemlike clarity this is not the case we have a series of facts that is true but they admit of very limited conclusions when the origin and advantage of diversity in skin color are concerned the deviations from normal pigmentation have however long challenged the medical profession partial changes of hue especially in the face on the neck and arms meet little love today and in times past white spots in tan faces caused much alarm because they were frequently taken as signs of the dreaded and poorly understood lepra or leprosy now better called hansens disease to avoid derogatory associations the pigmented bearers of ancient civilizations indians and egyptians knew remedies against such depigmented spots thus atharva veda the sacred book of india from about b c prescribed certain black seeds against white spots this sounds like magic likeness in color would transfer a property from the remedium to the patient but hints of early and accurate experience of successful treatment are provided by folklore and late observations to the former type of evidence belongs the ageold use in india and egypt of a plant ammi majus for the cure of white spots the roots of this plant were chewn and the effect in the form of pigmentation came forth after the exposure of the skin to sunlight now the active substance of the plant are known and used in treatment of the annoying spots the effect is often slow and irregular it is not free from dangers and should never be undertaken without medical advise and supervision the second pointer to experience behind the idea of swallowing something to cure a skin condition might be found in the observation of nutritional disturbances with loss of pigment now and then an observant medicine man might have come upon a drug that either ameliorated a malnutrition or seemed to have an effect because it happened to be taken together with the adequate food to illustrate in africa nutritional diseases with the local names buaki mbuaki and diboba go with loss of color here as well as in the more widelyknown kwashiorkor an unbalanced proteindefective diet lies at the root of the disease when the deficiency in the diet is corrected normal pigmentation returns this also applies to the sometimes observed pigmentary changes in vitamin a deficiency uneven pigmentation and loss of pigment are mere signs of unbalanced diet in such disorders today protein starvation sometimes masked by a relative abundance of carbohydrates is a great killer of infants and children and stealer of strength in adults in many young countries protein starvation results from a lopsided agriculture an analogous situation obtained in the southern part of the united states where pellagra was widespread until the late thirties and early forties when it virtually disappeared helped by an increased understanding of this niacinamid malnutrition the improved food supply eradicated the disease the depression made cotton unsaleable and acreage for diversified food production was freed a late result of pellagra in many darkhued people was a patchy blanching of the skin in pellagra in other nutritional deficiencies and in disorders of the skin with other origin more or less striking pigmentary changes in the opposite direction occur endocrine disorders such as addisons disease resulting from reduced function of the adrenal glands and the normal change of hormonal balance in pregnancy cause more or less visible more or less localized increase of pigmentation when a cured skin disease leaves a face permanently speckled it sometimes becomes a matter of preference whether the white spots shall be tanned or the brown spots blanched for the lastmentioned purpose specialists have begun using an industrial compound monobensylether of hydroquinone valued as an antioxidant prolonging the life and reducing the color of rubber with time patience and skilled supervision some good results have been obtained as for causes a series of inheritable disorders are associated with lack of pigment widely known among them is albinism its generalized form is marked by milkwhite skin and whitishyellow or white hair lifelong and painful sensitivity to light and decreased visual acuity resuit from lacking eye pigments when exposed to sunshine over long periods albinos get the sunproduced skin cancers which are extremely rare in pigmented people generalized albinism is caused by a mutant gene a changed piece of dna deoxyribonucleic acid that occurs in both chromosomes of a specific pair another mutant gene causes localized albinism when present in one chromosome only dominant inheritance as distinct from the recessive inheritance of generalized albinism localized forms show as piebaldness or white spotting and white forelock terms used to describe irregular or symmetrical narrow or wide spots of white skin in the face or limited to trunk arms and legs in some instances a circumscribed depigmentation takes only a tuft of hair a third gene situated in the x chromosome deprives the retina of pigment in men carrying this mutant gene half the number of their daughters will carry the gene being themselves normal but for dotting and stippling of the eye fundus with pigment all human beings possess pigment cells called melanocytes distributed in the membranes of the brain in the eyes in the skin and mucous membranes and in the hair bulbs albinos are no exceptions but their melanocytes have lost their ability to produce pigment because they lack the enzyme tyrosinase the enzyme defect is not complete even in the generalized form of albinism it is limited to the white spots in partial albinism this partial or localized albinism can be more or less simulated by vitiligo or white spots with a mostly irregular distribution on trunk face and extremities though vitiligo often enough runs in families the mode of inheritance is obscured by similar conditions caused by environmental influences in another sense heredity may be at work when a cell and its descendants loose their enzyme production the forerunner of the melanocyte takes its origin in the primitive nervous system of the embryo from there nonpigmented cells migrate to the skin as observed with the electron microscope they contain minute grains loaded with the forerunner of the active enzyme these grains then mature to enveloped particles containing tyrosinase which converts the amino acid tyrosine to melanine the pigment of sun tanning and of ordinary hue in pigmented people normally all melanoblasts of an embryo carry the same genetic information if one of them undergoes mutation its descendant cells will carry the changed information and may give rise to pigmentpoor spots so much for abnormalities now to normal skin color and its fascinating quality of being divers it has become possible to study skin color objectively by use of the reflectance spectrophotometer an instrument that measures the percentage of light reflected from the skin at different wavelengths thus the degree of pigmentation is told in figures or in the form of a reflectance curve a skin of european type reflects per cent of the light if this has a wavelength of millimicrons and per cent at millimicrons for west africans the reflectance values at these two wavelengths are and these figures come from a recent work by harrison and owen in oxford england they studied the children and grandchildren of west africans with europeans and also the original population groups three or four chromosomes seemed to carry the chemical signals necessary to establish the observed pigmentary differences between west africans and europeans for our purpose this refined study mainly confirms the net results of earlier investigations the conclusions we can draw from these observations are two first pigmentation differences of the afroeuropean grade are inherited in a somewhat more complicated way than albinism and piebaldness the second conclusion leaves us perhaps chromosome pairsof the not directly concerned with sexfree from perceptible engagement in pigment manufacture further we must not think that the three or four chromosome pairs that carry dna information for pigmentation carry nothing else for all we know each of them has safely hundreds and very likely thousands of bits of dna information regulating other characters because we do not know for certain that the essential primary information for pigmentation is limited to just three or four gene pairs which may well be the case some caution is necessary in drawing the conclusion but for all we know and can reasonably assume a very small proportion of the genetic material takes care of color then color is unimportant to the forces of survival that make us keep or loose genetic material possibly but we cannot draw that conclusion from the relative scarcity of genes for normal skin pigmentation blood pigment hemoglobin takes little primary genetic information we cannot do without it color as so many other traits takes its directives from a limited number of molecules with many jobs to do and much information to store but the sum of these other bits of genetic information which regulate our body build and our life processes overshadows pigment genes in general importance turning now to groups of people we know that the genes for the common blood groups a b and o can be differently distributed we do not expect the place where a man worships to influence his genes but we are not overly astonished to hear that as a group muslims in southeastern india carry the b gene in per cent while their hindu neighbors have this gene in per cent religion has kept the muslims together as a group for a very long time they have founded families with their neighbors too rarely to mingle with them into one population with a common gene pool in precisely the same way a group of heavily pigmented group in kongo will because each constitutes a group of people mostly marrying within this group conserve its own proportions of genes for blood groups and other universal traits thus pigment like religion can affect the genetic endowment of a group indirectly by isolation this isolation is relative only let us also remember that it makes no difference if a person gets his a blood group gene from his african or from his european parent in either case it fits the corresponding bit of dna he gets from his other parent with the matching chromosome this other bit may determine blood group a b or o though the fact of common blood groups seems trivial at least to blood doners it serves to remind us of our common ancestry we differ a little but not much in genetic setup from our forebearsthe early toolmakers and now to a nice piece of logic that some of us recognize as an evergreen we are civilized our manlike forebears were primitive they were darkhued therefore people who are still heavily pigmented are more primitive than lightly pigmented people isnt that logic yes it is logic of a sort scotsmen are stingy so is joe smith therefore joe smith is a scotsman thats the same sort of logic and it is false our early forebears were very likely pigmented if we go back far enough we meet other traits that are kept in some ethnic groups and have been lost in others when evolution became a fertilizer of scientific thought a hundred years ago it established a ladder of life higher forms evolved from lower and highest of all rose man the conclusion that all men share the same humble origin and all belong to the same advanced species which is true was not enough for some deep thinkers they went a few steps further and discovered a ladder of lower and higher races being men of wealth and comfort they also found that the wealthy and comfortably established were the fittest though these pseudoscientific ideas met some notable setbacks when applied to human affairs they have for three generations permeated the notions of wielders of power with their foggy plausibility while superior and inferior carry no real meaning in our context it could be worth while asking if pigmentation or a notable lack of skin pigmentation could be favorable in a specific surrounding in other words what adaptive advantage is connected with pigment on the surface the question seems easy enough we either are or become pigmented when exposed to strong sunlight pigment absorbs light and thus the deeper layers of the skin are protected from inflammation and blistering in central africa in australia and southern india people are heavily pigmented and thus protected against the sun the advantage of being pigmented would show in an increased chance of having a normalsized family when living in these regions this seems to make sense even if it tells far less than the whole story if we turn the question and ask for the relative advantage of europeantype pigmentation we could accept the idea of a pigmentpoor skin letting through more ultraviolet light to its deeper layers thereby facilitating the production of vitamin d when sunlight is sparse so various grades of pigmentation could have advantages in different geographic regions and during tens of thousands of years humanity would become dispersed over the earth according to sunlight and color this does not explain the emergence of pigmentpoor people from heavily pigmented ancestral tribes we shall take a look at this problem before returning to the so far sketchy discussion of geographic distribution of skin pigmentation one thing we know about the genes that form us and regulate our life processes is that soonor or later they change one type of such changes or mutations was exemplified by the gene for generalized albinism one fourth of the children of this mutant gene become albinos when albinos marry one another a rare event all their children are albinos were it not for the decreased chance of survival of albinos under all known natural conditions extremely pigmentpoor groups of people could arise in this way when african and european populations are concerned each of a few genes contributes in a way not yet known in details a minor amount of pigment let us assume that long ago somewhere in africa one of these genes changed to produce a just discernible lighter nuance a carrier of this new gene would leave it to half his children if their just perceptibly lighterhued children in turn founded families one fourth of their offspring would be still poorer in pigment to these carriers of one mutant gene in duplicate very strong sunlight might have been hurtful if they sought the shadow of the rain forest they might have come upon abundant food resources helping their kind to survive and multiply but at least two other genes had to change in order to produce a really light skin if one or two genes of a hundred thousand mutates it could take thousands of years before small flocks and scattered tribes produced these additional mutations in effective quantities once relatively lighthued men and women with different mutant genes for pigment loss met and founded families still lighter offspring would result and a white tribe could finally emerge this is how a group of pigmentpoor human beings could be formed over a long period of time through forces we are well acquainted with but how could such groups survive grow in number and spread over wide geographical regions in view of the intense popular interest in pigment we know remarkably little about the advantage and disadvantage of color gradations in the need for protection against strong sunlight would seem to fit the distribution of very lightly pigmented people in northern europe perceptibly darker but still lightly pigmented people in southern europe and northern africa and heavily pigmented people in equatorial africa but what about the americas on both subcontinents the original inhabitants are pigmented but relatively lightly so and without any decided tendency for equatorial tribes to be more heavily pigmented the northern regions of america and asia are inhabited by pigmented people we have to question even the simple and plausible exploration of pigment variation as adaptive to sunlight true enough everything can be explained the arctic sunglare gives the darkeyed hunter an advantage without his rich eye pigmentation his sight would be blurred and he could not easily detect his quarry if sun does not suffice to account for the heavy pigmentation in africa another explanation comes handy the deep shadows of the tropical rain forest would allow the dark hunter to come close to his prey while a milkwhite apparition would attract a ghastly interest from the leopard this seems reasonable but then we ask why the pygmy tribes babinga ako mawambi and other forest dwellers are in fact yellowishbrown not black in africa we meet the darkest people on the savannas where pigment no doubt protects against the scathing sunlight again the bushmen living in the kalahari desert are not much darker than many southeuropeans without denying the adaptive value of pigmentation we keep asking if relative advantages such as those mentioned could thousands of years ago have sufficed to split mankind into differently colored tribes and peoples we could add to the list of disadvantages of being too lightly pigmented under the tropical sun the sunprovoked skin cancer of the elderly though by far not preventing white people from settling in tropical regions could cause some disadvantage to the flock we have evidence that humanlike forerunners of our species kept some elderly members of their families presumably for some useful purpose a disease shortening the lives of the elderly more often in white than in pigmented flocks could increase the risk of succumbing to catastrophs where the experience of old people could have opened a trail to survival this is possible but as evidence such speculations look rather thin from the study of blood pigments in african populations we know that one and the same gene can cause both advantages and disadvantages balancing each other such forces keep a population heterogenous a minor additional advantage for a mutant gene will in a limited number of generations virtually eliminate its originally normal partner gene allele we cannot deny the possibility that shades of pigmentation have in different environments long ago caused distinct advantages we also have good reason to question the largescale effect of such advantages all the time we must take into account the additional facts of clothing and protective paint before the human race went manlike toolmakers used scrapestones and mussel shells to prepare hides for clothing we must not assume that our forebears just waited to be bleached or tanned by chance mutations before going where they wanted to go then let us face the fact that we do not know of any clear and decisive disadvantage shutting off a land to people with sparse pigment or advantage opening it to heavily pigmented people pigmentation may never have played a major part in adjustment to any environment another fact remains that of a few billion people roughly assortable in pigmented and white so what other forces than those of natural selection could produce very dark and very lightcolored peoples a major catastrophe such as flood plague or famine could by mere chance leave a handful of black men and women to repopulate one region they would leave no brown descendants under similar circumstances in other regions white survivors could happen to become the founders of a tribe similarly if a desert prevents a lightly colored flock from intercourse with its heavily pigmented neighbors it may grow to a tribe or a people with its own light color such forces of chance very likely have been at play in the past they are still at work through skeletal remains and implements found in the earth we know that human flocks were scattered over the earth tens of thousands of years ago the first europeans to leave remnants lived years ago the first north americans years ago thus flocks of a few families have had time to grow large and diverse before we met them in history mother africa had space and warmth enough for all her manycolored children but we may surmise that heavily colored girls preferred men of their own hue when it came to founding a family when migrant flocks met lightcolored young people found each other and the combinations of genes necessary for white hue were secured such mating selection helps establish groups with distinct color or relative lack of color in a limited number of generations it was probably the strongest single force in the emergence of pigmentation differences if in addition slight adaptive advantages long ago helped establish black tan and white in their diverse regions they gave mankind an increased chance to survive should white succumb in the frosty outskirts of the world tan might survive but thanks to human sagacity and mutual assistance all shades of color survived today pigment or lack of pigment has only one adaptive advantage that of group acceptance like it or not mankind is changing its shell like a lobster with the propagation of universal techniques and ideas goes a desire to identify the own group to shelter its traditions and characteristics we know nothing about future groups units in a harmonious global society or flocks of cave dwellers in a world gone to wrack but we have had the color variant and may have matured to new standards for group identification if we are bent to take the idea of changing shell more literally we can contemplate the fact that mankind grows a little richer in pigment every day more than two thirds of the increase in the world population is contributed by pigmented people our view into the past is veiled and our vision of the future is dim but we can feel confident that color never meant and never will mean so much to human kind as we make of it in our own moment of anguish and struggle ours is only a glimpse of the long drama of life if we are to catch a little of its hidden meaning we must try not to be blinded by the trivial and the apparent dr carl a larson author of pigmentation is a graduate of the university school of medicine of lund university in sweden since dr larson has been a member of the staff of the institute of genetics at his alma mater heading the department of genetics dr larson has done research work in the fields of mental retardation and human genetics and lectured before international congresses he tells us that this article grew out of his concern over the discrepancy between the widespread interest in pigmentation and true knowledge about the functions of the pigment cell the december issue of negro digest featured dr larsons article the supreme race in which he concluded that such a label could only be applied to the race of man the new breed by peter oday within the black ghettoes of america a new genera tion is making its presence felt its presence has farreaching j implications for the survival of the society at large yet has r not been sufficiently described and explained by the many observers and writers of the black communities but perhaps the best way to understand it is not through the works of writers and scholars but through certain changes occurring within the fertile music of the black comunities rythmn and blues gospels and spirituals and to a lesser extent jazz comprise some of the most significant components of black culture in america within their sounds and lyrics are contained all the hurt pain and good times which black people share through their daily experiences there is hardly an area of community life which escapes the contact of this music and the musicians and vocalists through their sounds have come to function as powerful agents of moral and cultural influence on black behavior black music then is an integral thread which knits together invigorates and gives substance to the personal and collective experiences of the black masses however since world war ii and particularly since the midfifties important changes have begun to take place within black music the rhythms have become more varied and complex black artists are getting more and more way out with their sounds the form and expression of black music is taking off in all kinds of directions these changes can be readily seen in jazz with the emergence of such artists as ornette coleman albert ayler archie shepp and sun ra leroi jones writes how one of these artists wants to play past note and get them purely into sound into the basic element the clear emotional thing freed absolutely from antiemotional concept another more important change has been in the direction of a fusion between the blues and the spirituals it is now practically impossible to distinguish between the two the spirituals now contain the big beat and the blues the cries and humming of the spirituals the whole career of the late sam cooke in fact exemplifies this blend starting out with a gospel group the soul stirrers he later branched into rythmn and blues and continued to record and influence music in both areas until his death however the big hit the night time is the right time by ray charles and the raylettes is probably the prime single example of the blend between gospels and the blues produced in it marked the complete popularization of the gospelblues sound in the black community that sound so prevalent today is clearly distinct from the blues of earlier years the clovers the orioles charles brown and particularly the older country blues singers were producing a more secular song some of the older country blues singers in fact have reacted strongly against the more spiritual oriented blues singers of today it is well known how upset big bill broonzy was over ray charles as he said of ray hes got the blues hes crying sanctified hes mixed the blues with the spirituals i know thats wrong the mixture of the spirituals and blues the new expressions in jazz all are indications of deeply rooted ferment within black culture old forms are being discarded or improvised upon new different and freer forms are being created recently there was a side out called the new breed james brown in his hit recording papas got a brand new bag refers to a new breed beneath the pulsating changes in black music one can feel the absorption of new ingredients into black life one can discern the emergence of a new breed of black man making his influence felt over the black ghetto it behooves us then to ask who is this new breed what conditions have gone into his formation what kind of consequences does his presence have for the society at large what in effect is the new breed saying one way to begin to identify the emerging generation is through statistics reliable statistics tell us that one of the fastest growing population components in the united states today is the negro now living in cities who was also born in cities before world war ii most blacks lived in the rural south and most of those who did live in the north had been born in the south they all had direct contact with the south but today we find a completely new phenomenon large rapidly growing black populations who are indigenous to city life these homegrown urban populations while rural and southern in the culture transmitted by parents relatives and friends have had no direct contact with the rural south they are subjected to the rigorous ordeal of the urban way of life from birth and in that sense truly represent the new negro yet the statistics cannot give a complete picture for they omit the cultural social and human experiences which surround the emergence of urban blacks to get into a broader and deeper area of facts one must inquire into the black world itself into the belief and authority structures that have held together the black community in america every nation tribe or natural community is ruled less by external forces from without than by internal forces from within compulsive internal images in the form of beliefs and moralities deeply embedded in the collective experiences which a natural group has shared in common i regulate behavior among the members of the group and achieve thereby a necessary amount of cohesion and cooperation without which the group could not survive it is these internal laws generally called customs folkways and mores which make a person feel most comfortable among his own kind and less so among outsiders the security and reliability which they furnish to ones environment enables the development of his personality every man owes his life his moral and material condition to his family and nation for it is through these groups that he becomes human born helpless and dependent he wins control over himself only through the education and sustenance given him by his people our purpose here is to inquire into some of the vital internal forces that have traditionally structured the black community in america outside of a few exceptional cases it is widely acknowledged that black people from slavery to at least world war ii lived in a severely limited isolated and relatively static world the status of the black man at the bottom of white society was well defined and strongly entrenched the general orientation of his life and of his subjective mind was that which had been shaped by the slavelike conditions of the southern plantation system although after world war i many black people migrated to cities even those in the cities remained by and large a southern people the moral habits and cultural norms internalized in their consciences were essentially the same as those shared by their relatives and friends left remaining in the south the particular belief structures which we want to bring out are those buttressed by two prevailing authorities that of the church and that of the white ruling powers christianity as taught and administered by the folk and storefront preachers has always provided the dominant religious nourishment for the spiritualistic black masses the church its teachings and its activities have been not only the main religious institution but also one of the major social institutions of the black community now this is not to say that all black people went to church and lived by the bible for there has always been a large element of black sinners who have lied stolen and done wrong but the point is that even they did not really escape the church influence under which most of them came up in fact in most cases they probably looked upon themselves as sinners and almost certainly would never have challenged the divine authority of jesus or the bible life had just become too cruel and hard for them to remain in the church or to live according to its teachings they were wrong and knew it but if they ever decided to live right or if there ever was a right way to live it would be by the teachings of the church just as the divine authority of jesus was rarely questioned so was the authority of the white people to rule black people rarely questioned the black masses were so downtrodden so poor illiterate and ignorant and the white mans power over them so omniscient that any thought of their rising to an equal status with the white man could not possibly have been taken serious for long whether it was at home at church at work in the schools in government or in business the authority of the white man hovered over their lives it was always he who held the main strings to their well being in such a situation there was little alternative left for the black man except to acquire a slave mentality to look upon himself as inferior and upon the white man as superior and to accept the white way of doing things as the right way after all such an outlook corresponded to almost everything which he observed and experienced in real life true there were sporadic black rebellions but none of these seriously threatened the dominant position of the white powers in the end they probably only confirmed to most blacks that it would be impossible to break down the white mans domination over them the prevailing authorities of the church and the white man then were two dominant pillars of the traditional black world the beliefs and moralities which they imprinted upon black behavior severely constricted and stunted the mental and moral development of the black population however between the preworld war ii period and now many things have come to pass the depression two major wars erratic but large scale occurrences of industrialization and urbanization economic and employment stagnation etc it would be impossible to measure the influence which all these complex societal forces had upon the black community but one result is obvious namely that most black people have acquired a different basis for the existence of their community life this basis the slums of large american cities was to prove quite different from the type of life which black people knew previously in the agricultural south in the industrial cities the black people would have to adjust to more complex but still oppressive conditions of life the most farreaching consequence of this adjustment has been the breakdown in the traditional authority and belief structures of the black ghetto today the church and ruling white authorities no longer hold the grip they once held on the minds of the black population the christianity preached under the slave conditions of the south simply can not have any relevance or real meaning to the black youth coming up under the complex industrial systems of the cities young people today often know more about the world around them than do the preachers the religious teachings of the black preachers have now become no more than a means of deluding the ignorant black masses so that the preachers themselves can become rich new college trained sociologist preachers are attempting to fill the vacuum left by the increasingly outcast uneducated preachers but their formal style and presentation has no real attraction to black tastes thus the influence of the black church has steadily decreased as black preachers have failed to keep up with the time and demands of the younger generation another development of equal if not more significance is the rise to prominence of other religious groups particularly the nation of islam although these groups may not have been very successful in recruiting great numbers of negroes into their fold they have been very effective in disseminating their special ideas this means that they have questioned and repudiated some of the basic tenets of black christianity arguments against the divinity of jesus and the bible and the justice of the christian god which previously would have been taboo are now circulating freely within the black community and the result is easy to see a typical black youth today does not believe that he was bom into a world of sin that jesus died years ago for his salvation and that if he lives right now he will go to heaven when he dies if anything instead of believing that he owes god something he believes that god owes him something young people want to enjoy life now and are not prepared to suffer and endure as their parents did unaccustomed and unable to meet these requirements of the young generation the spiritual authority of the black church like the influence of its preachers has diminished the other belief structure to fall has been that of the authority of white domination as james baldwin has put it the american negro can no longer nor will he ever be controlled by white americas image of him the mental subjection the nigger stigma which the white power structure had imposed upon the black man is now a thing of the past a new pride in being black is growing lightskinned negroes who might formerly have tried to pass for white are now glad to be black negroes no longer conceive of the world as one in which the white man has to be on the top and the black man on the bottom for today there are black nations in africa and a powerful yellow nation in asia moreover militantly charismatic and popular leaders such as malcolm_x have revealed to the masses the responsibility of the white power structure for their downtrodden condition the white mans treachery hypocrisy and deceit in his exploitation of the black man has been brought into the open and his significance in a world populated by the darker races has been belittled thus the determination of the us government and military to win the war against the yellow people in vietnam tends to confirm the now prevalent opinion in the black community that the white man will do almost anything to maintain his domination over the darker races the black world has changed so dramatically since before world war ii that it would be impossible for a youth coming up today to have the same view of the world and himself which his father had in the turbulent lawless cities of america the rhythm of life is quicker and more varied and complex for the masses life becomes a game in which one has to learn at an early age to be flexible to scheme and hustle if he is to survive use or be used stay one up on people or theyll take advantage of you besides this necessity of scheming in order to make it one also becomes exposed and attracted to a wide variety of social sets storefront churches hustling on the streets with pimps and prostitutes black college crowds integrated civilrighters and beatniks the fingerpopping and good times groups black nationalists when one moves between any of these sets he has to go through changes he has to change roles to change his game so that he can get in on a particular set from hustle to hustle from set to set such is the pace of black life in the cities the chaos and disorder which is a part of it makes it easy to understand why some of the new jazz sounds are becoming chaotic for after all in these sounds the musicians are often expressing no more than the various personal experiences which they have known in the disorder of american living conditions it is also easy to understand how the spirituals become mixed up with the blues the black singers coming up through the church take their singing but not the religion serious eventually the forces of black life on the streets pull them into the world of secular music and they carry their church sound and feeling and sometimes even the church moralities into the blues the tense fast driving demands of the rat race in modern america is pushing negroes to do things which their fathers never would have thought of doing and this is changing their music and their whole way of life on the streets the young headshakers used to just talk aloud drink wine and steal from and fight among each other today besides drinking wine they are getting loaded on weed and other things instead of fighting among one another they are stabbing white people on the subways it is clear that the black nation today is in a state of profound flux the collective conscience of the people is being shaken to the very core of its being thereby causing black music and black culture to take off into so many different directions the pathos violence and disorder involved in this period of severe cultural and social disruption are often shocking to older generation negroes one oldtimer arna bontemps who had pleasant and memorable experiences in harlem during the negro renaissance of the twenties was shocked and frightened by the conditions he found on harlem streets in as he puts it at least one reason for avoiding harlem night streets in would have been the fear of muggers where poets went about singing in the days of the new awakening angry frustrated boys now prowled where primitive children had danced on the sidewalks hungry evileyed little criminals lurked in doorways outlandish cults were meeting in some of the housefront churches where the moaning and shouting had formerly been spontaneous and filled with joy what in gods name had happened actually those conditions bontemps was observing in were only the emerging conditions which produced the young generation of today the fright and shock is largely in his own mind because he is looking at a younger generation through the lens of the older generation the lawlessness which he observes is by and large no more than the breakdown of the cultural folkways and norms which he had known during his time although those norms may have provided some emotional and psychological security to his generation they cannot do so for the present generation because they do not apply to the social realities of today new folkways new mores are being developed but before they become structured the old ones must be vomited up this means a process of shock disruption and transformation it can be a violent and frightening process but it is not as destructive as bontemps puts it for there is a deeper more creative and constructive aspect to it for example one can note that with the destruction and breakdown of law that have occurred during the riots in black communities a deep sense of unity and brotherhood always asserts itself afterwards people who have been in a black community in the aftermath of rioting have witnessed how the residents become more polite to each other on the streets how they are not so quick to lose their temper with one another there is a steady growth in their sense of community and a profound realization that they are sharing a common cause and a common destiny the era of the new breed then is one of order in disorder clarity in confusion unity in disunity the forces of violence and destruction become superceded by those of liberation and brotherhood some have pointed out how negroes in throwing off the shackles of their slave mentality are responding to deep psychological needs for human dignity and selfrespect there is undoubtedly some truth to this but more should be added the changing attitudes among the younger generation are more than a psychological quest for human dignity they express also a greater will to power although many young blacks have come up in some of the worst kind of squalor and poverty in the country most of them still have not had to work as hard as their parents to make a living the young people today not only do not know what it is to labor all day in the fields under the hot sun they have no intention of doing so they are not willing to slave all day like their parents for only a few coins when they see white people all around them with easy jobs and a lot of money for these young people know how wealth success and prestige are really earned in white society the white man with whom they have had experiences is not the one who is openly evil but the one who is doublefaced who will smile in your face while he sticks a knife in your back in moving among the many social sets of the cities these ghetto blacks have come to find out that behind the rigid staid smile of the white woman is often no more than an insecure aggressive and sexually deprived girl that behind the overfriendly air of the white man is frequently a neurotic powerdriven adult with a childlike mentality negroes today know well the type of lives which white people really live and what they do behind the doors that is why unlike their parents they are not impressed by the examples set by white people their actual experiences have taught them that there is nothing genuine behind the examples and ideals of white society when a person has been turned out when he has experienced life as it really exists he just can not appreciate the artificial copy he reacts against phony sets and phony people this is the environmental situation of the new breed with his experiences under oppression and into the deeper and more subjective realms of life with his knowledge of the white world around him it becomes almost impossible for him to be moral in any conventional sense to have someone tell him to go to college so that he can get a good job to be patient and grateful until some charity organization gives him something is an insult if he wants something he will take it in whatever way he can and by any means necessary this is his will to power which goes beyond conventional morality the power attitude among the young breed is what makes them so violenceprone when the sun is hot when there is no place to go and nothing to do because you dont have the means it only takes a small incident of police brutality to set things off mass rioting and looting becomes an easy way to give vent to your pentup anger and frustrations and to get the things you want and need it is this threat of violence among the young breed which makes them a highly political group they are political not because they may like to go on demonstrations or engage in organized political activities but because certain of their actions have farreaching political consequences their willingness to use force and violence to get what they want upsets the traditional socioeconomic organization of american cities the white business and political leaders of the cities cannot stand for widespread looting and rioting because it means destruction of their properties and disturbing their political and social positions this they fear much more than they do peaceful demonstrations and thus become willing to make token concessions to the black community since the white power structure through its black spokesmen has lost its ability to control the black masses and keep them peaceful it has now recognized a necessity to do something quick good housing schools and jobsthese are the concrete essentials which the negro needs hence a host of shotgun crash programs the war on poverty neighborhood youth corps apprenticeship training programs neighborhood improvement centers etc yet it is becoming apparent that even these programs can not cope with the situation at hand one basic reason is that the private economy cant create enough jobs and decent houses for everyone but another more subtle reason has to do with the utilitarian nature of the solutions it is typical of white americans to reduce everything to matters of economic needs and basic commodities and to neglect thereby the related human factors after all when one deals with houses and jobs one inevitably must confront the people who are going to live in the houses and occupy the jobs so today when one talks about housing and jobs for negroes he sooner or later will have to face up to black people themselves which means facing up to attitudes of the younger generation and it is here at the attitudes and emotions of young blacks that the shotgun poverty programs are likely to fail for their wants are not easily satisfied if you offer a young black a job he might take it then again he might not he might not feel like working at the time he is too cool too resentful and too reckless to be easily satisfied he takes things in his own stride and is not prepared to shape up to the hasty and illprepared demands of the white man the attitudes dispositions and sounds of the new breed are with us no one can escape their influence the penetrating glares the pulsating rhythms the downtoearth heatthose elements which have always been a part of music and culturehave been reinvigorated and given a new distinct overall quality it is a quality which cannot be sufficiently described in words but whose end effect is unmistakably clear the end effect is one of completely unmasking the listener of piercing beneath artificial forms to the raw emotions and bare essentials the effect of new breed music is part and parcel of the total social situation created by the new breeders influence with the development of his style of life his actions and will to power everybodys front is broken and there is nowhere to hide the white ruling interest can no longer hide behind their promises and declarations of freedom democracy and racial equality no one believes their declarations any more now they stand fully exposed resting on nothing but naked power that power which was experienced so brutally by the black residents of watts and which operates so blatantly in vietnam and santo domingo the black socalled leadersthe preachers lawyers and entertainersno longer impress people with statements of what they can do and will do because everybody knows they cant back up what they say amid the masses of black people the field negroes stirred up by the younger generation have shed their slave mentality and stand face to face with their real plight in the country in the background one can hear the voices the shouts and cries of the new breed what is the new breed saying they are saying what the bible prophesied long ago we shall reap what our fathers have sown we are the last who shall be first the new breed has expressed a willingness to act they are hostile and restless ripe for militant black leadership can such leadership emerge this is the central question which the new breed poses to the black ghetto in america today the truth about negro crime by frank poague jr the past few months as in the past years we have v m been subjected to the alarming news of the negro crime i i rate in america headlines in local and national newspapers and magazines reports on radio and television have reminded awakened americans of this picture alabama to try protesters pickets arrested protesters arrested negroes arrested at greensboro arrests end threeday protest in alabama town killed in los angeles riot arrested these are just a few examples no intelligent person white or black can deny the fact that crime is more prevalent among negro americans in fact some white supremacists maintain that the negro is innately more prone to criminal acts according to a recent fbi report the states with the highest crime rates per inhabitants were nevada california and arizona vermont was lowest with five new yorks rate was arrest statistics for per cent of the population showed negroes arrested for murder and whites negroes arrested for negligent homicide and whites negroes arrested for forcible rape and whites negroes arrested for robbery and whites negroes arrested for aggravated assault and whites negroes arrested for burglary and whites negroes arrested for larceny and whites and negroes arrested for auto theft and whites these figures are alarming though only per cent of the u s population is negro more than half per centof persons arrested for violent offenses murders robberies and aggravated assaults are negroes even while data on criminal law causality was being painstakingly assembled the current public dialogue over u s crime returned again to two harsh facts that spring out of the statistics the high rate of negro crime and the high rate of juvenile crime we have learned to accept the latter as a form of societal disorganization but the negro crime picture is too much to accept without severe criticisms in a real sense said a former high ranking administration official to speak of crime today is to speak of negro crime yet the evidence of negro crime today does no more than reaffirm a truism of law enforcement that crime however universal its incidence is peculiarly nurtured by ghettos that will in most instances grow into slums i might point out here that extra care must be taken in interpreting criminal statistics in regard to race note for instance census and criminal statistics are based on the popular conception of race rather than on an anthropological differentiation crime of negroes against whites are treated with more concern by local officials than crime of negroes against negroes comparison of white and negro crime rate fail to take into account the differences between the population the higher prison commitment rates of negroes reflect in part the inferior community facilities and specialized institutions for those negroes who personify problems not usually included with the scope of crime and fbi statistics are weighted heavily by urban crime patterns of the north and west exaggerating incidence of negro crime to a degree one must not overlook those social conditions which make for the high crime rate among negro americans especially when crime is defined in terms of the application of the law we cant for instance overlook the fact that crimes committed by negroes are more frequently prosecuted than those committed by whites or that negroes are less well able to defend themselves legally they are less often in position to secure a good lawyer and they are more promptly sentenced to prison gunnar myrdal in his controversial american dilemma recognized long ago that at all times the stereotyped notion has prevailed that negroes have a criminal tendency which manifests itself in acts ranging all the way from petty thievery by household servants to razorslashing homicide statistics can be misleading roy wilkins executive secretary of the national association for the advancement of colored people recognized this when he said the records show the negro is more easily arrested than white persons dragnet arrests for a crime admitted by one or two persons frequently haul a dozen negroes to the jail and into the record books too often measurement of crime must be limited to those apprehendedundoubtedly not a representative sample of all criminals even the counting of apprehended criminals is crude and approximate at best because of the lack of uniformity in laws and in crimereporting over the united states furthermore any index of negro crime runs the risk of being inflated by discriminatory practices of the police the courts and penal systems to begin with the laws themselves may be discriminatory segregated legislation makes many acts a crime for negroes but not for whites for those reasons the indices which have to be used are best thought of as measures of apparent crime not crime per se according to a fbi report in negroes were arrested twoandahalf to three times more frequently than other americans proportionate to their percentage of the population for crimes like murder and nonnegligent manslaughter aggravated assault and gambling negro arrest rates were roughly five to seven times those of whites in many instances the police frequently pick up numerous suspects in connection with a single crime this is especially true in communities where negroes lack political influence in fact the negro is more exposed to the misuse of police power than any other group the police custom of arresting negroes on slight suspicion or of staging mass roundups of negroes is definitely related to the negros lack of security and his inability to exert political pressure against such abuses the feeling is widespread among criminologists race relations experts negro leaders and others that the negro crime rate is exaggerated because of discriminatory arrest practices on the part of law enforcement agencies they agree that negroes are more liable both to be suspected ofand to be arrested forcertain crimes than are whites dragnet arrests and illegal arrests are more likely to occur when negroes rather than whites are involved they agree further that after arrest negroes are less likely to secure bail and are more liable to be counted in jail statistics they are more liable than whites to be indicted and less likely to have their cases dismissed if tried negroes are more likely to be convicted if convicted they are more likely to be included in the count of prisoners negroes are also more liable than whites to be kept in prison for the full terms of their commitments and correspondingly less likely to be paroled perhaps with more impartial treatment by all lawenforcement units negro crime might be considerably reduced but differential treatment by the police and courts is not the whole story by any means involved in these perplexities must be thrown education discrimination by a large segment of the dominant white group family disorganization induced by the competitive struggle to survive in a society with few equal opportunities lack of community organization employment practices and despair in attempting to accommodate to urban life the question should be why will crime continue to be more prevalent among negro americans a simple answer to this question could be that negro crime will remain more prevalent as long as there is prejudice and discrimination and no solutions to the problems the negro faces as a predominantly lowerclass citizen negroes when compared with other americans are more often lower class and poor slum residents of the largest cities victims of family disorganization southern in origin young and unemployed and objects of extensive discriminationeach an important social correlate of crime apart from race family disorganization family disorganization is characteristic of the negro family in fact thomas pettigrew in his recent book the profile of the negro american holds that there may be a direct personality relationship between violent crime and the absence of the father in any event there seems to be little question that broken families regardless of race are one of the agents of crime in general an example of the extent of family disorganization among negro families in the south may be seen in the following table selfimprovement w begins at home by preston dewitt wiley sr all me an uncle tom if it makes you feel better i happen to believe that nothing in the glittering history of the negro revolution has failed so dismally as the zeitgeists failure in coming to grips with negro family deterioration the gap between the aims of the civil_rights movement and the welfare of the people is greater than ever if i were obliged to make a list of the most urgent problems facing the people of the united states in the field of social accommodation i would rank the disorganization of negro family life at the head of the list so much for perspective i have long preached albeit unsuccessfully that where there is no vision the people perish apparently current negro leadership cannot break the mode of its own doctrine to examine critically the generationsold habits of the northern negro and seek selfimprovement would be for them a return to the discredited uncle tom preachments of booker t washington it must be said sadly enough that the negro community has not always shown great enthusiasm for selfimprovement shrill cries by negro militants continue to drown out attempts by more responsible negro citizens to make a hardheaded appraisal of this most agonizing of americas social problems as a result the country is farther than ever from defining the boundaries of the problem one finds that today far too many negroes are bemused with the quaint view that somebody perhaps the federal government should do somethingshould seize the initiative and do it well and thoroughly that may be but by my lights the place to start is at the other end of townwithin the negro community let us be honest we negroes are not providing the answers and if we are not providing them because we do not have them then we need to ask whether we are doing enough to get them there is no question in my mind that beneath the surface there is disenchantment by many thousands of thoughtful negro americans who now sense the need to switch the civil_rights dialogue from the easily understandable aim of dismantling jim crow in the south to the comparably more difficult matter of the northern ghetto in this connection negro demagoguery notwithstanding it is plainly clear that negro riots in watts washington or new york acceleration of illegitimate birth emasculation of the negro male dominance of the negro female and the breakdown of negro family life which we have been talking about are all unarguable realities negro leadership can perform an enormous service if it will act on the premise that negroes want to be both negroes and americans maintaining their racial integrity while associating on the freest terms with all american citizens participating in american culture in its broadest sense and contributing to it in fullest freedom in addressing the question of how to equip negroes to deal effectively with the changed aspect of the zeitgeist it would appear that a stress on self help and racial solidarity emphasis on economic development and criticism of thinly disguised negro racism together with a continued strong plea for political and social freedom should manifest itself in constructive form meanwhile the process of education must go on while i have been accused since my piece conscience of a black conservative appeared in the january issue of negro digest of being more critical of negro progress than the facts justify my conviction is that negroes are not anxious generally to provide initiative for social construction within the negro community my further view which is part of a larger complex of ideas is based upon the conviction that the acquisition of wealth and moralityattained largely by our own effortswill determine the future destiny of negroes in this great country of ours the conviction i spoke of a moment ago becomes manifest in my use of the word conservative what i mean here is that there are overwhelming values american values if you willthat are being threatened by the excesses of the negro revolution the issues at stake are fundamental questions of moral and political philosophy being raised in american political culture to put the matter in perspective floyd mckessick of the congress of racial equality core recently insisted at a top administration conference on civil_rights that to alleviate the american negros plight the capitalistic system must be abolished whatever the pathology of the attraction one would like to see critical judgment brought to bear on this sort of thing surely it is the responsibility of negro leadership to assess the longrange consequences of its policies of denunciation would douglass or booker t washington really approve a politics of every snout at the public troughand longterm good sacrificed to the demands of the moment given a choice one suspects a majority of negroes will accommodate themselves to a growing emphasis on selfhelp as for the deterioration of the negro family the verdict is clear neither we nor any other people will ever be respected until we respect ourselves and we will never respect ourselves until we develop the inner strengths to live respectably this part of our destiny is in our own hands the laws which determine the destinies of individuals and nations are impartial and eternal we must deserve to be great break bias and poverty by elinor richey t sounds like an experiment primarily of interest to financiers actually the ones whose fates are riding on it are jobless negroes standing on street corners throughout the country the experiment is the u s economic development administrations new industry revitalization pilot project in oakland california early this year eda announced that because of dwindling industry and persistent high unemployment oakland had been designated a distressed area as minedout appalachia was designated two years ago to get industry humming again and the jobless working massive doses of capital would be injected into oaklands economy in the form of grants and lowcost loans for public works for new and expanding enterprises both the city government and private industry scrambled to apply for upwards of million to finance such public works as airport hangars and marine docks and industries ranging from an automotive assembly plant to a meteorological equipment concern a string is attached to these funds priority for jobs generated by edabacked enterprises and such jobs are expected to run into thousands must be given the longterm unemployed aid recipients must so pledge but what is significant is that the large majority of the jobless are negroes oaklands overall unemployment rate of per cent is more than twice the national rate of per cent but what shoots it up so high is that among the per cent of the population who are negroes between to per cent are idle since the federal government has resolved to enforce the pledges and with thousands of jobs of the goodpaying kind expected to result it appears large numbers of oakland negroes will be ushered from poverty to pocketjingling plenty moreover federal spokesmen say that if the remedy works on oakland other cities with high jobless rates which nearly means extrahigh joblessness among negroeswill receive the eda cure oakland presents a strong test case like many other negroes who moved to industrial centers seeking better times only to meet road blocks from unions and personnel departments oakland negroes have never really been admitted to the urban economy although negroes comprise more than a third of the citys population they hold but per cent of the local apprenticeship jobs per cent of the police force jobs and per cent of the nonteaching jobs with the school district janitoring laboring and kitchen jobs excepted these statistics typify their position in the decentpaying job market and gauge the strength of the color barrier that eda has tackled recruitments for world war ii shipyard workers built oaklands negro community when the shipyards closed negroes were denied a place in the peacetime industrial boom yet negroes continued to arrive part of the national trek to california they were obliged to compete for the already dwindling supply of domestic and laboring jobs and there wasnt nearly enough work to go around throughout the forties and fifties oaklands economy appeared to be in rosy health while industries frequently departed oakland new westwardmigrating subsidiaries replaced them new employers followed the discrimination pattern filling their personnel needs by hiring in the suburbs and out of state after all oaklands civil service on the excuse of a dearth of qualified applicants did the same oakland appeared to be getting away with ignoring its negro citizens of course by preventing them from supporting themselves by default it elected to keep them on welfare although oakland is californias fourth city in size its welfare load soon was tracking los angeles faring little better were oaklands other minorities minorities make up roughly half of the city especially the mexicanamericans and relocated indians beneath the surface oakland was sick and by the sixties was showing it industry departures had increased and newcomers were bypassing oakland with the same complaint as the departees expensive labor and skills shortages together with high taxes and land prices of course the former came of deliberately keeping union help in short supply by barring minorities while high taxes resulted from keeping citizens too poor to pay taxes thus shifting the burden onto industry moreover business was fleeing shopping streets were becoming gloomy strands of closed and for sale signs domestic servants and welfare recipients arent big spenders and the citys commuting labor force cashed their paychecks in suburbia and spent them there a market survey showed per cent of oaklands families had less than a year in purchasing power shortsighted as always the city government saw only symptoms instead of recognizing its mistake in forcing citizens into dependency instead of making them productive consumers city fathers imagined all that was needed was to woo back the high spenders and big taxpayers it spruced up the city with new public buildings and modern street lights while angling for new industry via a nationwide advertising campaign none of this worked and now the federal government has in effect declared an emergency while oaklands malady has been diagnosed correctly this time it doesnt mean a cure will be easy nobody expects oakland to passively surrender its prejudices moreover not only has unemployment multiplied numerically over the past two decades but jobs have grown more demanding if the government is to require that employers hire the jobless there must be qualified applicants waiting on the bench to qualify for the jobs many of the jobless will need training to provide it the government has set up a million skills center which like those already operating in detroit and chicago will combine reading and writing with vocational training courses will range from six months to two years with enrollees receiving living allowances of from to while they train but many jobs also require a union card oakland labor unions have maintained the fiction that they dont discriminate its just that some cant pass their apprenticeship tests negroes and mexicanamericans have charged that union screening is designed to shut them out not the least of the skills centers functions will be to prepare applicants to pass apprenticeship screening eda men have been holding conferences with oakland labor officials asking their cooperation in the skills center and jobcreating project but while inviting volunteer compliance federal spokesmen have warned that if a hiring agent whether an employer or a labor official seeks to violate or circumvent the requirement that edagenerated jobs go to the jobless effective persuasion will be brought to bear eda agents are readying an arsenal of effective persuaders among them is the new equal employment opportunities commission which has the responsibility of enforcing the provisions of the civil_rights act that bars racial discrimination in jobs the commission headed by franklin d roosevelt jr is empowered to obtain court injunctions ordering employers or unions to desist from discriminatory practices should an edabacked work project fail to hire a qualified minority person the commission can file an injunction against the employer or if a union were the hiring agent the union would be the injunction target the commission might also act against a union which unjustly turned down a skills center graduate for an apprenticeship program roosevelt visited oakland in march to instruct minority leaders and others how to file complaints with his agency which may act only when a specific complaint has been made the department of labor is in a position to crack down with economic sanctions it can cancel federal contracts with firms that practice job discrimination but eda is exploring other ways of enforcing the job pledges not the least of which is synchronizing the flow of subsidy with an employers cooperation with edas goals assisting eda in plotting strategy for employing the enforcement arsenal is dr floyd hunter the eminent negro sociologist and author his crack berkeleybased research firm has been tapped by eda to conduct planning research and evaluation for the oakland job creating project dr hunter who has called oaklands city government a coordinating effort for the business community and who once conducted a housing discrimination study for the city that was so accusatory of his employers that they suppressed it will keep an eagle eye on edabacked enterprises to make sure their hiring practices measure up as added insurance oakland civil_rights organizations are planning persuaders of their own leaders such as naacp president clinton white and mark comfort of the oakland direct action committee plan to maintain a continuing watch over hiring if an employer violates his pledge he may find his operation paralyzed by a mass demonstration far from being unique the plight of oaklands negroes is merely part of a general dismal western situation a report on negro workers in western states recently issued by the bureau of labor statistics showed only seven in had professional technical or managerial jobs as contrasted to the white rate of per more than per cent of western negro workers have lowpaying unskilled or semiskilled jobs compared with per cent of the white workers demonstrating that it is nearly as easy for a negro to become a doctor as to enter a union were statistics showing the entire west had negro plumbers and negro doctors no doubt the watts riots goaded this long overdue federal crackdown on job discrimination but it was also spurred by reports of two of president johnsons advisory groups his commission on automation warned that the present ratio of two jobless negroes to one jobless white will rise to five to one by if negroes continue to hold the same proportion of jobs in each general occupational category as they do now and the presidents council of economic advisers have computed the cost to the nation of racial discrimination in employment their figures say that if negroes were assimilated into the work force labor productivity would rise billion oaklands error is the nations error in microcosm in the work of negro writers by horace r cayton are all imprisoned within our culture it is almost impossible to break through the customary ways of perceiving the world about us in order that we may question in a fundamental sense the values held by society sometimes a new critical perspective of society and its culture is stimulated by powerful ideological developments which throw new light on the everyday world of events a new perspective can lead to insight and change these revelations come to philosophers scientists political leaders and above all to the artist and of all the artists it has been the writer who from the beginning of time has fashioned various brave new worlds the creative process of the writer is difficult to describe and understand it may be said that all men dream of freedom but it requires the powerful revelation and perception of the artist to capture these dreams and put them into shape we must understand the influences of various ideological forces as they have touched the perceptions and insights of negro writers if we are to understand the prophets and poets of the new negro in contemporary american society among the most crucial and fundamental forces affecting the negro writer have been those of psychoanalysis and the several disciplines of the social sciences i am a sociologist by training and a writer by temperament many sociologists consider me one of them and i usually tell them i am a writer when writers think of me as a writer i tell them im probably more of a sociologist and this leads me into a fundamental concern the question of identity i shall start with an autobiographical statement perhaps because i have recently completed an autobiography i was born in seattle at the turn of the century i discovered at a very early age perhaps three or four that i was a negro and i became aware that i would always be one and that negroes would always be underprivileged and stigmatized a group of people set apart i also knew that i was an american and in school as well as in the home i learned that america had a dream of freedom these two identities both of which i had internalized seemed to be in constant conflict when i became aware of the conflict i was confused allen wheelis in his book the quest for identity writes nowadays the sense of self is deficient the questions of adolescence who am i where am i going what is the meaning of life receive no final answers nor can they be laid aside the uncertainty persists the period of being uncommitted is longer the choices with which it terminates more tentative personal identity does not become fixed does not therefore provide an unchanging vantage point from which to view experience man is still the measure of all things but it is no longer the inner man that measures it is the other man specifically it is the plurality of men the group and what the group provides is shifting patterns what it measures is conformity it does not provide the hard inner core by which the value of patterns and conformity is determined the hard inner core has in our time become diffuse elusive often fluid more than ever before one is aware of the identity he appears to have and more than ever before is dissatisfied with it it doesnt fit it seems alien as though the unique course of ones life had been determined by untoward accident commitments of all kinds social vocational marital moral are made more tentatively longterm goals seem to become progressively less feasible wheelis continues to observe that identity is a coherent sense of self it depends upon the awareness that ones endeavors and ones life make sense that they are meaningful in the context in which life is lived it depends also upon stable values and upon the conviction that ones actions and values are harmoniously related it is a sense of wholeness of integration of knowing what is right and what is wrong and of being able to choose the past half century has encompassed enormous gains in understanding and in mastery but many of the old fixed points of reference have been lost and have not been replaced the insecurity i felt as a childtorn between what i had been taught and what washas now spread to all society while i found to an extent an identity other negroes and the whole american society remain confronted by this question richard wright and ralph ellison were fascinated with what herbert hill describes as that vast senseless social order which destroys its victim and which poses the necessity to remain sane in a society where the individual personality is denied and the world appears devoid of meaning hill goes on to say that essentially the framework for native son one of the important novels in contemporary american literature is to be found in its implicit assumption that the social order is directly responsible for the degradation of the negro that american society produces conditions which distort and destroy individual human beings who are part of an oppressed group the character in the book who functions as wrights spokesman states taken collectively they are not simply twelve million people in reality they constitute a separate nation shunned and stripped and held captive within this nation devoid of political social economic and property rights the loss of identity ultimately leads the individual to a state of alienation both from himself and from the society at large he is then constantly preoccupied with the seeking of the self and this is where his time and energy are spent several negro intellectuals have protested against this thus saunders redding has written the obligations imposed by race upon the average educators and talented negro are vast and become at last onerous i am tired of giving up my creative initiative to these demands before considering the psychological effects of american culture on both the blacks and the whites i shall touch briefly upon the historical aspect of the negro it is unique in terms of world history i subscribe to the school of thought that little very little of african culture was brought to the united states and that that which the negro did retain was isolated and died a rapid death what i am saying is that the socalled american negro subculture is purely a product of the negros experience in america it is the american culture refracted through the prism of years of subordination e franklin frazier in his last book the negro church describes the slow growth of cohesiveness in the negro community the cruelty of the plantation system did not even permit the development of a stable family group it was the negro church that first brought some cohesion to the negro it was many years before negroes as a group could even envision a free world certainly there were slave revolts and insurrections but it was not until the negro as a group began to have revelations similar to the one i experienced upon learning that at port arthur in the japanese a colored race had defeated the russians predominantly a caucasian nation that the negro began to search for his identity for a definition recognition and purpose the only way to analyze the position of the negro in america is to anaylze the culture in its entirety america has failed to develop a meaningful way of life that could make our country great a way of fulfilling the vast areas of our individual personalities that are unused and truncated this is evidenced by the indescribable loneliness that pervades our existence we have embraced and are the victims of a configuration of shoddy values the getrichquick compulsion and our surrender to the bitch goddess of material success our emphasis is on sex for gratification rather than deep organic emotional expression experience and communication we are unable to formulate a meaningful religion in spite of frenetic churchgoing and unable to rid ourselves of an archaic economic system that defies all laws of logic humanity and downright common sense and this in the most bountiful country in the world a country birthed in principles both noble and bold familiarized to us all as the american dream american culture places high value on appearances and beautyby all means one must be beautiful must conform to the stereotyped norms of socalled anglosaxon beauty and appearance along with this anglosaxon appearance comes the puritan ideology engulfing one in attitudes such as cleanliness is next to godliness but the next step in this train of thought as it applies to the negro is quite obvious he is made to feel dirty and consequently evil from the point of appearance alone the negro is not in step with the established and accepted norms and perhaps it is at just this point that a negro first begins to develop his sense of shame over his very blackness the black boy or girl learns much more early than we realize that there is something wrong with him that he isnt just an ordinary person that he has a stigma which he must live with for the rest of his life this sets up great waves of shame that engulf the entire personality the whole physical and psychological being the reason for the allpervasiveness of the feeling of shame is that shame has no specific focal point for cause shame is the result of a vague overall rejection the reasons for the rejection are irrational and without structure shame all too frequently has unknown roots i knew that shame was something i had to fight and for a group of people who have lived for hundreds of years as a shamed people it almost takes a conversion in the form of a religious experience to overcome that sense of shame accompanying the feeling of shame is a reaction pattern a theory which i developed in a sort of interaction between richard wright and myself it is what i have called the fearhatefear syndrome let me begin with a certain negro girl the only one that dared to enter an allwhite school walking the gauntlet of her fellow students who formed a double line and spat in her face as she passed that picture was on the front page of the new york times and but a few hours later was reproduced not only in pravda and izvestia but in paris london the scandinavian countries and in all of the nonwhite countries of the world including those we try to buy with socalled foreign aid as a writer i try to imagine what went on in this cruel drama what did the negro girl do when she got home what gave her such dignity and poise and what of the little white girls who had performed this ritual of spitting surely we have fouled our nest we have corrupted our children do you wonder then that there are black muslims in the united states who have found relief from this situation by openly hating all white people let me confess although i am for human dignity and would fight for whites if they were abused humiliated and spat upon there is a residue of hate in my heart as i think there is in most negroes living in the united states to explain this i developed a theory several years ago i wrote a speech in which i tried to state in technical terms what i believed to be the psychology of many negroes at that time although it is perhaps currently changing i quote i am convinced that at the core of the negros mentality there is a fearhatefear complex my assumption is that all men in western european civilization have unconscious guilt and fear of punishment for this guilt in the case of the dominant group this guilt is to a large extent irrational it can be shown to be false a figment of the imagination a holdover from early childhood experiences guilt can more easily be resolved by psychiatric treatment or even by rational cogitation but in the negro the psychological problem is ever intensified for him punishment in the actual environment is ever present violence psychological and physical leaps at him from every side the personality is brutalized by an unfriendly environment this reinforces and intensifies the normal insecurity he feels as a person living in our highly complex society such attacks on his personality lead to resentment and hatred of the white man however the certain knowledge that he will be punished if his hate emotions are discovered only compound this fear this is the negro reaction to his own brutalization subordination and hurt it is this vicious cycle in which the american negro is caught and in which his personality is pulverized by an evermounting selfpropelling rocket of emotional conflict the negro has been hurt he knows it he wants to strike back but he must notthere is evidence everywhere that to do so would lead to his destruction each of us is well aware of the brutalities that happened only yesterday i shall speak autobiographically to make my point more vivid my father was born a slave when i think of it now it is unbelievable that the body of my father could have been bought and sold like an ox or a horse i remember hearing in my childhoodi was tenof a negro who was lynched his genitals were cut off his living body then he was chained to a tree and burned alive they tied his carcass to a car and dragged it down the main street of the town do you doubt that that left a scar on my soul that some vestige of hate and fear remains although i have gone through psychoanalysis and am emotionally committed to the democratic ideal i learned that my problem as a person was no different from that of the japanese or the mexican i learned that it was the basic problem of adjustment to rejection and fear subordination whatever the cause produces the same result when that subjection is based on force and violence the inevitable product in the human personality must be fear and hate how has the negro dealt with his feelings of shame there are several paths open to the negro perhaps the one most in evidence today is the mass rejection of shame as the members of the mass strengthen each other by real or symbolic acts there is another path it is the redefinition of the past by discovering a more glorious past as it was imagined to have been in africa and of course there have been various negro nationalist movements from time to time i first saw this phenomenon when marcus garvey came to seattle to lead a nationalist parade garvey organized a million black americans and although his goals were foolish the pride he stirred in black hearts was very real i was just a young man then for it was back in the late twenties there had been a parade down second avenue the main street of seattle and thousands had followed their leader their messiah who was to lead them back to africa and to freedomthe honorable marcus aurelius garvey dcl founder of the black universal negro improvement association a selfeducated eloquent and fanatically zealous jamaican in the parade were negro women in the uniform of black cross nurses and others who wore wrapped puttees of the african motorcycle corps and in front the royal african legions rode on horses it was ludicrous and laughable but the black washerwomen were deadly serious and the black men laborers and servants had a pride that raised the demonstration out of the absurd and struck fear or admiration in the watchers on the dark faces for the first time there was pride and joy and fulfillment reflecting limpid faith in the completeness of living which they had found later on at a meeting at the star theatre i heard garvey deliver in deep resonant tones their slogan one god one aim one destiny for the garveyites he was a savior a messiah who promised to snatch them from the edge of the abyss and turn their grief into greatness he had put steel in the spines of negroes who had previously been ashamed of their color i tried to tell my parents about it later but when i described fat black washerwomen in tight motorcycle pants they laughed and i quickly stopped them saying dont laugh they were proud this is the first time i have ever seen negroes walking down the streets of a white city with pride and dignity the garvey movement was the only real mass movement among american negroes and it was based on glorifying things black the garveyites were going to have black cross nurses rather than white cross or red cross nurses a black house rather than a white house a black star steamship line rather than a white star line it was ludicrous certainly but it fulfilled a deep hunger in the hearts of more than a million american negroes a valid hunger a hunger that still exists in the or years since garvey that hunger has deepened been made more acute if america does not allow the negro to find pride in himself as an american then he will inevitably seek acceptance as a black man as for the black muslims their goals are just as foolish as garveys but they are appealing to the same hunger in that sense they are on valid ground i will not join them although i have been tempted i still hope for forgive me if i seem naivethe fulfillment of the american dream for all people no matter what color i havent given that up yet james baldwin writes to his nephew in my dungeon shook please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but their inhumanity and fear there is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept them with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it our failure to achieve a mature culture in which negroes and whites alike can accomplish some aspect of personality integration has within it the seeds of political fascism and if the emotionally truncated lives of negroes lead many of them to give up a fruitless struggle and submit to the certainty of a harsh dictator many whites in their immature longing for a meaning to their lives and for a security they have not been able to find act in a manner that would indicate they too are longing for the strong though cruel father who will dictate the functions of their lives there is another ideology that has profoundly affected the american negro the communist movement in the united states seized upon the scottsboro case and the crisis of the depression as a golden opportunity to seek recruits among negroes according to rayford logan soon after world war i the communists sought to win the support of negro workers in the north however the communists sixth world congress made a fatal mistake when in it resolved to work toward the formation of a separate black nation within the united states an overwhelming majority of negroes had no more desire to settle in a separate nation than they had to go back to africa but the communists sensing the propaganda value of the scottsboro trials stole the scottsboro case from the naacp and made violent attacks on w e b du bois who as editor of the crisis brilliantly exposed the fraudulent program of the communist party since most negroes knew of the work of men like du bois and had never heard of marx or lenin and also since they were fundamentally loyal americans despite their secondclass citizenship this communist maneuver won little confidence among negroes even in after five years of the depression and before the new deal had begun to reach down to negroes i estimate that less than negroes were members of the american communist party out of a total of party members the frequent shifting of the communist party position on the negro question after repeated the failures of the previous years and prevented the communists from building a permanent base within the negro community as professor wilson record has aptly said in his authoritative study american negroes refused to succumb to a siren song sung in bass quite apart from the failure of the communists to organize negroes they did provide a tremendous stimulant to the thinking and writing of negroes first the russian revolution itself startled the civilized world then when the communists started working with american negroes they offered them the hope that if black and white would unite there would be a free world this stimulated negroes to a further reconsideration of the possibility of a more meaningful existence but few negroes were aware of the depth of their distrust toward the whites besides the communist party in america used incredibly poor tactics the fundamental fact was that the negroes simply did not trust the white working class and its discriminatory labor unions and they did not trust them for good reason for the white working class had traditionally been the negroes enemy and in this there has been no fundamental change but the issue for some was more complicated thus richard wright for example a mississippi boy caught some vision of a different world as the result of the marxist influence he envisioned a world in which he could walk with dignity and he was for an important period of his life seduced by the communist vision which in a sense defeated the great potential that was his for his eventual disenchantment with the communists caused him to devote much of his later life and energy fighting them because they had tricked and lied to him that same energy might have gone into brilliant literary work yet one cannot ignore the fact that the communist party with all its failures still had immense influence on wright as a writer in his blueprint for negro writing published in the new challenge wright said in the lives of negro writers must be found those materials and experiences which will create a meaningful picture of the world today many young writers have grown to believe that a marxist analysis of society presents such a picture it creates a picture which when placed before the eyes of the writer should unify his personality organize his emotions buttress him with a tense and obdurate will to change the world and in turn this changed world will dialectically change the writer hence it is through a marxist conception of reality and society that the maximum degree of freedom in thought and feeling can be gained for the negro writer further this dramatic marxist vision when consciously grasped endows the writer with a sense of dignity which no other vision can give ultimately it restores to the writer his lost heritage that is his role as a creator of the world in which he lives and as a creator of himself i am inextricably concerned with the problems of the negro and with the possibility of enriching the american culture so i must act in some fashion for a tremendous racial confrontation is taking place confrontation is on old and honorable word which has recently come into current usage it means a direct facetoface meeting of people or peoples with conflicting interests ideas or values which must be resolved a confrontation may be resolved by a synthesis of these conflicting ideologies or beliefs or it may result in avoidance isolation or violence a confrontation is always a tense meaningful and fateful phenomenon me the snares of death confronted me is the text of psalms how much time have we to convince the americans and the world that democracy does not mean white domination not much i believe that the negro must get himself into positions of power we need laws and the continuation of picket lines and demonstrations to awaken our people and the whole of american society id like to quote richard wrights introductory essay to dr st clair drakes and my book black metropolis will the negro in the language of andre malraux find meaning in his humiliation make his slums and his sweatshops his modern cathedrals out of which will be born a new consciousness that can guide him toward freedom or will he continue as he does today saying joblike to the society that crushes him though it slays me yet will i trust in it this for richard wright was a rhetorical question long before many he had sensed the dictates of history if james baldwin is the poet of the negro revolt richard wright was its prophet in wright wrote the text of a picture book entitled million black voices which was both poetic and prophetic in it he stated we black folk our history and our present being are a mirror of all the manifold experiences in america what we want what we represent what we endure is what america is if we black folk perish america will perish if america has forgotten her past then i let her look into the mirror of our consciousness and she will see the living past living in the present for our memories go back through our black folk of today through the recollections of our black parents and through the tales of slavery told by our black grandparents to the time when none of us black or white lived in this fertile land the differences between black folk and white folk are not blood or color and the ties that bind us are deeper than those that separate us the common road of hope which we all have travelled has brought us into a stronger kinship than any words laws or legal claims look at us and know us and you will know yourselves for we are you looking back at you from the dark mirror of our lives what do we black folk want we want what others have the right to share in the upward march of american life the only life we remember or have ever known the lords of the land say we will not grant this we answer we ask you to grant us nothing we are winning our heritage though our toll in suffering is great the bosses of the building say your problem is beyond solution we answer our problem is being solved we are crossing the line you dared us to cross though we pay in the coin of death the seasons of the plantation no longer dictate the lives of many of us hundreds of thousands of us are moving into the sphere of conscious history we are with the new tide we stand at the crossroads we watch each new procession the hot wires carry urgent appeals print compels us voices are speaking men are moving and we shall be with them a scary story by nanina alba know i nuster

diane apliv r rs nelson had been to the kitchen to check on her or the screen door would have been latched when libby arrived she put her wallet on the window sill tied an apron around her short skirt and took out the bowl she used to mix biscuit dough she worked quickly her fingers measuring and stirring from habit her ears barely listening to the nelsons voices in the front room she put the biscuits in the oven and was bringing the breakfast dishes from the cabinet to the dining nook when mrs nelson came in to say good morning although the curlers had been taken from her hair she had not yet covered the dryflakesofoatmeal skin with makeup mrs nelson always seemed to stand in the middle of a busy room and after a year libby had become skilled in working around her libby mrs nelson turned her pale body toward the stove todays my club meeting day dont forget we have three tables this time mrs henderson has two ladies staying with her and ive invited another guest libby nodded her head and set the timer for the eggs as mrs nelson breathed heavily behind her back libbys features assumed the mask of pretendlistening is wicker over his cough yet mrs nelson leaned over and pinched a piece of biscuit dough that had fallen on the enamel top of the stove its too bad hes not going to be healthy like hal she said thats one good thing i can say about hal he was healthy enough to stir up devilment she dropped the dough into the stepon garbage can beside the stove libby lets have the watermelon pickle with the biscuits i want to use up this jar before it spoils libby nodded and walked toward the pantry sometimes she hated having to take things mrs nelson gave her ever since shed given wicker that old blanket to keep him warmer when he had the flu she thought she owned him she always said she was taking care of him hoping he didnt turn out like his father mrs nelson continued to talk as she walked to the other side of the kitchen i told his aunt he was going to be no good she said leaning inside the refrigerator spending all that time fooling around with papas old car youd think if he wanted to be a mechanic hed stay around here and learn the trade he could still be working at the esso station but no he decides to change jobs you know she turned toward libby i still wonder why he didnt marry that little thompson girl they were two of a kind mrs nelson looked distastefully at her fingers that were sticky from the biscuit dough hurry up she said wiping her hand on a towel mr nelson has to leave early libby ignored her mrs nelson was always saying mean things about hal and libby had the hardest time holding her temper every time libby thought about the woman pumping her friend sally about things that did not concern her she got plain angry just because sally worked for mrs henderson mrs nelson thought she could poke her nose into libbys business libby didnt understand why mrs nelson didnt come right out and ask if she were married she could understand how the woman might be curious about where hal was living but that gave her no reason for spreading lies going around making people think all libbys five children were bastards god you cant trust none of them she said poking extra hard inside the pickle jar with the spatula according to sally mrs nelson had asked about the identity of the father of libbys baby she hinted sally said that libby bought herself a wedding band instead of hal giving her the ring libby took the biscuits out of the oven and began buttering the insides the funny thing was she honestly thought mrs nelson had believed her when she said her husband was up north working she hadnt lied really the last postcard she had from hal said he was working in a canning factory upstate she saw no reason to say that card had been written almost a year ago during her working hours she tried to avoid thinking about her husband calvin had been nothing but a baby when he left at first she figured he only had left them for the summer lots of fellows she knew up and took off for a couple of months but they usually came back in the fall not hal he didnt ever do anything according to a set pattern one day he was working in the drug store and coming home and loving her at night and the next thing she knew he was off and gone again some people just have a wandering bug in them she looked around her at the sunlit kitchen comparing it to the narrow kitchen in her own home sometimes meetrie didnt believe her when she told the children about the food the nelsons had for breakfast talking about bacon and waffles made meetries eyes shine for real she would ask pulling her top pigtail for real and sometimes when she was pouring those cornflakes into the four cups and stretching the powdered milk with more water than the welfare lady ever intended she didnt believe herself this morning when she had tied a dish towel around wickers neck and sat down to spoon feed him his corn flakes meetrie made a regular nuisance of herself waiting for his leftover cereal asking every five seconds if he had finished eating every day this week she had come walking into mrs nelsons house exactly on time and every day mrs nelson came into the kitchen to see if she possibly could come a little earlier she put the eggs into the coddies and picked up the butter to carry to the table she had left her own house in a mess as usual yesterday was so rainy the doors stayed shut all day and the odor of urine from the childrens room invaded the whole house but she was not at home now she was working in another house nudging the swinging door with her elbow she pushed her way into the dining room as libby washed the breakfast dishes the kitchen seemed to become uncomfortably hot mrs nelson cleared the table and brought the last dishes to the sink did you take wicker back to the doctor she took the cups from mrs nelson when i took him the first time the doctor said it was hay fever and hed probably outgrow it it seemed to libby that if mrs nelson were so concerned about wicker she would suggest bringing all the children to play in her backyard during the day that way libby could keep an eye on them herself libby let the dishwater drain and rinsed her hands and face in cold water to cool off if mrs dickens didnt soon move calvin from the laundry basket on her porch the sun would be shining right into his face every morning when she put him and the clean diapers into the basket she found herself wishing her mother were well enough to look after the baby although with that last sickness coming back off and on she didnt feel right saddling her mother with her own problems she had asked mrs dickens if she could leave calvin inside the house but according to mrs dickens sixthirty was too early to be fooling with a baby besides shed said everybody around heres got too many babies to have to steal one off my front porch in the middle of the day right when libby was glazing the ham mrs nelson insisted on having a hot lunch what upset her most about the woman was the way she could come up with more work when libby was busiest mrs nelson was good for thinking up foolishness especially if it meant working overtime usually libby didnt mind staying late without notice except once she stopped puncturing the ham with cloves to count back it must have been two christmases ago and she wished she had that three dollars now she saved for months to buy hal a new fishing rod and had managed to put one in layaway then on the last day that she could make a payment before the store put the rod back into stock mrs nelson made her stay late to help with the church baking sale all the while she was icing those simple santa claus faces she was watching the clock hands pass the stores closing hours then when she was ready to go home mrs nelson gave her a small bag full of broken pieces and cookies that were too brown to sell she put the ham into the oven and opened a can of tomato soup for mrs nelsons lunch at home about now meetrie was scavenging around the neighbors fruit trees for apples since libby never knew what fruit would be there for the picking she always left out cold boiled potatoes for the children to eat sometimes there was enough food to make a sandwich for them to share during the afternoon when mrs nelson was safely away taking minutes of the bridge club meeting in the living room libby pulled out a bundle of roughdried clothes from a shelf in the pantry once a week usually when mrs nelson was spending the morning away from home she did her wash and some of her mothers clothes in the electric machine hers was such a paltry weekly wash she smoothed the iron over a long piece of embroidered ribbon meetries favorite possession here and there the colored threads were becoming unwoven but meetrie would rather wear that ribbon than anything in the world hal brought it home for her to wear to sunday school and there had been enough left over to make a bracelet for meetries slender arm now the folded ribbon that she tucked into a blouse pocket looked as if it might disintegrate into shreds at five oclock libby folded up the ironing board tucked the clothes behind the cake boxes on the bottom shelf and began counting out plates for the cold buffet she was soaping a heavy mixing bowl in which shed made potato salad when she heard a noise in the backyard noises that time of evening never disturbed her she imagined one of the neighborhood dogs was loose although mrs nelson swore up and down she would get rid of the next animal that dug up her chrysanthemum bed she had begun rinsing the silver when she thought she heard footsteps approaching the house for no reason at all she felt chilled but then the footsteps stopped and she knew she was being silly this time of year she had seen lots of people wandering through the neighborhood looking for odd jobs or something to eat besides the kitchen had become too steamy and warm to do anything but settle into the quiet routine of cleaning when mrs nelson came through the swinging door carrying the last of the dessert plates she involuntarily jumped why libby what on earth is wrong with you you jumped like a scared rabbit cat nothing maam i guess im tired from this heat with the inside of her arm she wiped the perspiration from her forehead that husband of yours should get himself home mrs nelson said intently watching her face and sliding the dishes into the sink goodness girl she popped her fingers again into the dishwater this water is ice cold then as if she had not interrupted herself she turned toward libby with him home you wouldnt have to do both your work and his libby nodded her head the way she always did mumbled something that sounded like yes maam and busied herself arranging the kitchen curtains until she was certain mrs nelson had left the room she stored the silver in the chest put away the company china and went to see if mrs nelson had anything else for her to do the door to the downstairs bedroom was closed and since mr nelson usually ate thursday dinner in town she was finished for the day she returned to the kitchen and picked up two waxed paper packages she had stuck behind the serving bowls in the cabinet she dropped them into a paper bag and cautiously opened the refrigerator door she counted the leftover salads decided against taking any and saw how much sliced ham was left after slipping four large slices into her bag she checked the front and side doors to make sure mrs nelson was shut in and left by the back door outside she hardly could tell that the season had changed from summer to fall the air was still and humid hanging over the trees preventing the green leaves from changing to red and yellow the sleeveless blouse she wore felt surprisingly light after the heavy starched uniform she had worn all day as she walked across the green lawn and toward the tool shed that bordered the summer vegetable garden she could hear the quiet humming of the crickets libby saw that the door was open which was strange the nelsons had never locked the shed but kept the door closed to keep out the dogs she was on her way to shut the door when she saw him standing by the wooden building hal her lips silently formed the word still she was not certain and her feet kept moving toward the wooden shed hal she called softly her voice was inaudible she was almost upon him now and from the way he reached into his pocket for a match she could tell he had been watching her all along she wondered for a minute what she would say she had imagined him coming home but not at a crazy time like this yet she felt strangely sure of herself certain that she was in no danger of making a fool of herself by crying she kept walking toward him and even this far away she could see the high cheekbones that marked all of their children as belonging to him hello libby he said blocking the path in front of her and reaching for her she knew he was kissing her and she was standing still kissing him back but the whole moment seemed so unreal all the while he held her she was wondering how he thought he could just come back as if hed never left her before finally she pulled away and his arms dropped to his side she watched his hands slip into his pants pocket i didnt think you were never coming back she said still facing him and smelling the cheap aftershave lotion he always used since before he started shaving where you been she looked past him at the hedge on the side of the yard wondering why she should notice how he smelled after that last card i didnt have no way of knowing which way you were heading and here you are coming back like theres not no reason for me to say i dont want you back the words came out in a rush matching the tears that were falling on her cheeks hal stood quietly with the same solid unconcerned expression that always made her angry when she was upset his arm reached out to her but she pushed him away who do you think you are anyway she demanded swallowing the sobs who do you think you are going away for as long as you please she was shouting now and to her ears her voice seemed apart from the rest of her suddenly she was pummeling his shoulders with her fists and before she realized what she had done she felt the side of her cheek smarting from the pressure of his hand oh she whispered staring at him calm yourself down girl his voice was gruff you give me a chance to explain you hear he took hold of her hand as if to keep her from striking him ive been working girl i needed to get away you think id write you those cards if i wasnt planning on coming back she stared at him her eyes following the green diagonal pattern in his shirt on down to the cotton twill pants that were so new they still had a crease down the front i just had to get away for a while seems like those children were making me crazy always running around not ever being still now dont you go saying i dont love you or those kids he stopped talking and looked straight at her if i didnt i wouldnt be coming back here the least you could have done was to tell me where you were her voice began to falter wicker and hamlet dont even ask about you no more they aint seen you in so long they forgot about you she was talking so fast her words seemed to pile up on each other people in town were all the time asking when you were coming back and i didnt have anything to tell them hal stood quietly listening to her he didnt even say anything when she stopped to catch her breath i got me a job we were getting along without you suddenly she couldnt say anything else there wasnt any sense in lying lots of times she wished hal was at home to help her decide things about the children this morning like every other morning for the past month she had to drag wicker from under the kitchen table he was all the time crawling under something yelling his head off and she didnt know what to do about him howd you know where i was i asked around he answered one of the boys in the drugstore said he thought you worked full time out here she swallowed quickly thinking that he couldnt even let her be the first person to know he was home well i had to find you he said as if understanding her thoughts i stopped by the house but meetrie wouldnt talk to me and wouldnt let the others even get close took the candy i brought them though dont you ever get them anything sweet to eat reckon they knew who you were she waited for him to understand the meaning of her words what you doing buying candy anyway they cant wear candy on their feet hal ignored her i got them some other things outside they didnt seem to have too many toys to play with howd you get out here he looked too freshly pressed to have walked from town on the dusty road i got me a car he said pointing across a field parked it over there near the path he was grinning like he expected her to be pleased a car her voice was dull a car libby stood unbelieving they wouldnt have any use for it except to go to town weekends they didnt have money to be buying gas besides all their friends and even the church were right in their neighborhood its not a new one but its all paid for i got it to get me home i even made enough money to get brand new seat covers hal said proudly bet you thought we wouldnt never have a car she nodded her head dully heh honey remember before we were married we talked about getting one of those little fords you know with the two seats in front one like we were going to get to drive up north his voice sounded wistful and he waited to see if she remembered seeing no bit of recognition in her eyes he kept talking i could have gotten me one of those dirt cheap but at the last minute i sort of changed my mind she stood as if in a spell listening to his voice and wondering how he could be so excited over a car he didnt even act like he had just slapped her come on he grabbed her hand lets go look i got it painted blue just like you always wanted libby felt tears washing her eyes blue was her favorite color yet she couldnt for the life of her understand him here they were needing to get the house fixed up so the chimney didnt smoke when the cold came she still hadnt paid the doctor his money from the last time calvin was in the hospital and he decided to bring home a car she turned toward him now that youre here you going to sell it he looked in the direction where the car was parked and again at her no he said not meeting her eyes im going to keep it bet meetrie would like riding in a car and the little fellows too suddenly he smiled its got brand new pipes the man up north put them on special for me libby you should hear this baby when i take off he kept on talking about the car forcing her to listen she couldnt even understand why he was so excited about exhaust pipes where they lived there werent that many other people who could listen out for hals car she remained quiet as he finished smoking and dropped the cigarette butt on the ground crushing the tiny red light with the heel of his shoe he still held her by the hand almost pulling her along as they began walking across the field what you going to do for a job she asked hurrying to keep up with him she always forgot how tall he was until she had to try and walk beside him he had a certain rhythm to his walk and she listened to their footsteps hitting the brittle grass still too fast for you he smiled down at her matching his long strides with her fast short steps oh ill get my old job back he said his brown eyes were smiling webberll be glad to get me back after fooling with those slow niggers libby knew he was right every time she went to the drugstore mr webber made a special point of asking when she was expecting hal home hal was talking but not particularly to her havent seen this old town in so long just about forgotten what everything looks like his eyes came to rest on the brown bag she still clutched in her hand whats that leftovers for the children she answered i dont like for them to go to bed without anything in their stomachs mrs nelson give it to you no i guess she knows i take whats left wherere you planning to get money to buy gas the esso man wont give you no credit unless you been working steady around here he ignored her his voice insistent she know you took this food mrs nelson never gives away anything unless its spoiled he did not say another word until they reached the car and she was too tired to talk her whole body felt drained she only wanted to see the car up close touch it and see it at the same time to end the moment she was dreading and hope she didnt start crying as she stood looking at the old ford she felt her tongue almost stick to her throat she walked to the front of the car and the headlights seemed to make a face at her in the dusky twilight she could see the fresh paint and the chromium parts were shining even seeing it parked there just a few steps away she still could not believe he had brought home a car when they needed everything else then hal was standing quietly beside her his arms around her shoulder pressing her close to him get in he said opening the door he pressed the button to lock her in and strode around to the drivers side she watched while he pushed in the key seeing past the dusty tint of the front windows past the flat countryside she looked out at the windowdarkened cotton fields and at the scrawny trees in the distance the trees were stuck to the edge of the fields as if the men who cleared the ground had been too lazy to finish their work she looked at the road she had walked this morning seeing how it seemed to blend into the sameness of the surrounding land the starting motor interrupted her thoughts and then hal was talking i said did you want to stop by your mamas before we go home she did not answer he seemed to have a knack for making her do things she never planned on doing but if she wanted him she had to want the car there wasnt any sense in even thinking about fixing up the house now all their extra money would go for gas but at least he had come back to her and somehow nothing else was very important she settled back into the seat her eyes drawn to the profile of his headthe hair closely cut his eyes so intent on the road that if she had not known better she would have expected traffic miraculously to appear no she said putting the paper bag on the seat between them the children are going to want you to play with them before they go to bed we might as well pick up the baby and go home by julia fields r damon millers wife passed his chair twice she was making trips from the aic table to the refrigerator in order to set the table for a little party for the two of them they had been talking of the event which gave rise to this party she had done the more talking while mr miller had done the more thinking the more remembering yesterday he had bought for her the huge bouquet of carnations now on the table in front of him he also had bought a set of french paring knives and a little gold locket he was remembering the look she gave him when he had given her those gifts she had grown into the opposite of what she might have or even should have her hands when she placed the candle holder on the table were two stubby cups of flesh masses of flesh it seemed matched only by the ringlets which comprised her neck her two gray eyes settled into her hugeness of body until she looked very much like a great carnivorous monster when she came near his chair he diminished in size he felt that if she said again happy anniversary he would simply disappear behind the impact of her strong clear voice he hoped she would not say this he couldnt bear to hear her say another word he grew ashamed for these thoughts but they became more intense on her third trip she brought two small vegetable salads going around his chair clumsily on her overburdened feet he did not move she would certainly say but dear you promised to sit with me dont leave please really dont you promised like a childs record her voice would catch his ears and the fat hands would clutch his own damon dear he made himself sit deathly still he looked at his watch it was ten of seven now she sat heavily upon a chair she had shredded a carrot and had begun to eat it in a testy manner in the same way he had watched her as she tasted a bit of each of the courses for the party during the early years of their marriage he had urged her to eat for she had been a finicky and fussy nibbler then he delighted in putting his hands around her waist and lifting her into the sky although he was himself of almost the same height and weight as she now she made two of him he could hear her saying something punctuated with the word dear but it seemed to him that she had no right to be endearing herself to him that this strange fat creature with whom he had been sitting for two hours should make no reference at all to him for years he had sat at this table at seven oclock eating his dinner with her across from him for years he had told her about his job as fireman on the train she had listened and made comments she had smiled and perhaps he had been humorous and they had planned something or they had regretted having no family no children the candles glow caught the sparkle in her eyes she was looking from the candles to the cake on which was the lovely candied decoration he stood kissed her cheeks he smiled at her but she didnt seem to notice amazed he sat and looked at her it occurred to him that she had ceased to actually see hear or feel his presence then she glanced at him he became numb well dear she said arent you after all its our he knew what she would say he knew the whole drama the set piece and the dialogue just a second he got up from the table he could hear her chuckling to herself as he walked down the hallway in their bedroom he took his payroll check from the cash envelope and endorsed it it was what he always did on fridays she could cash it tomorrow she always did on saturdays he put the extra cash into his pocket and into a valise he put clean socks handkerchiefs and shirts he must hurry get out out if he heard her voice just once more he could waste time around the station until the train left at eightthirty they would not be unduly curious afterward he could begin to become anonymous as he glided past the door he could hear the tinkle of silver she was eating he laughed aloud to himself but he was careful not to allow the door to slam he glanced at his watch and shook it furiously for it still stood at ten of seven and then he began to run very fast for a man of his age very very fast noblesse oblige by eloise greenfield knew it was tuesday before the m dream was finished by the time she vjtiic opened her eyes she had progressed through the various phases of anticipation from vague contentedness to the realization that this was the day of her weekly visit to the childrens home in the city james would be sitting in his chair by the window waiting for her she stretched and tinges of pink bespattered her skin as she thought of james a blanket of wellbeing enclosed her in its warmth most of the children at the home were slightly reserved but he was extremely so and few emotions stirred the surface of his dark face though his reticence formed a barrier between them marian was confident that with patience she would be able to free his natural ebullience it was a pity she thought that so many people lived without giving of themselves to others and missed the gratification that came with witnessing the transformation of a face by gratitude they leave their religion at the church door she often told fred getting up marian slid her feet into the mules beside the bed and put on the yellow flowered robe she thought with pleasure of her other tuesday appointment passing the bathroom she went down to the kitchen where danny had left the milk on the table and the absence of dirty pans told her that breakfast had again consisted of a sandwich ill have to speak to him about that she thought breaking an egg into the small frying pan she felt a twinge of guilt about not cooking breakfast for danny and fred but her plans to relinquish some of her exhausting charity positions had to wait until there was someone to replace her intuition told her that it was probably for the best since a twelve year old should be taught a sense of responsibility and fred ate at a cafe near the office she assumed the traditional position of reverence and asked a blessing before beginning to eat marians model had been her father in moments of discouragement and weariness she conjured up the vision of john hinton a tax lawyer not very high on the social ladder but towering and stately in his humility and concern for others remember daughter hed said frequently in his chantlike bass noblesse oblige we the noble must honor our obligations the hobo who had come to their door when marian was ten or eleven was a permanent and often used fixture in her memory he had been almost chinless and his face was a puffy chocolate with black borders of hair on each side the family had been about to start dinner when her father answered the knock at the back door mr hinton had stridden back to the dining room removed his dinner from the table plate and fork included and given them to the hobo through the window marian had watched as the man thanked him with several slight nods of his head and sat on the steps to eat there had been a fleeting enigmatic flame in his eyes that frightened her so that she had looked at her father for reassurance mr hintons chin was thrust forward at an angle that was familiar to marian and made her secure once more his eyes glowed and a thwarted smile hovered at the comers of his mouth he had never seemed taller than when he reentered the house filled another plate and joined the family at the table when they had finished dinner the hobo the plate and the fork had disappeared well thats the way they are mr hinton had lamented all we can do is keep trying upstairs again marian found that she had lingered too long over breakfast to take a bath sponging herself quickly she lotioned and dabbed cologne in strategic spots she dressed carefully in matching blue lingerie and the dark blue sheath dress that accentuated her height and combed her brown hair into the soft style that fred liked marian always tried to please fred because she didnt love him she thought of him as her captor a kind unwitting captor but one who had frustrated her plans for a life of service to the unfortunate as an adolescent she had visualized herself in the sparkling white of a nurse or as a dedicated social worker bringing comfort into the hovels of the poor to have married because of a pregnancy that turned out to be a false alarm was the irony of her life she bitterly regretted the naivete of little marian just out of high school who had chosen marriage over the other alternative marian went into dannys room and hurriedly scrawled a note on his bulletin board sandwiches for breakfast ill be home about leftovers in refrig got home too late to see you last night so love love love glancing at her watch she saw that she would have to rush in order to keep both appointments the second was as important to her as the visit with james if not more so she snatched one of dannys old books from the shelf and dropped it into her purse before she left as marian drove she practiced the nursery tune she would teach james today if she had enough time the sun glinted on the car hood making in conjunction with passing shadows varicolored figures that danced to her music she had almost driven past lauras when she remembered that her friend had asked for a ride into the city thanks for the lift laura said sliding into the car i have some shopping to do at taylors for the kids how are harry and the kids marian asked pulling out again into the traffic just fine harrys staying at the apartment in the city tonight weekly meeting marian wished silently that laura would occasionally think of someone other than harry and the kids that she would show some concern for children like james who were the result of immorality and neglect she ached at the injustice that allowed these children to suffer because their parents wanted nothing more than to live like animals gratifying every whim without thought of consequences she saw her duty clearlyto teach cleanliness and morals to those less fortunate no matter how difficult it was after dropping laura off at taylors marian continued the drive to the childrens home she found james in the recreation room not playing with the other children but as always sucking his thumb and staring out the window hello there she said cheerfully extricating his thumb yourefive now james much too big for that james bottom lip gave a weak tremor but she pretended not to notice she tucked his shirttail into the faded green boxer shorts between the shorts and socks that had long since lost their elasticity thin ashen legs projected marian made a mental note to bring lotion the following week she stroked his head briskly with the brush shed bought for him and wiped his shoes with a piece of tissue she first dampened with her tongue thats better she told him now if youll just smile youll be almost as handsome as my little boy james extended his lips sidewards in a straight line taking from her purse the book shed brought marian sat beside him and read with enthusiasm speaking distinctly and changing her voice for all the different characters james sat quietly showing no reaction once when his thumb started slowly toward his mouth she stopped it without looking up and without anger deceit she realized was another enemy for her to fight she understood that it wasnt his fault the halfhour was over before marian finished the story but she couldnt remain longer or she would be late for her other appointment she left the book with james after coaxing him to smile and say thank you traffic was surprisingly light on crawford st and marian was relieved she was hardly in a mood to fight each inch of the way this had been her fourth visit with james and still there was not a sign of improvement she wondered whether any good could come of a sacrifice that evidently wasnt appreciated she was sure that even her father if he were alive would agree that james was beyond help next week she decided she would request another child pulling into the department store parking lot she maneuvered into the one space left on the first ramp walked through the store and left by the main entrance she walked four blocks east just as she reached the white stone apartment building on the corner of fourth and jefferson an envelope dropped from the pocket of a boy who passed her young man she called picking up the envelope she smiled brightly to show her friendliness as she handed it to him although the boy was obviously not yet out of his teens his composed brown face and his poise as he thanked her revealed a peculiar maturity he bowed low a grateful smile creasing his face but his eyes were the eyes of the hobo from her childhood and her fright was a relapse into the past the boy turned and left but this time marian had read the eyes correctly she was positive she would never understand them she had tried to help him and he had responded with hatred oh well she thought with a brave toss of her head noblesse oblige she forgot the boy as she turned into the building and with a surge of emotion rode the elevator to harrys apartment memo to a nation by ronald williams nfortunately it u appears that little has been learned from the race riots of the summer of the usual observations and comments have been made racial discrimination unemployment poor housing ignorance police brutality and poverty have all been cited as causes all of these deplorable conditions have created abject despair in the black ghettos as far as this reasoning goes it manifests a partial truth and isolates obvious symptoms what is most lamentable is that no one commenting on the plight of the northern negro has bothered to carry his diagnosis to its logical conclusion the rioters vented a despair with our democratic process as they have come to know it for them it is a way of life that has frustrated and aborted their dreams of a better life it would be facetious to think of their despair as being general and aimless the los angeles rioters words and targets for destruction were all too pointed if not confused and ill directed further a people suffering from diffused hopelessness seldom riot riots are born of hope how meaningless to the rioters are all the federal laws attempting to enfranchise the southern negro in the north and west the negro has enjoyed the right to vote to patronize most restaurants air terminals and hotels recently these have not been the goals of the northern negro he has voted and moreover he has elected negro politicians to office in the past and even the present the white northern politicians have used whatever means suitable to placate their ethnically diverse electorate they have been all things to all people when among the italians they have been lovers of spaghetti and the glory of rome at the same time they have attempted to calm these white citizens about the negroes encroaching on their neighborhoods when among the slavic people the irish and the polish the same approach has been used these politicians have failed to give leadership to either the white or negro electorate when addressing their white voters they have appealed to their fears and prejudices and at the same time have venerated if not sanctified the status quo regarding housing and the schools when among negroes these same politicians have mouthed platitudes vacuous promises and humiliating pleas for patience for practical purposes and political expediency few have appealed to their citizens sense of justice democratic idealism and a dream of a better life for all this lack of political imagination and faith in our democratic system has invaded and permeated all phases of citygovernment the slums and corruption in most northern cities are the end products of governing cynics who would rather serve consecutive years in office with a hope for a higher position in government than lead courageously confronted with explosive antagonisms hatreds and fears in their cities many of these men are still searching for the expedient way as though what confronts them will go away freeing them to return to their jobs of misgoverning in addition the white northern politicians have given patronage and favors to a few negroes usually precinct and ward bosses it is the same pattern used all over the world whether on the plantations in the colonies among the peasants of europe or wherever in order to keep the masses in line a few men are selected for this purpose and given the trappings of prestige and power plus a few favors and it works until the people are awakened during the last twentyfive years most urban centers have been governed by men of mediocre talents men who have lacked vision men who have placed personal ambition above the duties of office and men who have been too susceptible to influences of all kinds most large cities have monuments dedicated to these mens disservice if not criminal conduct the sprawling slums vice ridden streets overcrowded schools and other decaying conditions are their legacy to the future these pitiable politicians had plenty of assistance the realestate blocks fought to keep taxes down they fought to preserve the black ghetto by opposing fair housing the industrialist and business man wanted peace and low taxes the pressure groups among the white power structure wanted social and economic conditions to improve without changing the comfortable and profitable structure although the negro in watts harlem hough and other ghettos sees his enemy as white his enemy wears all the colors of men he is fighting corruption and penuriously ambitious men who desire wealth and position and assume few social or democratic responsibilities in the black ghetto there is a constant cry of police brutality in one northern city there are at least seven negro councilmen serving the city these negro councilmen have made few if any attempts to investigate these allegations of police brutality to meet with the citizenry and police representatives to promote understanding and reciprocal responsibility while doing nothing officially to eliminate police brutality or to exonerate the police force the negro politicians decry police brutality in their wards the police departments are placed in the precarious and untenable position of attempting to preserve law and order where respect for law and order no longer exists in watts the police were referred to as the occupying force to the negro in the slums the police are protecting the mans system which is by definition the enemy what the negro has not learned is that the man is not always white the police also have their burden to bear they cannot demand respect from a citizenry that pays them off to operate numbers rackets speakeasies and to pander the dialectics of this kind of situation are unavoidable contemptuous disdain for police and law results only a fool would expect other consequences and further it should be apparent to all that the police enforce the law only with the consent of the vast majority of a population without this consent occupation best describes their function it would be foolhardy and an invitation to all kinds of extremists to encourage more stringent law enforcement without attempting to solve the basic source of hatred for law and order and as long as the people of the black ghetto believe that the police represent a white monolithic power whose only aim is to contain suppress exploit and brutalize them the basic attitudes and problems have not been touched again we see one more symptom of despair with a democratic system which has shown its weaknesses and contempt for a people forcing them to embrace a value system and attitudes which are antithetical to the highest ideals of democracy if the negro of the ghetto were to embrace the expressed values of white society it would be tantamount to selfnegation and insanity one would think that the negroes in the black ghetto would be able to discuss their grievances with school administrators and reach settlements acceptable to both groups for years the schools have cried for parental interest and involvement with the educational process their pronounced goal has been the whole child when a levy was needed community schools has been the pass word street clubs community councils and civil_rights groups have found boards of education and school administrators unreceptive and resentful of their concerns and complaints perhaps what is most frightening about all of these people responsible for public education is the impression they convey that they and only they are qualified to have opinions about the education of children parents who resent halfday sessions for their children who complain of overcrowded classrooms who challenge a curriculum that frustrates and retards their children and who want a modern technical training program for their high schools are treated as subversives these parents are called trouble makers usually aroused by a hard core of trouble makers yet the problems persist educators and boards of education spend more time and energy attacking their critics and address too little effort to eliminating the problems which cause the criticism there are many whites in the urban centers who judge a school excellent if it is all white as one teacher in a large northern city stated all children regardless of social status race or religion receive the same education in this townan inferior one theres no prejudice here it is not accidental that a small number of merit scholarships if any are awarded to children from the urban center last year in one large city the only student awarded a merit scholarship was a negro girl whites also have every reason to be alarmed about their educational system unfortunately the white middle class has fled to the suburbs leaving the lower class whites who as yet have not thoroughly examined their educational system whites within the central city have become staunch defenders of the neighborhood school concept it has become more than a concept it is discussed as though it were an inviolate right frankly i fail to see the advantage of a white child sitting next to a negro child and both receiving the same miseducation in the same overcrowded classroom and if sitting next to a white child will prevent sociopsychological mutilation then there are thousands of negroes in cleveland chicago los angeles and other large cities who have escaped this malady during the thirties and forties many of these negroes sat next to white children it is questionable whether this limited school contact changed either the negro or white child that much certainly during high school white and negro contacts were confined to school affairs and nonschool social contacts were limited if at all many civil_rights leaders psychologists and sociologists are of the opinion that if a school is integrated that the negro child will receive a better education because the schools have higher standards for whites this is a partial truth if the white children are from poor families and if their parents are not vocal and do not insist on equality education they will receive the same education as the negro child most of the white parents who are concerned about their childrens education have moved to the suburbs or enrolled their children in private schools the majority of whites remaining in the central city are in the same boat as the negro the only difference is they just are not aware of their plight yet or the dire consequences of miseducation their children must bear in the future the public school problem in the black ghetto reveals another area where those who persist in attempting to use all legal and democratic procedures to effect change have been forced into the streets and demonstrations those negroes attempting to use normal channels such as through meetings discussions with school authorities and community leaders to effect changes in their schools have usually met frustration patronizing indulgence and the contumely of the school administrators and boards of education where words have failed sitins and demonstrations have succeeded in some instances consequently those who have opposed and closed the door on discussion have taught the negro that demonstrations picketing and sitins are their most effective bargaining tools admittedly this is a pathetic commentary on the nation that is attempting to instruct the world in democratic procedure in the north the black ghetto has been without leadership in the past the naacp has attracted the support of the negro middle class recently core chapters have been established in the ghetto but have not as yet captured the imagination and following of the people for the most part negro ministers have concerned themselves with the hereafter today these ministers are treated with derision and contempt too many of these men of the cloth have pointed their congregations heart toward the heavens while they have cruised the ghetto in cadillacs expensive clothing and lived in garish homes to fill this leadership vacuum many groups have arisen in the ghetto boards of education city administrators and politicians have called these groups extremist this produces a perplexing paradox during the initial stage of civil discontent with the schools police housing inspectors community councils and other less militant groups were brushed aside rendering them ineffectual in the eyes of the ghetto now that more militant organizations have arisen and are unwilling to be pushed aside these groups are called radical and irresponsible there is one lesson that all negro and whites had better learn today no one will lead in the ghetto unless he voices in unequivocable words the discontents of the ghetto the respected negro professional business man or politician does not lead in the ghetto their absence during the riots in los angeles was by design and not by accident the negro middle class fled the black ghetto for the same reasons the white middle class abandoned the central city these black professionals clerks and small business men have contributed little leadership financial investment or spiritual encouragement to their less fortunate brothers they have concerned themselves with homes in the suburbs cars swimming pools cotillions and all the frills and leisurely decadence of their class tragically this middle class is an imitation of the white middle class it has all the pretensions and decadence but for the most part have no capital working for them most of these middle class negroes are running scared to maintain their recently acquired standard of living and all important appearance the negro middle class does not have a history of frugality civic responsibility and financial investment in our economy the black suburbanite was born in imitation and decadence its creative period belongs to the future for the most part they would rather have the negroes in the ghetto become more moderate after all things are much better today for the negro obviously there is no easy answer to the problems of the black ghetto the answers that will emerge and are tried will deeply change our entire american way of life of this most people are assured the primary need in the ghetto is to rekindle faith in our democratic procedure i do not minimize the need for jobs training education and food but if the lower class negro is to enter our society as a productive and creative person he must have faith in the dem ocratic system he also must make a contribution toward his habilitation not only a contribution but assume leadership and give direction to his own destiny there are those who for a number of reasons do not want the poor represented in the policy making level in these habilitative programs if the people of watts harlem and hough cannot produce their own responsible leadership and assist in their own economical and educational habilitation we had better withdraw from viet nam and all the other backward nations of the world surely if we cannot effect self determination in our own country we must fail abroad where disparate cultures languages and histories compound our problems regardless of how many demonstrations riots and sitins follow eventually someone must sit down and discuss the issues if local groups neighborhood clubs and community councils were to take an active part in planning and executing these programs it would give them the dignity and the responsibility for their own futures that charity and patronage have eroded naturally there are going to be problems there are class and racial antagonisms to be dealt with professionals are going to think that they are in a better position to understand diagnose and plan perhaps so if so they should be able to persuade by revealing information and reasoning these professionals have a responsibility to educate these negro leaders these professionals also have a responsibility to learn often what separates them from the untutored negro leaders is vocabulary hardly meriting the weight usually given it dialogues must be established with boards of education police departments and other agencies problems must be discussed openly and honestly above all positive results must emerge on both sides if not there are always those waiting to denounce these procedures and take to the ctreets the people will take to the streets rightly so if we fail to provide them with an effective means of settling their grievances opening discussions and meetings on the street level appear to be the only solution today there is no organization which can command a sizeable following and control over the ghetto for that the authorities should be thankful but unless action is taken to enlist the participation of the black ghetto to improve conditions and establish confidence in democratic procedures we had better be prepared to face the consequences of this inaction if that sad day should come we will have forsaken the dream that we now offer the world and without this hope and this dream does america have anything to offer that is not now in abundance up from paternalism by the rev c eugene askew he p ost civil war era that could with some justification be identi fied by the title of booker t washingtons autobiography up from slavery has at long last given way to a time of increasing civil_rights for minority groups there are abundant indications that in the near future assured civil_rights for every american citizen will be a reality now there lies ahead an era which can perhaps be characterized as up from paternalism an age much more subtle since it is in the realm of intangible attitudes civil_rights can be gained through political power respect other than for power alone cannot on the whole nonviolent negro demonstrations boycotts sitins and the like have gained not only civil_rights but also a growing respect for negroes from the white community moreover with rapidly expanding cultural educational and employment opportunities for negroes the gap inevitably will be narrowed between the negro and white worlds with both an increased sense of dignity within negroes and a belated recognition of the negros capabilities by the hitherto considerably more privileged white citizens it also is inevitable that attitudes will change as negro and white people work play and study together on a free and equal basis while i am willing to sacrifice my convenience for genuine integration i must confess that i am enjoying this interim period while the white people in houston get used to integration of our public facilities my wife and i sit in the unreserved section to watch the houston astros home baseball games we have found both to our regret for the still prevailing racial prejudice and to our secret delight at our personal good fortune that even at wellattended games we can arrive at game time and still find excellent seats on the first or second row next to negroes we shall either have to go earlier or miss our choice seats when this particular kind of prejudice disappears the same situation is found at motion picture theatres but to a lesser degree perhaps when some white people get used to the dark and realize that they are sitting next to negroes they do not want to make a fetish of moving if so this in itself is an improvement over past attitudes or it may be that white people feel that in a darkened theatre other white people will not know they are sitting next to negroes having been reared in georgia i know that most southern people do not feel any strangeness or repugnance in associating intimately with negro people so long as either no other white person is watching or the association is on an obviously paternalistic level or perhaps racial prejudice is simply less strong among the moviegoing public than among baseball fans racial attitudes are certainly changing rapidly in america so much so that within a few generations no one will speak of the future of the american negro for the simple reason that there will be no such thing as an american negro miscegenation legal and illegal and past present and future will take care of color lines although not of class and economic prejudices it is only a matter of time until underprivileged segregationists and lower class negroes join forces for their mutual interests in the meanwhile however all american people have to live together in a present which is shaping the future sometimes i get impatient with endless and aimless liberal talk that is often irresponsible and appears to do as much harm as good this talk nevertheless does indicate a degree of interest and concern out of such talk there will eventually evolve attitudes and actions which will permanently alter our american society it has been my observation through years as a minister in particular and an observer of the american scene in general that church people are very much like the rest of the populace in the churches i have served as in the political arena it is always the liberals who dream the dreams and force the conservatives out of their complacency but when the dreams have to be translated into reality the liberals seldom have the stability and knowhow to get the job done i have learned from experience that almost always it is the dissatisfied or even neurotic element which stirs things up and then depends on the conservative and usually more stable group to sift the good ideas from the bad and make them work without the liberals the status quo almost always gets more and more smug and lifeless but without the conservatives worthwhile dreams often turn into nightmares of inefficiency and rebellion serving merely as a vent for frustration since church people on the whole are politically and socially at least as conservative as the general population the present church support of the civil_rights movement indicates that the battle for civil_rights for negroes has been won only the translation of this new mood into effective political and social action remains to be fully implemented now a new and much more complicated battle has to be fought to eliminate or to reduce paternalism there are few white americans who are not guilty of paternalistic attitudes toward negroes even if these attitudes are not selfrecognizable or apparent to casual observers i have long prided myself on having liberal racial attitudes articles i have written speeches i have made sermons i have preached and actions i have taken in behalf of negro people have at times brought distress to my family but it is only during the past few months that i have begun to see within myself racial prejudices which i thought had disappeared years ago perhaps a better title for this present article might well be confessions of a white paternalist i remember vividly back in the middle s when as a teenager i was the only pupil in a large church school class to vote in favor of a proposed interracial meeting to be held at our church but standing up for the dignity and rights of others does not necessarily guarantee that one does not carry within himself subtle paternalistic attitudes which are all tooapparent to sensitive negro people subtle racial paternalism is a necessary phase in social change which america must now endure as it earlier endured slavery near slavery and open paternalism but the phase can be considerably shortened and less damaging if white americans will take a good look at themselves in the attempt to ferret out both their conscious and subconscious paternalistic attitudes i see no logical reason why white americans consciously seeking better racial attitudes should feel guilty because our fathers have eaten sour grapes and have set our teeth on edge we are not responsible for the sins of our fathers although we may be responsible for the prejudices of our children one simply cannot be brought up in a society where a minority group has consistently been exploited ridiculed and degraded without coming to feel emotionally if not rationally that such people have to be treated differently from other peoplethe worst of us employing harshness and force and the best of us thinking of negroes as somewhat like children even if our actions to them are kind and just much of white criticism for some present negro actions and i include myself among these white critics may well include the attitude of a father to a rebellious teenager whom the father knows has to rebel in order to grow nevertheless the father also resents his loss of control over the son in time a rebellious son grows up and has a mature meaningful relationship to the father if the latter has been loving wise and emotionally mature enough himself to let his son be his own man even while giving the support every boy needs from his father the above analogy is very common indeed among white people the racial attitude of the late dr albert schweitzer furnishing a conspicuous examplebut the analogy is not justified because negro adults are not children and they rightly resent being treated as such even if one excludes such ridiculous fantasies as an ignorant white backwoodsman thinking that he is a better man than a ralph bunche although the chances are that the former has never even heard of the latter there is still within most white people an emotional feeling that negroes are not really equal to white peoplea feeling inevitably imposed by past american political social cultural educational and economic conditions negro people to some degree have accepted subconsciously if not consciously the white mans judgment concerning their alleged inferiority even among negroes a lighter skin has been generally judged to be superior white values have been prized and sought paternalism reveals itself in many ways for example only in recent years have i learned not to speak with individual negroes concerning race if they themselves initiate such discussion i of course participate openly but otherwise i do not even at the risk of some negro and white people assuming especially since i am a native southerner that i am racially prejudiced in the long run such simple acceptance of people as they are without mention of race will do more to eliminate paternalism than unlimited and embarrassing protestations of racial brotherhood by white people to negroes i have often sung for civic and church groups the most popular selection and the one i did best was a version of shortnin bread complete with a negro dialect borrowed from versions by lawrence tibbitt and lansing hatfield with additions of my own another favorite was water boy a song made vivid to me by my boyhood recollections of watching negro convicts work and sing but both songs present certain negro stereotypes in an affectionate but nevertheless paternalistic way to be sure i never sang either of these songs without following with op man river some years ago however my conscience began to bother me about singing these songs as i became more sensitive to negro feelings with great reluctance i decided never to sing these songs again until such time as these stereotypes no longer exist or negro and white people can accept these songs as folk music and folklore without traumaan evolvement not likely to take place in this generation paternalism exists in many forms both recognized and unrecognized within almost all american white people all of these forms must diligently be searched for and eliminated from the lives of all white men if the era of subtle paternalism is to be transcended as the last great barrier separating human beings and degrading all whom it touches west indian partisans in the fight for by john henrik clarke est indians have been coming to the united states for over a century the part they have played in the progress of the afroamericans in their long march from slavery to freedom has always been an important factor more important is the fact that the most outstanding of these caribbeanamericans saw their plight and the plight of the afroamerican as being one and the same as early as a jamaican john b russwurm one of the founders of liberia was the first colored man to be graduated from an american college and to publish a newspaper in this country sixteen years later his fellow countryman peter ogden organized in new york city the first oddfellows lodge for negroes prior to the civil war west indian contribution to the progress of the afroamerican life was one of the main contributing factors in the fight for freedom and full citizenship in the northern part of the united states in his book souls of black folk dr w e b du bois says that the west indians were mainly responsible for the manhood program presented by the race in the early decades of the last century indicative of their tendency to blaze new paths is the achievement of john w a shaw of antigua who in the early s of the last century passed the civil service tests and became deputy commissioner of taxes for the county of queens in new york state in th century america two of the most outstanding fighters for liberty and justice were the west indiansprince hall and john b russwurm when prince hall came to the united states the nation was in turmoil the colonies were ablaze with indignation britain with a series of revenue acts had stoked the fires of colonial discontent in virginia patrick henry was speaking of liberty or death the cry no taxation without representation played on the nerve strings of the nation prince hall then a delicatelooking teenager often walked through the turbulent streets of boston an observer unobserved a few months before these hectic scenes he had arrived in the united states from his home in barbados where he had been born about the son of an englishman and a free african woman he was in theory a free man but he knew that neither in boston nor in barbados were persons of african descent free in fact at once he questioned the sincerity of the vocal white patriots of boston it never seemed to have occurred to them that the announced principles motivating their action was stronger argument in favor of destroying the system of slavery the colonists held in servitude more than a half million human beings some of them white yet they engaged in the contradiction of going to war to support the theory that all men were created equal when prince hall arrived in boston that city was the center of the american slave trade most of the major leaders of revolutionary movement in fact were slaveholders or investors in slavesupported businesses hall like many other americans wondered what did these men mean by freedom the condition of the free black men as prince hall found them was not an enviable one emancipation brought neither freedom nor relief from the stigma of color they were free in name only they were still included with slaves indentured servants and indians in the slave codes discriminatory laws severely circumscribed their freedom of movement by prince hall saw little change in the condition of the blacks and though a freeman at least in theory he saw his people debased as though they were slaves still in bondage these things drove him to prepare himself for leader ship among his people so through diligence and frugality he became a property owner thus establishing himself in the eyes of white people as well as the blacks but the ownership of property was not enough he still had to endure sneers and insults he decided then to prepare himself for a role of leadership among his people to this end he went to school at night and later became a methodist preacher his church became the forum for his peoples grievances ten years after his arrival in boston massachusetts he was the accepted leader of the black community in hall petitioned the massachusetts legislature protesting the kidnapping of free negroes this was a time when american patriots were engaged in a constitutional struggle for freedom they had proclaimed the inherent rights of all mankind to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hall dared to remind them that the black men in the united states were human beings and as such were entitled to freedom and respect for their human personality prejudice made hall the father of african secret societies in the united states he is the father of what is now known as negro mas onry hall first sought initiation into the white masonic lodge in boston but was turned down because of his color he then applied to the army lodge of an irish regiment his petition was favorably received on march hall and fourteen other black americans were initiated in lodge number when on march the british were forced to evacuate boston the army lodge gave prince hall and his colleagues a license to meet and function as a lodge thus on july african lodge no came into being this was the first lodge in masonry established in america for men of african descent the founding of the african lodge was one of prince halls greatest achievements it afforded the africans in the new england area of the united states a greater sense of security and contributed to a new spirit of unity among them halls interest did not end with the lodge he was deeply concerned with improving the lot of his people in other ways he sought to have schools established for the children of the free africans in massachusetts of prime importance is the fact that prince hall worked to secure respect for the personality of his people and also played a significant role in the downfall of the massachusetts slave trade he helped to prepare the groundwork for the freedom fighters of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose continuing efforts have brought the black american closer to the goal of full citizenship in his series of articles entitled pioneers in protest lerone bennett senior editor of ebony magazine has written a capsule biography of john b russworm the distinguished west indian who was a pioneer in afroamerican journalism the following information has been extracted from his article founders of the negro press ebony magazine july day in and day out the negroes of new york city were mercilessly lampooned in the white press in the dying days of the campaign of vilification and slander reached nauseous heights the integrity and courage of negro men were openly questioned worse editors invaded negro homes and impugned the chastity of negro women this was a time of acute crisis for all negro americans and the new york leaders were agonizingly conscious of the forces arrayed against them more ominous was the creeping power of the american colonization society which wanted to send free negroes back to africa john b russwurm and samuel e cornish two of the youngest and most promising of the new york leaders were assigned the task of inventing a journal that could speak forcibly to both the enemy and joint friend without and the brethren within the veil samuel e cornish who is virtually unknown today was born about in delaware and raised in relatively free environments of philadelphia and new york he organized the first negro presbyterian church in new york city russworm who is generally credited with being the first negrograduate of an american college was a jamaican the son of an englishman and an african woman his father neglected to inform his white wife of the sins of his youth but after his death the widow learned of his existence and financed his education at bowdoin college where he was graduated in russwurm and cornish made an excellent team despite the difference in their backgrounds in the prospectus for the proposed paper they idealistically stated we shall ever regard the constitution of the united states as our polar star pledged to no party we shall endeavor to urge our brethren to use their rights to the elective franchise as free citizens it shall never be our objective to court controversy though we must at all times consider ourselves as champions in defense of oppressed humanity daily slandered we think that there ought to be some channel of communication between us and the public through which a single voice may be heard in defense of five hundred thousand free people of color on friday march the first issue of freedoms journal the first negro newspaper in the western world appeared on the streets of new york city in their ambitious first editorial russwurm and cornish struck a high note of positiveness that still has something to say to the afroamericans in their present plight it read in part we wish to plead our own cause too long have others spoke for us too long has the republic been deceived by misrepresentations in things which concern us dearly though in the estimation of some mere trifles for though there are many in society who exercise toward us benevolent feelings still with sorrow we confess it there are others who make it their business to enlarge upon the least trifle which tends to discredit any person of color and pronounce anathema and denounce our whole body for the misconduct of this guilty one our vices and our degradation are ever arrayed against us but our virtues are passed unnoticed it is our earnest wish the first editorial of the first negro newspaper said to make our journal a medium of intercourse between our brethren in different states of this great confederacy the timeliness of this editorial written over a hundred years ago and the dynamics of its intellectual content is far ahead of most editorials that appear in presentday afroamerican newspapers during the later years of his life john b russwurm moved to a position that today would be called black nationalism after receiving his masters degree from bowdoin college in russwurm went to liberia in west africa where he established another newspaper the liberia herald and served as superintendent of schools after further distinguishing himself as the governor of the maryland colony of cape palmas this pioneer editor and freedom fighter died in liberia in the same year john b russwurm died another west indian edward w blyden went to africa and established himself in liberia he was destined to become the greatest black intellectual of the th century he concerned himself with the plight of african people the world over and eventually built a bridge of understanding between the people of african origin in the west indies the united states and in africa more than anyone else in the th and during the early part of the th century edward w blyden called upon the black man to reclaim himself and his ancient african glory the concept now being called negritude started with blyden blyden was born in the then danish west indian island of st thomas in but reacted against treatment of his people in the new world by emigrating to liberia in he was convinced that the only way to bring respect and dignity to the people of african descent was by building progressive new empires in africa whose civilization while remaining basically african would incorporate useful elements of western culture it was the great edward w blyden who with the immortal frederick douglass placed before the bar of public opinion in england and other countries in europe the case of the black man in america as far back as the renowned scholar and benefactor of west africa dr edward wilmot blyden speaking on the occasion of his inauguration as president of liberia college sounded the note for the organized teaching of the culture and civilization of africa and decried the fact that the worlds image of africa was not in keeping with africas true status in world history i quote from his address on this occasion the people generally are not yet prepared to understand their own interests in the great work to be done for themselves and their children we shall be obliged to work for some time to come not only without the popular sympathy we ought to have but with utterly inadequate resources in all englishspeaking countries the mind of the intelligent negro child revolts against the descriptions of the negro given in elementary books geographies travels histories having embraced or at least assented to these falsehoods about himself he concludes that his only hope of rising in the scale of respectable manhood is to strive for what is most unlike himself and most alien to his peculiar tastes and whatever his literary attainments or acquired ability he fancies that he must grind at the mill which is provided for him putting in material furnished to his hands bringing no contribution from his own field and of course nothing comes out but what is put in blyden made several trips to the united states and to his former home in the west indies with the gold coast nationalist j e casely hayford blyden developed the idea of a federation of west african states he died in of all the west indians who influenced the afroamerican freedom struggle the most colorful and the most controversial was marcus aurelius garvey among the numerous black manassehs who presented themselves and their grandiose programs to the people of harlem marcus garvey was singularly unique he was born in jamaica in the grandson of an african slavea fact that was his proudest boast he had grown up under a threeway color system white mulatto and black garveys reaction to color prejudice and his search for a way to rise above it and lead his people back to africa spiritually if not physically was the allconsuming passion of his existence marcus garveys glorious romantic and riotous movement exhorted the black race and fixed their eyes on the bright star of a future in which they would reclaim and rebuild their african homeland and heritage garvey came to the united states as a disciple of booker t washington founder of tuskegee institute unfortunately booker t washington died before marcus garvey reached this coun try garvey had planned to raise funds and return to jamaica to establish an institution similar to tuskegee in he had organized the universal negro improvement association in jamaica after the failure of this organization he looked to the united states where he found a loyal group of followers willing to listen to his message garvey succeeded in building a mass movement among american negroes while other leaders were attempting it and doubting that it could be done he advocated the return of africa to the africans and people of african descent he organized very rashly and incompetently the black star line a steamship company for transporting people of african descent from the united states to africa garvey and his movement had a short and spectacular life span in the united states his movement took really effective form in about and by he was in a federal prison charged with misusing the mails from prison he was deported home to jamaica this is briefly the essence of the garvey saga the selfproclaimed provisional president of africa never set foot on african soil he spoke no african language but garvey managed to convey to members of the black race everywhere and to the rest of the world his passionate belief that africa was the home of a civilization which had once been great and would be great again when one takes into consideration the slenderness of garveys resources and the vast material forces social conceptions and imperial interests which automatically sought to destroy him his achievement remains one of the great propaganda miracles of this country the deportation of marcus garvey and the decline of his movement marked the end of an era an era when west indians and afroamericans worked together and saw their plight as one and the same in spite of the contributions that west indians continued to make to the afroamerican freedom struggle the relations between these two basically african people deteriorated there are indications that the present freedom struggle in africa the caribbean area and in the united states will become the basis for a new era of understanding and cooperation foreign investments a boon to africa by a okonkwo nwani any writers on economic development have asserted that one of the causes for the low level of industrial output or absence of industrialism in african countries is the lack of capital and little or no investment domestically or internally to industrialize therefore foreign investments become very necessary and act as the agent or conveyor of progress this article is intended to dispel this timehonored notion and affirm that african countries should not depend upon foreign investment for industrialization since the investments from abroad have negative and destabilizing effects on the social stability of african countries foreign investments have their political economic and religious or ideological riders attached i will not be concerned with statistics in this paper to avoid unnecessary details but will only consider the question if african countries should industrialize without foreign investments from where will the funds for industrialization come to answer such a question a distinction should be made in the term economic surplus which is used for investment actual economic surplus is the difference between the societys actual current output and its actual current consumption it is identical with current saving or accumulation and finds its embodiment in assets of various kinds added to societys wealth during the period in question ie productive facilities and equipment inventories foreign balances and gold hoards actual economic surplus has been generated in all socioeconomic formations and while its size and structure have markedly differed from one phase of development to another its existence has characterized nearly all of mans history in africa this is equally true the magnitude of the actual economic surplus which is savings or capital formation is at least conceptually readily established and today is regularly estimated by statistical agencies in most countries the difficulties that are encountered in its measurement are merely technical which in the case of african countries is a case for organization lack of adequate statistical agencies is neither identical with nor synonymous with the lack of savings of a high magnitude another aspect that one has to consider is potential economic surplus ie the difference between the output that could be produced in a given natural technological environment with the help of employable productive resources and what might be regarded as essential consumption its realization presupposes a more or less drastic reorganization of the production and distribution of social output and implies farreaching changes in the structure of the society the potential economic surplus can be classified under four headings the societys excess consumption on the part of the upper income groups the output lost to society through the existence of unproductive workers the output lost due to irrational and wasteful organization of the existing productive apparatus the output foregone due to the existence of unemployment caused primarily by the anarchy of foreign production systems and ideology and the deficiency of effective demand correcting these shortcomings generated by the colonial system as they are in african countries the potential economic surplus would be undoubtedly realized as actual economic surplus which could be channelled into investment uses in most if not all african countries the shortage of capital does not exist as it seems to appear in most writings on industrially developing african countries the potential economic surplus that could be made available for such investment is large in all of them it is not large in absolute magnitudes as we deal with in highly industrialized countries such as the united states and great britain leaving the idea of the presence of sufficient internal capital for industrialization i will examine the types of foreign investments made in african countries a survey of the major private investments in africa shows that they were concentrated in the agricultural and extractive industries little or no investment was made in manufacture in all areas of africa where foreign investment has been made one fact stands out clearly the suppression of the inalienable rights of africans foreign investments foreign investments in africa have been praised as having been made with the primary reason of supplying the necessary capital for africas industrialization about per cent of such investments were concentrated in mining the principal areas are as follows mining south africa diamonds manganese gold and uranium libya petroleum zambia copper algeria petroleum congo republic copper cobalt diamonds and uranium angola copper cadmium zinc and diamonds ghana bauxite gold manganese nigeria tin petroleum gold sierra leone diamonds manganese southern rhodesia copper egypt uar phosphate iron ore liberia bauxite diamonds ethiopia petroleum s w africa copper diamonds uranium agriculture south africa wool liberia rubber ghana cocoa nigeria palm products rubber ethiopia coffee tanzannia sisal kenya coffee uganda coffee algeria citrus sudan cotton cameroon bananas mozambique tobacco southern rhodesia tobacco what are the social consequences of these foreign investments in these areas how do these investments as development schemes look to african eyes who benefits from them who pays for them what are the already apparent and probable future consequences of these schemes the answers to these questions will to some degree bring out the social impact of foreign investments in africa let us start with the mining interests in the preforeign investment period the peoples of africa owned their mines beneath the surface of their lands centuries before the advent of europeans in africa they mined such minerals as iron copper and tin they utilized these minerals in the local manufacture of their weapons for battle their agricultural implements their household wares and used bronze in works of art an outstanding example is the bronze work of benin which attracted the portuguese merchants to west africa the rich copper deposits of central africa now the property of belgian british and american corporations were originally owned and worked by africans in the present messina district of the northern transvaal south africa the bavenda carried on extensive shaftmining and smelting of copper ore in southwest africa copper ore was mined by the herero and was carried northward from tsumeb to ondangua to be smelted and worked by the ovambo coppersmiths today the tsumeb mines are owned by new york corporations and the herero and ovambo are brought to the mines to work as unskilled labourers the investments in mining by europeans and americans was the first step of conquest then followed the building of roads railroads capital importation and the promotion of european migration to the main areas of investment the final step in this process in the aftermath of world war ii has been aimed at carrying on the economic conquest in the form of foreign aid to complete systemize and accelerate the extraction of the continents resources the various governments added to the investments while the united states assumed the role of general overseer the investments made by foreign corporations and even governments were made for a definite goalprofits from and subjugation of the africans in africa ments in the whole of africa foreign investment was the principal cause for the concentration of european settlements in african countries there was the lure of diamonds and gold in south africa leading from there into rhodesia and southwest africa there were the attractions of the beautiful high plateau country in kenya and southern angola there were governmentsponsored settlement schemes for strategic or economic objectives to tackle the main questions asked earlier a few specific areas will be discussed now in almost all african countries the land was regarded as common property of the group the family clan tribe or nation land tenure is based on three cardinal principles that the land ultimately belongs to the community and cannot be alienated from it without its consent that within the community the individual shall have security of tenure for the land he requires for grazing his cattle his gardens his farms and that no member of the community shall be without land the land still remains the basis of life for the great majority of the people of africa including the most industrialized sections of the continent the old security of land tenure met its doom with the influx of foreign investment and european settlement in algeria south africa kenya rhodesia and mozambique it was the same story over and over again the original inhabitants were pushed back by the forces of foreign investment and by the newcomers who took the choicest areas for themselves and marked off what they did not require of what land was left for the exclusive habitation of the africans large areas were sequestered against future contingencies or out of sheer greedy speculation in kenya for example in europeans were in possession of acres of land of which only acres were under cultivation while some or more kikuyus were crowded into a reserve measuring acres the belgians in the congo and the french in equatorial and west africa usurped and allocated land for settlement or concession without regard to the legal rights of the original owners in south africa the story was much more gloomy in the interest of development with foreign investments people were driven off the land into restricted areas with the primary objective of forcing them to work outside the land available to them land alienation transformed selfsupporting farmers into squatter tenant farmers or migrant labourers on the settlers farms or drove them to the mines and cities in search of work furthermore where the land was taken or where it was not a tax was levied on every male african who appeared to have reached his sixteenth or eighteenth birthday settlers became liable for taxation when twentyone such taxation reinforced by automatic fines or imprisonment per cent of the tax or two months in jail in malawi nyasaland as an exampleserved effectively in increasing the labour supply to conclude the social evil of foreign investment in agriculture a comparison between the africancontrolled and settlercontrolled agriculturalsystem follows the wealth of west african colonies is largely due to the fact that they are cultivated by the people of the soil working in their own interests it is not an accident that colonies where the land remains in african hands pay their way where the land is given to settlers agriculture has to be subsidized in one way or another even in south africa the white farmer will not do a mans job and farming there survives by the crushing exploitation of the african and by differential taxation and special concessions on the railway which have to be paid by other users a careful examination of this will clearly show the problems of surplus raised earlier investment in mining in the bible we read god so loved the world that he gave his only son to redeem man on earth can we say that foreign investors so loved africans and the african quest for industrialization as to pour large sums of investible funds into the african continent directly i will say that was not the case profits by exploitation was the motivating force which pushed the bloated silkhatted couponclipping financiers to invest in africa a few remarks about mining in some african countries will be appropriate at this point european mining in south africa began about the total amount of recorded sales of diamonds and gold in the union of south africa through is billion this amount of monetary value was derived from tons of gold and over tons of diamonds the various minerals are itemized as follows value realized from minerals recorded sales through million gold diamonds coal asbestos copper uranium manganese chrome iron ore the amount calculated in the table was the value at the time they were sold if we were to use current prices it would come to over billion in zambia northern rhodesia the value of copper sold was billion in southern rhodesia the gold asbestos coal chrome and tungsten marketed brought a revenue of million between and and in million in the belgian congo now congo leopoldville the european mining of gold began in copper in diamonds and tin in later cobalt and manganese started to play a vital role in mineral exports if we neglect the value of undisclosed and substantial amounts of uranium and other fissionable materials exported the value comes to million annually between and the northeastern corner of angola has been aptly called a diamond country there the diamond company of angola has been called portugals most notable private enterprise in terms of its revenues perhaps yes but the social policies directed against the africans are atrociously criminal more than carats of diamonds were exported in alone this very company claims the distinction of having the lowest paid mine workers to be found anywhere in africa in over of its african employees were forced workers supplied by intervention of the authorities backed by the international bandits and conspirators these mine workers in angola were paid a month the net profits of the company for alone was and combined profits for and were per cent over the total of invested capital in the director of geological survey in ghana then gold coast reported that the value of the minerals extracted by the british from the colony since was million early in the th century the british dutch and danes were sending home gold to the value of annually today the ashanti goldfield corporation makes a profit of million from gold alone annually diamonds manganese and even agricultural produce are not accounted for in nigeria tons of tin ore worth million was exported between and in sierra leone between and more than million tons of diamonds from the marampa plain were exported in alone tons were exported an account of all these mining ventures has one factor in common mining rights were illegally acquired through deceit and conspiracy thus highly diabolical and iniquitous the investments from abroad were mainly in equipment royalties paid if any were very little the apparent lack of capital for current industrialization is due in a large measure to the drain of the mineral wealth of africa by foreign investment it is a serious charge to makethat the wealth of africa is drained away minerals are one of africas precious assets yet the mines are almost always operated by european capitalist companies which pay dividends to their overseas shareholders heavy remuneration to their directors as likely as not the lions share of their taxes to the british exchequer royalties to venerable but functionless companies and enormous wages to local european employees what remains for the african workers and for the african exchequers are the crumbs from the rich mans table so writes dr rita hinden in the challenge of african poverty anybody who could put himself in the position of the african will definitely come to the same answer as an african would without my spelling it out foreign investment in my own appraisal has been a handicap an impediment and a liability to the industrialization of africa investments in agriculture and mining have not led to manufacturing of any kind by the very corporations operating there in all areas whether occupied by settlers or not only the negative aspects of foreign investments dominated the scene justice freedom and individualism have been grossly subverted and destroyed how many lives have been lost in africa how many are still dying today anyone vitally interested should check the events in all of africathe whole of africa and the slave trade algeria and the french kenya the rhodesias and the british union of south africa cum united states of america visavis africans belgium and the congo in all these places we can talk eloquently about liberty and freedom and about human rights and fundamental freedoms and about dignity and worth of the human personality but most of our vocabulary derives from a period when our society was individualistic consequently it has little meaning to those who live under conditions where individualism means premature deaths the africans point of view is that foreign investment is primarily interested in profits uranium and other minerals should never come before people people and their freedoms should always in all places and at all times come first unfortunately the credo of foreign investment is minerals loot and plunder profits and complete annihilation of the africans at this stage of the twentieth century foreign investment channelled through the subsidiaries of the corporations in the metropolitan centers of the world have not only affected the governments of african countries but also have affected the internal politics by sheer force of economic circumstances which appears to be unavoidable the corporate operations directly affect the amount of foreign exchange brought into or taken from an african country in the small countries foreign investments have materially affected the position of the domestic currency the expansion of corporate activities also have affected the level of employment its wage policies have had a direct effect on the wage level the adverse effect of this has been the weakening of the government in power and the strengthening of the opposition in some countries the corporations have espoused the strengthening of inhumane practices perpetrated against the africans typical examples are the union of south africa and apartheid southern rhodesia and the dictatorship of the minority over the majority not only have foreign investments increased instability in the past currently or in this decade all the military coups have been planned and executed with the cooperation of local agents without belaboring this issue the practices of oil companies in places like nigeria algeria and libya have had their social destabilizing effects one may ask why no mention was made of the positive contributions of foreign investments i am well aware of such but the negative effects far outstrip the positive effects what the future will be i do not know emphatically it seems to me that reliance on foreign investment for africas industrialization is a pure case of delusion and postponement of what should be done corrective steps should be taken new policies should be devised so that the

ne of the first and most significant collections of afroamerican poetry the poetry of the negro edited by arna bontemps and langston hughes was published in for more than a decade this book was practically the onlyalthough a very richsource for the study and enjoyment of that vast body of poets whose race prevented them from taking welldeserved seats among their paler colleagues in the united states the poetry of the negro contains poems written between and by american poets of african descent eight of these poems are by one robert e hayden letter from the south a photograph of isadora duncan runagate runagate o daedalus fly away home homage to the empress of the blues eine kleine nachtmusik frederick douglass and a ballad of remembrance it took until the year when enterprising young dutchman paul breman a londoner by choice saw the quality and the importance of haydens writing to put a representative collection of his work before the public the publisher gave this book the name of a yearold poem and included five of the pieces from the anthology the poetry of the negro daedalus empress of the blues nachtmusik frederick douglass and that astonishingly contemporary poem a ballad of remembrance publishers or editors cannot just pick the poems they themselves like for a book they are about to publish there may and should be a dialogue between editor and poet but the creator of the work has of course the last word it is therefore remarkable that robert hayden who is one of his own works severest and most pitiless critics wanted these five poems of at least fifteen years ago to go into his london published volume that title poem is perhaps the most striking example of the total of robert haydens characteristics creativeness of image and language never obscure never out to baffle the reader always wanting to reach out to communicate are among the strongest and most valuable of these in his a ballad of remembrance quadroon mermaids afro angels black saints balanced upon the switchblades of that air and sang every time i read the ballad when i read it just with my eyes hearing the echo of the words singing inside me or when i read it aloud to make it communicate with people in an attempt to open their minds and ears to the voice of a true poet whenever or wherever i make contact with that ballad of remembrance i envy mark van doren to whom hayden addresses himself and therefore this is not only a ballad of remembrance but also mark van doren a poem of remembrance a gift a souvenir for you in that way every poets poem is a gift a souvenir to everyone who approaches it and robert hayden is one of the afroamerican poets whose precious gifts have far too long lain unheeded hayden is certainly not a protest poet in the usual sense of the word he would refuse that label as he refuses to be pigeonholed as a negro poet or as one whose negritude or raceidentification features as a basic quality of his poetry and still he is all that not primarily not deliberately not in prepense but naturally all that in him is truly instinct brainmatter diastole systole reflex action as he himself speaks of freedom and liberty as personified in the great frederick douglass at dakar as a member of the grand jury for the literature prizes and before the festival in the preselection jury in paris and london my colleagues and i tried to recognize the qualities of true poetry originality creativeness disciplined inspiration craftsmanship in the handling of the raw material namely the language ability to communicate the ability to sing via the printed word into the heart and mind of a reader on the great prizegiving night our jurychairman langston hughes proudly announced that robert e hayden of the united states was our poet laureate and that honorary mentions were given to derek walcott of the west indian island of st lucia for his book in a green night and to christopher okigbo of nigeria for his collection of poetry limits it had been a difficult choice still the jury thought that haydens work deserved the ultimate honor which could be awarded to a book of poetry published between january and september which has not received any other prizes or distinctions in during a visit at fisk i read robert haydens poem runagate at a meeting in which the poet was present runagate a dramatic poem about my private hero harriet tubman had been a favorite of mine for years in i was preparing my book i am the new negro a book in which i attempt to show through poems songs and documents the american negros own active yearslong freedom fight i asked hayden for permission to include runagate and got a completely new version and a letter from which i quote enclosed is the new version of runagate and i hope that it wont be too much of a trial you may not agree with me but i think its much better in places than the earlier one i should tell you this too it was your reading of runagate that night at the center which sent me back to the poem i hadnt looked at it for years had put it aside as another of my many failures hearing it i realized that it was not so bad as id thought i am asking the editors of negro digest to print both versions of runagate compare them see how painstakingly a conscientious poet works how he succeeds after years in stripping all sentimentality and extra dramatic effect from a piece and in giving it the ring of truth of clearer honesty give an hour of your time to a comparison of those two versions of the same poem and undergo the blessings of a true poets craftsmanship and of his sincere wish to impress and communicate through naked truth handled with an artists skill now that the dice have fallen feel justified in revealing the essence of the report concerning a ballad of remembrance issued by the preselection jury for the anglophone literary prizes in order to facilitate the work of the grand jury at dakar a ballad of remembrance consists of four sections four acts of a drama or four symphonic movements or the four seasons hayden is a remarkable craftsman a striking singer of words his extraordinary talent makes itself known in almost every line from the first quadroon mermaids afroangels black saints of the title poem to the thunderous final bars of his poem to frederick douglass when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful and terrible thing hayden writes about the land of his birth redbuds like momentary trees of an illusionist while in tour he tells of static villages whose names are all thats left of choctaw chickasaw children worldless and remote one moment we are on a road in kentucky or the coast of maine then we are facing bessie smith who shone that smile on us and put the lights to shame and sang in witch doctor africa melts into america africa shines through an elks parade too when jack johnson in his limousine made all the arid ghetto bloom with fantasies of ethiopia the third part of the book presents haydens remembrance of mexico descriptive passionate detached involved alienated all the dark the light the joy the pain the fourth part of the ballad probes deepest in a newfound idiom sounds and images deeply linked with visual impressions apotheosis and coda are the ballad of nat turner for the wheel in a turning wheel which is time in eternity had ceased its whirling and owl and moccassin panther and nameless beast and i were held like creatures fixed in flaming in fiery amber the last drumbeat then is for frederick douglass the preselection jury ranks robert haydens poetry with the best anglophone contemporary writing they recommend a ballad of remembrance most emphatically to the attention of the grand jury and to poet and friend robert hayden i want to say this at dakar the words negro and negritude negroness took on new meaning and new dignity negro means no more nor less than black african or of african descent without any emotional overtones negritude took on the meaning of unconditional acceptance of ones own individual self without any sense of inferiority or superiority it also refers to the awareness of certain aspects of group experiences in that respect i in my blanchitude can fully accept my negritude robert hayden belongs to the bahai world faith bahai is belief in the unity of all religions of all prophets in light half nightmare and half vision he speaks of the face of bahaullah prophet of the bahai faith in whose eyes hayden sees the suffering of the men and women who died at dachau and buchenwald for their specific negritude bahais believe in the unity of all mankind the universality of all of gods creation in haydens poem the prophet he speaks of the auroral darkness which is god and he sees energies like angels dance glorias of recognition they too sense their groupawareness and so the first world festival of negro arts has honoured an afroamericans artistic parity his natural negroness which is part of his natural humanness his americanness along with his universalness the human integrity of an artist and the artistic integrity of a fellowman writers converge at fisk university by david llorens springs fragrance filled the air friday evening april as writers civil_rights workers educators and students converged on the campus of fisk university in nashville to discuss the image of negro in american literature gathered in historical jubilee hall the nations oldest building of higher education for negroes reminded that the late w e b dubois passed this route while developing his genius an audience of about persons eagerly anticipated the opening remarks and the promise of a stimulating weekend for too long weve looked into the eyes of the white master for an image of ourselves and with those words john oliver killens authorinresidence at fisk and director of the conference issued the challenge that would provide excitement anger joy and intense probing until the closing address two days later by ossie davis novelistessayist saunders redding keynoting the conference noted that the negro writers situation has never been good and earned the audiences favor as he spoke of the american negro having been imprisoned in the culture and social assumption of the western worldusually held in derision or contempt scholarly somewhat military in bearing redding observed that honest writers seek ultimately to discover the human condition he cited the value of negritude calling it a relatively inexplicable mystique and drew a loud burst of applause with his suggestion that the literary mainstream resembles a sewer redding quoted expatriate novelist julian mayfields admonition that it would be better for the black writer to remain silent than accept the shoddy literary values of white america but for those who entertained the idea of a writers conference without provocation or controversy the keynote address proved the contrary preoccupation with repossessing a heritage has led to distortion of values and reality in some cases said redding in a preface to accusing some negro writers of making heroes out of heels in their fiction on the receiving end of his charge were john a williams night song chester himes if he hollers let him go rosa guy bird in my window and james baldwin another country there were those who subscribed to the distinguished professors accusations but it was noteworthy that the lone applause was delivered by bert gilden coauthor with his wife katya of the novel hurry sundown a conference participant who would later provide insight into his enthusiasm over the put down of baldwin to paraphrase redding baldwin created a characterrufus who failed to engage the sympathy intended by the author the ensuing question and answer session found various baldwinian sensibilities ruffled including that of a most unusual clergyman father james woodruff episcopal chaplain at fisk someone mistook him for white at the start but by sunday night everyone knew he was indeed black who was in no way inhibited by his collar woodruff and a conservatively bearded young man pressed the issue of heroes and heels but redding muscles tensed overpowered his adversaries with the plea oh lord i dont want to argue however the ingredients for battle had reached surface and tomorrow would be another day the novel and its social relevance to the negro revolution was the subject of saturdays opening panel discussion bert gilden john o killens and margaret halsey author of with malice toward some and the pseudoethic were the panelists once more the memory of dubois prevailed as killens recalled dubois prophecy that the problem of the twentieth century is the color line and that the future of the world would be what colored men make it folksy and peopleoriented whether talking or writing the author of black mans burden insisted that we black folk inhale tragedy with each breath we take according to killens civilized as applied to black people in white western culture is a euphemism for enslaved allowing that all propaganda is not art killens contended that all art is propaganda he asked when are you writers going to define some terms like integration liberalism nonviolence nationalism freedom and civil_rights there was laughter at his observation that most americans suffer from an edifice complex but mr killens was quite serious chuck has never listened to black writers unless they said what he wanted to hear the negro revolt is part and parcel of a worldwide revolution our literature should have social relevance to the world struggle and especially to the struggle of black americans killens cited the black artists responsibility for debrainwashing he then told of a session with a group of civil_rights workers that convinced him of the necessity for social relevance in literature the appearance later saturday evening of then sncc executive secretary james forman subsequently provided impetus for the conference authors halsey and gilden agreed that literature should have relevance to the social revolution but they were equally sensitive to certain hazards and limitations involved gilden charged novelists with the responsibility to present negroes without distortion as full fledged characters and was especially vehement in his appeal god forbid politics or social convictions influencing the work of the writer miss halsey warned that despair is inverted energy and contended that the writer must liberate energy although they did not deny that america is a racist society panelists halsey and gilden attributed this for the most part to the ignorance of white americans and miss halsey who was not present for the previous nights session introduced more hero debate this time in the form of sonny liston provoked by those contentions william melvin kelley led the questions which were of course comments as well from the floor fully bearded and sporting dark glasses prompting the question from at least one observer is that leroi jones novelist kelley stood held his notes in front of him and began what would be a very vocal weekend that left more than one observer puzzled my comments are directed at the two white panelists opened kelley you assume white people are ignorant i do not believe this exploitation has been unconscious you know alluding to ignorance as suggested by the two panelists kelley called it part of the liberal mechanismthe cop out it was difficult to believe that the same man who wrote the ivy league negro for esquire magazine a couple of years ago was talking when he explained in detail to miss halsey why sonny liston was a hero to the black cats in watts adding that he liston is not roy wilkins suggesting that the nation is a victim of calvinistic protestantism as he would reiterate all weekend kelley suggested that progress can only be achieved by overthrowing christianity as we know it pressed with regard to his agreement with redding on baldwins character rufus gilden acknowledged his agreement which led to a discussion of exactly what kind of character should engage sympathy a member of the audience accused redding and gilden of basing their conclusions on white western cultures imposed values and concepts of dignity he told them that art was meaningless if artists failed to discover meaningful ways of relating it to the problems of people and asserted that black people might still be oppressed years from now and if your art has not helped them it will be little more than a selfish possessionin fact a part of their exploitation gilden pressed the speaker for an explanation as to the values he was speaking of and asked what he would replace them with the answer was all values relating to economics which are the only ones respected in america must be replaced gilden later told a small group that there was no such thing as selfhatred among negroes which prompted someone to ask if his current novel will include negroes his affirmative response prompted the advice that he not attempt to create a negro character until you find out something about negroes by this time the enormous gap between the way white and black americans view the world was revealing itself both in and out of the official conference sessions the saturday afternoon session treatment of the negro in the novel found william melvin kelley on a panel which included katya gilden and the south african novelist and short story writer richard rive mrs gilden observed the tendency of american novelists to create characters from the dominant group in society and to assume universality she contended that the late richard wright limited his work to terror and helplessness which excluded much of negro life once again there was subtle reference to the hero and heels debate when she accused writers of creating monsters claiming that they are produced by segregation and thereby providing segregationists with material that is used to maintain segregation ie i dont want to live around those kind of people one of the more eloquent presentations of the conference was that of richard rive an engaging man who speaks in lucid british tones and skillfully uses humor his treatise on the use or misuse of the black characters in south african literature was informative his incisive criticism spared none white nor black painfully naive was the label attached to alan patons black characters believing a touch of morality would solve the problem and mr rive noted that the same could be said of many american writers the function of any writer anywhere is to protestprotest the functions of men said rive the best known of contemporary nonwhite south african writers peter abrahams fell into rives category of writers who are busy protesting their status as individuals rather than asserting their right to be the line of protest subscribed to by rive it is noteworthy that leroi jones in an essay written some three years ago made a similar comment on abrahams accusing him of outbaldwinning james with the plea for understanding as an individual a separate entity calling the novel a new art form william melvin kelley attributed the novels appearance to the appearance of the middleclass used to reflect the way they looked at their lives kelley proceeded to condemn capitalism created the middleclass the position relegated woman in the western world the pope renounced evil by renouncing woman and accused white people of trying to make malcolm_x a black beast one who seeks revenge when malcolm according to kelley didnt want to seek the revenge of the black beasthe wanted to rid himself of the white man kelley challenged the black writer to stop writing the protest novel and start writing the revolutionary novel and drew the loudest applause up to that point with his words stop writing imitation white novels to white people and start writing to black people mrs gilden asked if she agreed with kelleys remarks answered yes which begs the question whether or not one can write to black people as kelley suggests successfully while taking care not to create characters that segregationists will use to maintain segregation as suggested by mrs gulden the absence of leroi jones who was invited to the conference was frequently mentioned prior to saturday evenings panel poetry from the negro renaissance till today but the poets on hand while paying tribute to the young bard along the way provided the conferences most stimulating session at the helm were two gentlemen who were not strangers to very many people in the audience arna bontemps and robert hayden and two other poets margaret walker and melvin b tolson who heretofore were strangers to much of the audiencealbeit for quite different reasons margaret walker whose poem for my people written in won the yale prize for poetry has been teaching at jackson state college in jackson mississippi but her silence by no means resulted in her being behind the times as all would soon discover one attends a writers conference anticipating new ideas pertinent criticisms enhanced perspectives a touch of the inexplicable as well as the profoundbut one also secretly hopes for that person who will rise to the occasion and provide the emotional stimulus that transforms writers conferences into good old down home baptist conventionsfor at least a little while that stimulus was provided by melvin b tolson poet laureate of liberia the man described by karl shapiro as the poet who writes in negrowhich then takes us to the reason mr tolson was a stranger to so many in the audience now yearsold m b tolson has been writing poetry since he was twelve and in the meantime has worked at a multitude of occupations that run right through the alphabet including such jobs as stevedore janitor boxer drama director organizer of sharecroppers unions newspaper columnist and fourterm mayor of langston oklahoma the home of langston college where he was for many years a professor the diversity of his life is reflected in both his poetry and talk and the fact that he remains largely unknown according to shapiro is not because he is difficult to read which he is for difficulty of text is the stockintrade of the poetryteaching profession tolson is not read because he is a negro the white professional mind thinks that poetry is written by englishmen or their descendents and imitators nevertheless m b tolson in person shows none of the scars one anticipates from a man whose works were unjustly buried nor does the author of libretto for the republic of liberia rendezvous with america and harlem gallery in his dynamic approach to life and people reveal the effects of two recent serious operations returning to the panel what better choice than arna bontemps one might ask to bring us from those strolling twenties to these searing sixties he was on board all the way like our music our poetry is hard to pin downlikely to be marked with a special riff opened bontemps he remarked that although it followed the english tradition it did not hold it sacred a composed bontemps read poems from the days of the harlem renaissance written by his contemporaries he lauded the current younger poets but found none as precocious as langston hughes paul lawrence dunbar and countee cullen and observed that sterling brown is unsurpassed as a reader of tales the longtime fisk librarians attachment to and admiration for an old friend langston hughes was apparent throughout and along the route he warmly referred to the works of his fellow panelists citing robert haydens a ballad of remembrance published in england in he informed the audience that the book was awarded a prize at the world festival of negro arts which was concluding in dakar senegal in unison with the fisk conference one gets the idea hayden doesnt want to be labeled a negro poet doesnt exactly like that negro thing added bontemps but in his comment there was a touch of compassion and a world of understanding obviously he was speaking of a man he respected he informed the audience of margaret walkers forthcoming novel jubilee the first civil war novel to be written by a negro and said of tolson only recently was he fully recognized observing that racial awareness emerges from almost every line written by tolson allowing that the younger poet is epitomized by the fiery leroi jones bontemps hastened to add that there are others he considers just as important including m carl holman james emmanuel julian bond and dudley randall the detroit bard essayist and short story writer who attended the conference margaret walker capturing her audience with the gleaming brightness of a most friendly smile alluded to the twenties praising jean toomer a sensitive driver james weldon johnson erudite gentlemantalented poet and others of the era the thirties according to miss walker found the black poet brutalized stigmatized and ostracized her presentation included kind words for pulitzer prize winner gwendolyn brooks and the contention that leroi jones dominates the sixties because he has something to say labeling jones the rew inventor miss walker called his language new startling and bold adding that you must read a great deal of jones to really understand him to which saunders redding echoedbut not for all to hear an awful lot i have said this until i almost think ill choke and fall over backwards thus began a visibly disturbed robert hayden addressing himself to the argument as to whether one is a negro poet or as hayden insists a poet who happens to be a negro reading lines from yeats hayden solemnly commented i didnt have to be irish to love those lines lets quit saying were black writers writing to black folksit has been given importance it should not have haydens anticipation of opposition gave way to a slight stutter i dont think were consciously trying to escape his sensibility shaken to the point of anger hayden continued please notice thisall you folks sitting out there waiting to jump down my neck he proceeded to define poetry as the beauty of perception given form the art of saying the impossible the works of gloria oden previously unmentioned were praised by hayden miss oden is the new york poetlawyer who recently reminded negro writers of their privileged status in this republic while reprimanding them for failing to appeal for understanding from a predominantly white audience at last years writers conference at the new school in new york hayden concluded by informing those from whom he expected opposition on the matter of identity if they didnt accept his position baby thats your problem not mine the associate professor of english at fisk created a perfect setting for the entrance of mr tolson with just a touch of drama tolson spun a yarn around the fact of his not having brought a written text and waltzed right into a reflection of a visit to an old poets grave whereupon there was engraved on the tombstone am dead as all can see ye bear you all to follow me pausing his head tilt back as though in deep meditation tolson said that the words on the tombstone made him think and then respond to follow you im not content until i know which way you went and as laughter filled the hall tolson rose from his chair with the energy of one of his pupils and in a sweeping gesture and a booming voice that rocked jubilee hall he roared nobody writes in a vacuum or out of a vacuumwhen a man writes he tells me which way he went in society the audience now spellbound listened as the man who might affectionately be called the grandfather of the conference spoke of the tridimensionality of man a man has his biology his sociology and his psychologyand then he becomes a poet glancing over his shoulder at hayden the grin on his face reminiscent of a mischievous lad once again tolsons tone was soft almost reverent hap hap let me see hap means accident is someone going to make m b tolson an accident youll never make me an accident and by this time his voice was blazing to the rafters as he exclaimed im a black poet an africanamerican poet a negro poet im no accidentand i dont give a tinkers damn what you think signs of tolson the educator mixed with the poet the dramatist and what have you as he gave a discourse on the word negro starting with its beginning as an adjective and advancing to its origin as a noun at the hands of the portuguese in senegal observing that there was no stigma attached to it until the coming of christian civilization tolson blamed capitalism for the worlds race problem he alluded to a play written by leroi jones the toilet suggesting that this country for all its criticism and controversy did not really understand what mr jones was talking about that young man is a symbol of the times said tolson everyone thinks he was talking about a toilet in harlem he wasnt talking about a toilet in harlemhe was talking about an entire civilization that has become a commode when the intellectuals and the artists condemn a civilization that doesnt mean that that civilization is in troubleit means its on its way out as expected the panel discussion inspired talk from the floor concerning the question of identity among the concerned was the graying james forman once the baby faced member of the civil_rights big four i think the question of whether or not one identifies himself as a negro writer has bearing on the choice of material one writes about said forman the irrepressible sncc veteran called attention to the fact that many negro writers fail to address themselves to the struggle of black people in this country suggesting that this was in part due to a lack of identity observing that little has been written about the southern freedom movement excepting the sensationalismoriented newspaper accounts and occasional magazine articles forman contended that an awful lot of negro writers are completely out of touch with the movement defending the writers cause miss walker promised that sunday afternoons poetry reading would include new poems relating to the southern freedom movement citing the example of dubois voluminous writings during his days as an activist bontemps raised the question of the small quantity of writing done by the modern day activists voicing his amazement at this point a member of the audience explaining that he was formerly a movement activist and is now a sometime writer suggested that the analogy of dubois to the current civil_rights workers was not quite fair as each of you writers know the creative exercise is a painful one well i just want to say that those involved in the movement and i dont mean those who occasionally picket are involved in an exercise as painful as writing many of the activists have written articles for various magazines but to ask them to do a great deal of writing would be asking too much of any man the speaker obviously impatient with the inability of his voice to keep pace with his thoughts next addressed himself to hayden mr hayden i dont think jim forman is questioning your ability to identify yourself as a negro you said that you didnt think you were consciously trying to escape but is it not true that perhaps you are unconsciously trying but before he could finish hayden interrupted saying that he was tired of being attacked at every writers conference insisting that he have his say the speaker asserted the question of whether or not you identify yourself as a poet who happens to be a negro or as a negro poet does have effect on the students who come in contact with you at this university it is a fact that many young black people leave fisk terribly deluded and someone is responsible for their delusion i am suggesting that you do have a re sponsibility to them a responsibility to help them understand that they will become black poets black teachers or what have youand whether you like it or not that is your problem baby the conference momentum was in full gear as the playwrights alice childress loften mitchell and william branch assembled sunday morning for the final panel what are the dramatists saying the woes of the black playwright in america were articulated by william branch who suggested that today in new york there is less chance than or years ago of the black playwright being produced loften mitchell read an essay from black drama a book of essays he is writing on the american negro in the theatre depicting the oppressive conditions under which the black playwright is forced to function born in harlem a stones throw from jimmy baldwin mitchell an earthy character who exudes youthful humor suggested that we havent gotten free yet we got integratedthe double doublecross his label for integration caught on and was heard late into the night branch suave pipe smoking contended that things cant get worse and asserted that we can no longer wait for the white brother to come to his senses we must establish black theatre not shutting anyone out but looking inside our own experiences whitey just aint gonna do it babywere going to have to do it proudly exclaiming im from harlem and i am a negro writer alice childress affectionately stated all i know of generosity and kindness and love i learned in harlem imagine a rose saying im not a rose im a flower well i am a rose and a flower i am a negro writer and also a part of universal man and with those words the author of trouble in mind cast an intense warmth throughout the hall miss childress blamed white america for the fact that the negro artist cannot earn a living in his field and accused the oppressors of also telling us how to react to the oppression she concluded that she believes all mankind should have the opportunity to become his highest self the question and answer session consisted mostly of an exchange between william melvin kelley and panelists branch and childress concerning the subject of federal monies the two panelists especially miss childress spoke extensively of federal monies available to the arts advising negro artists to take advantage of them kelleys position was that it would be useless to depend upon federal money because the man is not going to give you money and let you destroy his system the bearded intellectual author of a different drummer and a drop of patience warned against falling into what he called the capitalistic bagthinking money will set you free the general tone of the entire discussion reflected recognition of the need to utilize federal funds but not without an awareness of the possible inhibitions and limitations inherent in accepting such money after finally getting the floor which by then was becoming a problem james forman explained that his reason for attending the conference was to present some specific areas in which he felt his organization could work together with the writers and expressed hope that there could be a fruitful dialogue between the artists and the activists before the conference adjourned john killens then suggested that a special meeting be held immediately following the closing address by ossie davis a suggestion which met with enthusiasm from the audience sunday afternoons poetry reading session was a moving experience reading from harlem gallery and his exciting collection of african proverbs tolson delighted the crowd before hastily departing to a writers conference at princeton university reading his very pensive full moon robert hayden masterfully engaged his audience humbly expressing satisfaction with his prize winning a ballad of remembrance his reading from it as well as others of his poems was received with a warm appreciation that was a tribute to his artistry i think the activists lend an electric effect to this conference stated arna bontemps as he dedicated his poem the daybreakers to the determined young people the audience seemed to share bontemps nostalgia as he read works untarnished by the passing years there was in the closing lines of his poem golgotha is a mountain a certain spiritual ecstasy and subtle powerblack men should own those mountains and l am one of them living up to her promise margaret walker read poems dedicated to her late friend and neighbor medgar evers as well as poems to malcolm_x and the three young mississippi martyrs cheney goodman and schwerner the suffering and struggle of black people were the ingredients for her work now time to wipe away the slime time to end this bloody crime and the spunky i like it fine here in jail following the poetry session john killens was honored with a book party for his volume of essays black mans burden in a tribute to the stem but jovial writer father woodruff called him fully integrated and free there is no smallness in the man it was standing room only in jubilee hall sunday evening for the conference finale ossie davis the actorplaywright was intro duced by killens as one who is concerned about where were going and how were going to get there addressing himself to the theme of the conference davis spoke of the importance of images recalling that some years ago the then senator lyndon baines johnson said that he could not subscribe to sending troops into southeast asia to fight a white mans war davis observed that johnson thereby created an image citing this nations present involvement in vietnam he contended that it necessitated johnsons creating a new image and the new image he sought was to make it a black mans war and that is the reason per cent of the american troops in vietnam are black the applause delayed his continuing images said mr davis must correspond to some accepted reality upon which people communicate and agree davis contended that we must find new images that correspond to the objective facts of our lives we must seek new languagefor the language of uncle tom like uncle tom himself is dead the audience roared approval when he praised malcolm_x saying that the late leader had advanced to the point where he thought like an africanamerican citing malcolms having moved the struggle from civil_rights to the question of human rights davis asserted that malcolm knew that we must organize friends in africa so that anytime a foot stepped on a black man on one continent a black mans mouth would yell in the other revolution calls for the black man to break away as the son from the father said davis and for determining which image will prevail will it be the image of the middleclass honorary white man asked davis such an image according to the author of purlie victorious has a need for nonviolence it is the image that says we can make it with education cleanliness politeness and he observed that such an image still prevails in most of our universities adding that it also says please dont mix civil_rights with peace davis continued i would like to think that american society is basically sound and that we can reform it i would like to think that i could come through the gates and rise with everyone else but with his mind seemingly immersed in the reality of todays america he stated integration comes too late because the reason we are in this country has been taken out from under us by automation citing the history of the united states the fact that black people were brought to these shores as a source of cheap labor davis chronicled the times up to the present today three out of four negro jobs the unskilled jobs are being taken away and this nation is in the unique position of having more workers producing services than goods davis pointed out the fact that black people have no value to the country in terms of the services produced and observed that america because it no longer depends upon the exportation of goods exports capitaland thats why were in vietnam and thats why well be in vietnam the dominican republic and south africa this country has vast business interest in south africa until the last black american is dead he concluded that the image of the middleclass honorary white man is not a satisfactory one suggesting that we must base our image on the dispossessed in our nations harlems davis advised that we must relate to other nations of the world who just happen to be nonwhite viewing the recent overthrow of kwame nkrumah in ghana davis refuted the reasons usually cited by the american press insisting that we consider the fact that cocoa ghanas leading source of revenue suffered a price drop from cents a pound to cents a pound nkrumah or no other man could hold a government together under that kind of pressure said davis and he left no doubt as to who he felt was responsible for the disaster we are artists who must dare to deal in truth but there was deep concern in his voice as he cautioned but be mindful that power when threatened will crush suggesting that we not waste time on petty hatred davis said that there are those on both sides who are dead to the future in a candid message to white americans he charged those of good will with the responsibility to go and become missionaries in their own communitieseducate that bigot and teach him that his fate is tied to mine alluding to the oftmentioned leroi jones davis called him a shattered young man saying that jones realizes what this culture has done to his people and knows that we must create a new language do you know asked davis that because of the connotation the word black has in this culture when you look at your child and call him black you have already insulted him different ways davis then advised the audience to consult rogets thesaurus where they would find about words of negative connotation opposite the word black as opposed to about three opposite the word white leroi jones is aware of these facts said davis contending that we must arrive at a new image davis said it must have elements based on the man in the gutter and it must appeal to him if we accomplish this the writer will be the father of a new country davis concluded that black people in the face of oppression once came up with john henryand now it is your challenge to go home and do for automation what john henry did for the steam drill john killens made the closing observation that he was glad to see james forman and the activists at the conference because they know the importance of obtaining a new image and creating a new language among those present was cleveland sellers sncc program director speaking on behalf of the fisk university writers workshop mignon k holland an aspiring novelist expressed gratitude for the foresight and dedication of resigning fisk president stephen j wright without whom john killens brainchild would not have become a reality the conference officially closed but as planned the meeting of the minds continued in the post conference session resulting in plans for a meeting of artists and activists to be held in new york in june it was the first writers conference conducted on the campus of a major negro university and will rightfully take its place in historical annals a days living by dolores armstead t the top of the staira p way nell stood listeng ing for her daughters voice there was no sound the child was still asleep go now she intoned as she slowly descended the flight of wet and slippery stairs across the street three sister buildings gaped and shrank together as icecored snow fell through their demolished roofs down the razed skeletons to where furnaces had croaked up warmth for the flesh of a few aged jews and rooting puerto ricans nell ran in the beating snow impatiently bumping against the white hills of frozen garbage going in the direction of the subway at the essex street crossing she became aware of a whirwhir chaining close around her it was the snowplows moving in like battleships on the deep white sea her boots bleat as she darted in front of one of the scooping bullies the snow belting her face stung like stones but she could not turn back in her pocket were two subway tokens and she had to exchange them for thirty cents that would buy one quart of milk for her child past the winking neon of golds appetizers she ran then like the command of a master hypnotist the thing she feared asserted itself at the proper point of her mission she walked back to golds and gazed into the window there was only one clerk behind the counter the right one the three customers in the aisle were a dark fat blur nell entered the shop stood with her back to the candy and eyed the sturgeon once she had bought strings of licorice here and as before there seemed something comic about the wizened herring in their pickling barrels reposing ruefully across the aisle from pastel mints and bon bons the clerk deftly rolled a pound of fish in thick wrappings for a bent old man while two girls fussed over sweets ill be right with you the clerk said to nell she turned away not yet willing to meet his eyes she felt cold and numb and she wished for a warming drink yet she wanted her cold insides to freeze every instinct that might betray the approaching tide of lies when the customers left the clerk walked up the aisle toward her i came to ask a favor of you nell blurted as if to stall his approach whereve you been the clerk said around she said slowly gaining control i feel awfully silly asking she smiled prettily but will you give me thirty cents for these two subway tokens the tokens gleamed on the brown palm of her glove why didnt you come back that night i wasoh kind of scared she answered still with the guarded innocent smile scared of me i waited for you i looked in the streets for you believe me youve been on my mind since that one night you came in the store nearly drove me crazy when you didnt come back like you said you shouldnt do something like that he held her arm as if she might fly or sink im sorry nell sighed shaking her scarf to her shoulders but ive got a kid you see shes two and i didnt have anyone to stay with her that night he passed his hand over her hair and nell felt a thickening at her scalp as if the roots were kinking from sweat are you married he asked sseparated she said not knowing if it was the truth or a lie id like to see you could i visit you sometime i supposebut my husband pops up every now and then we could go out dinner a show ill pay your sitter i dont know anybody around here to get for a sitter whos with the kid now i left her sleeping she said i had to come out look will you do me a favor and give me thirty cents for these two tokens you need change i need milk for my baby she rapped this darned blizzard were practically starving her thoughts strayed to herman he couldnt leave the baby he was a good father to the baby even when they fought hell come back she reasoned just as soon as the storm breaks the clerk put two quarts of milk in a paper bag were one of the few places still got milk in this blizzard no delivery what else you want you can have anything in the store only milk she said craving the expensive sturgeon take some candy to the kid he put chocolate covered jellies and mints into a bag and placed the packages beside her whats your name nell she said nellie he chuckled reaching for her hand my names sol lets go in the back of the store nellie show you my office slowly she trudged to the rear he turned to face her his eyes were large and pale as a shadow they grew large and urgent as an alms plate he was a lonely man he was married hed had a summer affair with another colored girl like you nellie with fire in her eyes data related like routine instructions before an examination nell looked around for a chair he pulled her close she had to keep back the tears he didnt want her for back alleys she was beautiful he wanted to help her he had to have her nell drooped with the blow of a migraine as he alluded to intimacy they could enjoy kiss me nellie she leaned stiffly toward him and he pressed his body against her she rubbed a trembling hand against his chest fighting not to push him away youre my girl he said sol i she could think of nothing to say and she could no longer smile what would you do if the store was closed and i had you here with me how can i get in touch with you if she leaned against the crates that lined the wall of the narrow room heres my card sol said call me tomorrow around seven he took her hand and led her back to the front of the store nell looked around at the fish and the bon bons she buttoned her coat and tied the scarf in a hard knot under chin sol she began slowly will you give me the money for these tokens he dug into his pocket here take this no she said looking at the folded bill just exchange the tokens please fair trade go on take it he insisted i want to help you ok thanks she took the folded bill stuck it inside her glove with his card thank you for the milk and candy too we can work things out he said youll see ill treat you nice you call me tomorrow i think youre very kind with a measure of compassion she looked into his eyes searching for a glint of light among the shadowy grey a woman swathed in mink entered the shop and sol was at once behind the counter glancing at nell only an instant more nell gathered her packages and slipped away the cold the snow and tears bit into her cheeks she unfolded the bill he had given her a dollar she could buy a little food why harlem needs a cultural center by dr esther jackson harlem need a cultural center the answer is obviously yes in the sixties we in america are beginning to recognize that the arts are a necessary element of all human experience a component as basic to the lifeprocess as food shelter or clothing the arts are not forms of decoration they relate to the entire process of human learning to the total pattern of mans imaginative symbolic and creative activity when we speak of the arts therefore we do not restrict our consideration to conventional forms such as painting sculpture literature dance and drama we refer to the entire range of created symbols which give concrete shape to human consciousness not simply architecture and painting but also roads bridges and trestles not merely sculpture and crafts but also spacecraft and missiles not alone poetry music and dance but also equations theorems and propositions not only scenery and costumes but also furniture jewelry and dress we are in short concerned with the whole of mans created life with his rituals myths images social structures and patterns of intellectual life as well as with his expressive forms indeed those forms which we describe as theatre music literature dance and the plastic arts are but the expressions of a larger and more complex pattern of activity which is at once individual and collective in nature the chief function of the arts is to give shape to the complete world of human experience but the arts have a second function in society they are not only charged with signifying the basic content of experience they are in many senses a technique of discovery the arts are lenses through which men see interpret and evaluate experience it is because of this intimate relationship to seeing and knowing that they are so important to us at this point in american history we owe to the great philosopher john deweyamong othersa better understanding of the role of the arts in the intellectual social psychological and moral growth of the individual dewey described the function of the arts as instrumental for they not only reflect what the creator thinks about reality they affect the way in which other individuals interpret that same reality the influence of the arts as a moral agent has concerned writers from the time of plato to our own day what may be even more important in this discussion however is the effect of the arts on the total process of learning contemporary theories of learning would seem to support the contention that many intellectual skills understandings and knowledges have their origins in the arts that the symbolic structure of the arts is fundamental to all learning we contend that the acquisition of learning in fields as seemingly dissimilar as mathematics literature and the social sciences is de pendent in large measure on a single factor the presence of a mature flexible and appropriate system of symbols an individual cannot think about indeed perhaps cannot even recognize thingsinthemselves unless he has within his imagination a clear and appropriate symbol intellectual development and growth seem thus to be dependent on the quality maturity accuracy and reliability of symbolic structures it is in large measure through exposure to the arts that primary symbolic structures develop art is not then a decorative exterior applied to the surface of experience it is rather the concrete evidence of a way of viewing reality it follows that every individual like every community has such a pattern that is to say every individual like every communityhas an imaginative structure through which it sees interprets and evaluates life in such a structure we may find a critical measure of the intellectual social psychological and moral values of the community every individual in every community reads some kinds of literature wears some kinds of clothes and jewelry participates in some kinds of rituals shares some myths lives in some kind of architecture enjoys some dramatic experiences hears music creates verse develops ideas and finally seeks to find beauty harmony truth and meaning in his life that which distinguishes one kind of arts structure from another is not motive rather it is the quality of those created forms which the individual and society jointly evolve art may thus be sophisticated or naive lifeaffirming or lifenegating harmonious or disordered subjective or objective immature or highly developed misleading or enlightening permanent in value or frankly topical in general then we may say that the arts mirror the stage of development to which the communitylike the individual creatorhas come we in the harlem community today are not as much concerned with this representational aspect of the arts as we are with their effect upon the individual and the group for we recognize the arts as an unequalled teaching device which speaks not only of those concrete truths which are the province of the sciences but also of those ambiguous and elusive forms of understanding which affect human behaviour at its unreasoning roots if the sciences and the social sciences speak of those areas of human experience which are judged to be within the effective control of reason the arts are concerned with those areas of human behaviour which are manifestly without the arts speak of those hidden areas of human consciousness in which our drives have their origin of love and hate fear and courage suffering and joy beauty and ugliness and of tranquility and violence moreover it is the arts which dare to speak of these areas of human behaviour with complete relevance accuracy and candour when we talk of a program in the arts for this community we are not speaking of a performance schedule nor do we conceive primarily of a building rather we look forward to the launching of a total community effort which will not only seek to mirror that stage of growth at which we now find ourselves but which will be concerned with the development of that kind of symbolic and imaginative activity which will improve and enhance the quality of our individual and collective experience such a program cannot concern itself entirely with the reflection of things as they are nor yet with the glorification of things as they were rather it must devote its attention to the creation of life as it ought to be we must ask ourselves what does such a program have to contribute to the improvement of life in the harlem community to greater political economic social and cultural opportunity to the constructive use of conflict to the development of better interpersonal relationships to the effective use of personal capabilities to the acceleration of individual achievements to the motivation of higher standards to the clarification of human problems to the projection of more desirable values to the creation of a physical environment of greater beauty to the stimulation of a greater sense of personal appreciation to the development of a sense of joy to the swift achievement of social justice an arts center in harlem should then provide a base for the projection of these universal values in the communityatlarge but such a center has in an even more complex task for harlem is not an ordinary american community it is a community which has survived extended exploitation and which yet suffers social psychological economic and cultural ills which are reflected in the lives of its population one of the clear objectives of an arts program in such an area is to contribute to the eradication of the conditions of such exploitation the function of an arts center cannot be therefore to lock the doors of the community against the world rather the purpose of such a center must be to provide the residents of the community with such personal resources as will radically accelerate their potential growth and substantially increase their contact with the larger world clearly the emphasis of such a program must be on the young especially on that segment of the population which is less than years of age the projected center cannot afford to develop programs which are restricted to the job interests and cultural patterns of older generations of harlemdwellers rather our clear mandate is to increase opportunity for the young by broadening the range and improving the quality of cultural experience the harlem center must not capitulate to the wellmeaning exponents of separate but equal art nor can it seek to repeat many patterns of programming which were successful in eras of more limited opportunity the harlem center must not be seen as an alternative to participation in institutions such as the lincoln center or the new york shakespeare festival or the museum of modern art it ought not be regarded as an escape from our clear responsibility to insist on the speedy desegregation of career opportunities in the major cultural institutions of this and other cities in america rather the harlem cultural center should provide the negro community with an effective base from which its campaign to desegregate the arts in new york city and in americaatlarge may be effectively launched it would seem to me then that the proposed center has five specific functions to support the formal educational process by providing the citizens of the harlem community with a representative selection of the finest examples of world art to offer systematic assistance to gifted young people in the development of their own talents to expose all young people to that basic arts experience which is fundamental to creative achievement in all professions and careers and which is an essential instrument in the pursuit of happiness to equip young people with those verbal and intellectual skills aesthetic concepts and moral values which we in america believe to be prerequisite to professional and personal advancement in the world of the twentieth century to provide a home for the large community of gifted performers who have failed to gain appropriate opportunities and rewards because of discriminatory practice in the arts and at the same time to offer broader opportunities to gifted performers of all racial and ethnic groups to demonstrate that desegregation in the arts may be achieved in america to the advantage of the artist the profession the spectator and the nationatlarge how can these objectives be achieved certainly the establishment of a program of such comprehensive intent requires an apparatus of great efficiency there are subsumed in these objectives four areas for immediate action professional and preprofessional training audience education social and educational services community action if we are to realize our common goals for the center a plan for action in each of these four areas must precede the establishment of physical facilities such a plan should bring into effective and appropriate conjunction the activities of existent community structures certainly the program of the center should be viewed as a supplement rather than as an alternative to systematic arts education in the public school curriculum in the same way any proposed plan for professional and preprofessional training in the arts must be developed with regard for established standards of creative performance a different kind of coordination is required to develop a program which is supportive of the goals of social agencies and religious organizations and finally the center must assume the major role in our struggle to desegregate the arts particularly to open serious opportunities for career growth and development in those institutions which are partially or wholly supported by public subsidy the center both in terms of theory and example should serve as a lever in the larger struggle for cultural opportunity in american life from it should issue an intensive drive to insure systematic advancement in the arts for talented members of all minority groups but more than this the center must provide a plan of action which will not only advance the careers of performing artists but which will open career opportunities in the hundreds of supportive occupations associated with the arts the drive for equal opportunity in the arts must not be conceived alone to affect actors musicians painters dancers and writers but also designers technicians costumers business managers advertising copyists choreographers directors arrangers and museum workers clearly the key to these advances is community action an action which is not restricted to artists alone but which engages the efforts of our political and professional leadership in the nationatlarge for the future of the arts in our country will to a large degree be determined by the future of the arts in new york new york in many senses the cultural capital of the world is perhaps of unequalled importance as a symbol of the cause of unlimited human opportunity and so it is that the time for a civil_rights program in the arts has clearly come the necessity of such action becomes even clearer when we realize that vast new funds for the support of the arts will soon be available through legislative action the antipoverty bill the elementary and secondary education bill andwe hopethe arts and humanities bill promise to support the growth of the arts throughout the country the harlem community not only has a right it has a clear responsibility to insist that taxderived funds shall not be used to reenforce pervasive patterns of discrimination against negro artists spectators and school children festival postscripts ie hopes that the story is apocryphal the way it goes the prime movers of the american committee for the first world festival of negro arts were considering which group of musicians to invite to dakar as exemplars of jazz music in america benny goodman and his sidemen were mentioned but it was remembered that the state department already had sent them on such a tour then woody herman and his orchestra were suggested and the idea was received with much enthusiasm but then someone asked the number of negroes in mr hermans current herd as it turned out duke ellington and his orchestra were chosen as the musicians to carry the message of jazz to dakar but the above storywhether apocryphal or true tells much about the orientation of the american committee in the first place only a few thousand american negroes knew anything about either the american committee or the first world festival of negro arts itself for an event of such importance in the negro world this neglect was all but criminal the selection of mrs virginia innessbrown as chairman of the american committee was an incredibly obvious blunder mrs innessbrown is a wealthy new yorker with an avid interest in the theatre she has many friends in high places including the government in washington and she can call on these people for support in her charitable work apparently her concern for projects affecting negroes is genuine however that is not the point mrs innessbrown is white and it should be immediately clear to anyone with knowledge of contemporary realities that it simply is not appropriate that a white person be the head of a committee for a festival of negro arts not surprisingly then the same kind of thinking that went into the selection of a white person as chairman of the american committee was evident in the selecting of american participants in the festival there is no quarrel with the choice of duke ellington this great musician cannot be overhonored and his reception at dakar was eloquent proof of the acceptance of his work in the negro world however most of the other choices were less wise the american committee chose armenta adams a classical pianist and martina arroyo a soprano who recently appeared at the metropolitan opera and while both are fine artists they were all but wasted at dakar there is nothing particularly negro about a pianist playing bach preludes and a soprano singing verdi arias that they can perform this music superbly is one thing but the performance of it at a festival of negro arts is quite another the same observations are pertinent relative to the selection of leonard de paur and his chorus to appear at dakar mr de paur is a gentleman of superior intellectual and musical attainments but there is little that is negro about his musical presentation beyond the fact that he and most of the men in his chorus are black it is true that the chorus introduced a brace of african tunes enchantingly done but that program would be infinitely more effective before an american or europeanor even japaneseaudience or for that matter before an african audience so long as the context is not one of negro arts africans do them more authentically it so happened that the most inspired choice of the american committee received the least adequate showcasing and consequently failed of potential impact marion williams and her gospel singers brought a measure of excitement to the festival but the group performed only in the cathedral of dakar which has poor acoustics and limited capacity misses adams and arroyo also appeared in the cathedral to unfortunate effect this amazonian woman and her rhythmic singing and clever showmanship captured the audience but the audience was primarily white with a sprinkling of upperclass africans the reason more than per cent of the senegalese are moslems and the masses do not feel comfortable or welcome for that matterin a christian house of worship it was not the american committees fault that miss williams and her group were not scheduled for the seat daniel sorano theatre or for the outdoor stadium it was a question of priorities and the other american performersellington and de paur had higher priority however there was some embarrassment expressed by highly placed americans relative to the uninhibited performance of the gospel singers miss williams and her singers lacked dignity it was claimed and told that it was a pity that the masses of africans would not have the benefit of miss williams art one director of the festival a frenchman replied but what does it matter everyone of any importance is here at the cathedral everyone of any importance when the audience consisted of only a few hundred people most of whom were white such unfortunately were some of the attitudes which contributed to disappointments at the festival at the last minute the day before the festival ended the alvin ailey dancers appeared at the daniel sorano theatre andfrom all reportssalvaged the sagging prestige of the american representation mr aileys troupe arrived from rome substituting for the arthur mitchell dance group which due to lack of funds cancelled out it was in all probability a good thing that mr mitchell did not come mr mitchell is a fine ballet dancer but mr ailey whose forte is modern dancing is less oriented toward the classical mr ailey brought some fresh ethnic feeling to the festival the world festival of negro arts at dakar was billed as the first looking toward a similar festival every two years there is by no means any assurance that there will be a second festival but one hopes that there will be and if there is one hopes that the american committee for the festival will have a broader base and will include among its active members negroes who are interested in and who make an identification withthe ordinary negro people of this country last january in dakar mrs innessbrown was told that the american committee for the festival had failed to communicate with the general negro public those for whom such a festival would mean most in terms of education and spiritual regeneration a white new york public relations firm had been hired to publicize the festival and this firm proceeded in what must be its normal way of reaching its public no special effort was made to interest the negro press for instance in fact mrs innessbrown was told that the white public relations firm concentrated on white newspapers and magazines most of which are in new york and it was pointed out to her that the new york times for example had limited negro readership even in new york it also was pointed out to mrs innessbrown that the white press had scant interest in a world festival of negro arts a contention which was borne out by the paltry publicity accorded the festival in the american press only life magazine devoted more than minimal photo space to the festival and few papers besides the new york times and the washington post published more than a single report of the festival both time and newsweek ignored it it is inconceivable that the american press would have remained so indifferent to say a world festival of western white arts and mrs innessbrown was informed of this fact she disagreed as did the cultural attache of the american embassy at dakar but both learned that the american press indeed has limited interest in events concerning negroes despite the large negro readership in american cities the american committee worked closely with the state department in planning american participation in the festival and there is little question that this collaboration had a significant influence on the quality of the american representation the state department contributed at least in the way of expenses rescuing the committee which failed utterly to find its minimum budget of it is reported that the state department was at first reluctant to be identified with the festival on the grounds that its emphasis on negritude gave it racist overtones the us state department these days is all for integration the state department did agree to help the american committee and there was little doubt at dakar that the state departments assistance was crucial to the functioning of the american committee however there remains the question of whether state department collaboration is entirely desirable that question becomes especially pertinent if that collaboration also means endorsement and approval of artists and performers slated to participate in the festival would the state department approve the appearance of jazz musicians or blues singers who have been convicted as narcotics addicts for example or would writers who have consistently opposed the governments position in cuba the dominican republic and vietnam receive state department approval in both instances the answer is probablyand understandably no and yet such musicians and writers are likely to be among the negro artists who could bring to a world festival the essence of the negro experience in america mrs innessbrown also was told that many american negro artists were not participating in the festival because they objected to the fact that a white person was chairman of the american committee it was explained that there was not necessarily any specific objection to mrs innessbrown as a person but only to the fact of the chairman being white it did not seem appropriate unfortunately mrs innessbrown seemed to feel that the objections were personal during the discussion mrs inat thies detroit artist henri king visited atelier of friend papa ibra tall one of senegals top painters tall directs school of design and tapestry nessbrown made an important point which needs to be stated and accentuated she said that negroes generally do not support charitable or cultural projects andthe inference wasthat it was necessary that someone like herself take the helm in order to assure the success of such projects as the festival efforts had been made she said to collect from negroes some of the budget necessary for the american committee but that negroes had contributed virtually nothing later several wellknown negroes in attendance at the festival were asked about mrs innessbrowns contention and they agreed that the lady indeed spoke the truth the wife of an american negro diplomat recalled the years when the naacp sought desperatelyand without successto collect funds from negroes only weeks earlier in chicago harry belafonte sidney poitier mahalia jackson and dick gregory had participated in a rally which raised more than for civil_rights work and this was cited as an example of how negroes cooperated today when they were led to feel that they were involved in a project or movement this was an example it was said of how negroes feel and act now but is it if the chairmanship of the american committee for the second world festival of negro arts goes as it should to a negro will the negroes in this country come to the support of the committee and assure it of enough money to send truly representative performers and artists to participate in the festival will they mrs innessbrown indicated that following the first world festival of negro arts she would keep the festival committee alive and perhaps organize something like a foundation to aid young negro artists in pursuing their studies and their crafts it is a laudable plan and it is hoped that it will be realized however if there is going to be another festival it also is hoped that efforts will be made to find some able negro to head the american committee it also is hoped that efforts will be made to involve the negro public in the festival the originators of the festival conceived it as a living illustration of the concept of negritude and the negroes of americamore than those of any other country or continentneed to understand and to give attention to that concept hoyt w fulle who needs negro digest with so many other magazines on the marketfrom the big slick picture magazines to the thin intellectual journalssuch a magazine as negro digest might appear almost irrelevant but who nowadays calls the negros aspirations writings thoughts and actions irrelevant this is what negro digest is all about negro digest is the only such magazine that frankly reveals what the people of color arc doing saying and thinking as reflected in its articles essays general features short stories forums informational notes poetry and priceless humor negro oigl provides an outlet for wellknownas well as the new and young articulate writers and thinkers and provides a source for those seeking negro historical facts guidance and information important to ones wellbeing perhaps this is why negro digest has been called the most stimulating magazine on the market by teachers housewives professionals and others who are aware in the true sense of the word who needs negro digest not every person but then not every person dares to think honestly and creatively about shaping his own destiny improving the lives of others or changing even a small corner of the world in which he lives such thoughts are too uncomfortable they have been known to start revolutions while watching the rew cent pattersonclay fight an interesting thought occurred to me as the two dark sinewy goliaths danced about like ideas under the bright american klieg lights in a fundamental sense the difference between these two people is that patterson is a negro and clay is a man it occurred to me that the image of uncle tom is not a dangerous one in this country but the image of the negro is but before i go further perhaps i should first define him the negro is a man of apparent african ancestry he was born and has since lived in american society he lives and works with people a vast majority of whom have no apparent african ancestry he takes a dim view of his own african ancestry and knows little usually absolutely nothing about it if he adopts a foreign country it will more likely be a european than an african or eastern one he believes his racial lineage is a dark secret hopelessly muddled by intertribal interracial interbreeding after the arrival of the african slaves in the new world hence his past is considered of little or no significance to him in his present life his entire world is defined by the presence the opinions and the attitudes of the white majority who live in his society he relies upon their aid and good will for his health his safety and his general welfare and is conscious as he is constantly reminded of this reliance he accepts this majoritys standards of speech dress and behavior as his own and pushes himself and his family to achieve them he envies and admires their station in life their standard of living and their physical characteristics he harbors no resentment no malice no repugnancy no indignation for any catastrophe suffered by any of his race at the hand of the white majority except as these may be provoked by an isolated event he aspires to be loved by all people and puts special stock in expressions of love and respect or consideration as these may come to him from white people he has ambivalent attitudes toward other negroes and is generally envious of those above him in education or status as he despises and finds himself unable to understand those beneath him in education and status because in truth he has no history no race no class and no identity he is at the same time every man and no man he is in a word what the white man has made him what kind of posture should be expected of a manand throughout this discussion man should be underlinedwith black skin in the american environment would such a man be indignant at his treatment some of the time most of the time all of the time would he express his indignation at every opportunity rarely ever james baldwin has said that to be black in america and be reasonably perceptive is to be in a constant state of rage if this be true and i believe it is what is meant when a quiet obsequious understanding negro is known by whites as a good negro a nice colored fellow an i wish all negroes were like you type person the answer is that he is being recognized as a negro and an opinion is being reserved not expressed or negatively expressed on the question of his manhood hence the statements should have little meaning except to white people and should cause black people to wince one cannot drive in neutral along the ways and byways of race in this country particularly if you are of color the massiveness of the experience has a way of posturing you from the negro one knows not what to expect for he is rather like a straw in the wind being tossed hither and thither by the vagaries of his own thought and that of the majority culture which dictates its content for the man who has black skin there is no doubt as to his posture so long as the plight of his people is as bad as it is you may expect at the very least an intelligent demurrer more often than not when the question of race is brought up he is indignant the emotion is not unhealthy psychologically or socially given the problems to be solved in our racially sick society the most constructive emotion is that which leads to indignation and a resolve to do something about the situation only a man a full human being has the capacity both to feel indignation and methodically resolve to dry up its source at any cost nonhumans like dogs can be pulled by the ears and kicked in the rump by a master for years and when thrown a bit of sap will forget the earlier indignities overlook the vulnerability to future indignities and yelp with unrestrained glee the same may be observed of babies who suffer indignities before the age of intelligent perception the same may not be said of men nor of nations or not of such of these as have survived the surest evidence that the negro has not been granted the right to manhood in this country is seen in the denial of the right to be indignant however the right to indignation i would defend is the right to intelligent indignation this is not an attempt at snobbishness rather it is a recognition that in any mature society temper tantrums are not long and regularly to be tolerated from adults this brings us to a consideration of the variety of indignation expressed by the black muslims which this writer is not prepared unequivocally to defend the muslims are considered a hate group not so much because their social doctrine necessitates it but rather because they do such unintelligent things as making ceremonious reference to whites as devils the enemy and worse such childish rhetoric is totally unnecessary and superfluous to the ends the muslims themselves seek the muslim creed represents a variety a brand of black nationalism the central theoretic assumption of black nationalism is that before the negro can ever be truly free he must effect a psychic separation from the idea of whiteness that is he must stop believing in it so much that he cannot believe in himself the muslim idea of a separate state is a reification of this slightly more complex notion and it puts it by making it concrete in terms the uneducated layman can grasp if one can entertain the notion of a physical separation from whites and can accept this idea with equanimity then it becomes proportionately easier to come to grips with the idea of a mere psychological separation the muslims realize and rightly so that it is impossible utterly impossible for a negro to be consistently of service to his people so long as he is hung up on the idea of whiteness and all this entails their aim is to make the socalled socalled negro of use to the race as a whole they realize they must first pry him away from his obsession with whiteness and they try to do this in the only way they presently know to do it as often happens in the affairs of men they fail because there means defeat their ends every organization or individual does have the prerogative to express its or his indignation in any way seen fit intelligent or unintelligent the unfortunate thing about the muslim choice is that an otherwise excellent program for individual and group improvement is drowned out in a course of hostility from negroes and whites alike their program could succeed without the allegiance of whites but not without that of blacks white opinion in america unfortunately runs only a truncated course before it becomes negro opinion though the converse of this is rarely true and thisthe logic of thisthe muslims have not been careful to bear in mind one report that a muslim publication has headlined the white race as devils shapes more attitudes than a million reports of positive accomplishments by the group in large part because the white race is paranoid about such things and in equally large part because opinion in america is shaped by newspapers and television and these media feast on the sensational rather than the qualitatively newsworthy unless the muslims change their miserable public relations the logic of this is that the possibility of the organization ever becoming an effective force in the black community is nil none and the negro will live on in all his vainglory yet they are to be complimented for reflecting more humanness than negroes or negro organizations are generally able to muster when they are hurt they bleed and become indignant and humane people respect them for this human beings respect all human beings who become indignant in the face of civil wrongs human beings are not expected to act as negroes have acted in the face of outrages and many people have marveled at the patience and restraint managed by the negro freely translated this means that they would not have been so restrained had the outrages been committed against them but then they are not negroes so there you have it for a time negroes stopped acting like negroes and their organizations stopped acting like negro organizations and for the first time the negro people had a whiff of manhood in the early s the wife of a famous white southern judge who tired of the negro charades in south carolina was forced to exclaim if you want to know what i think you people can do you can stop praying and get off your knees and fight shortly thereafter a wave of negro indignation did sweep the country and people all over the world rallied behind the negro cause as they saw an angry people take to the streets invade theretofore sanctimonious private property and serve notice in a very often violent and vituperative tone that they were fed up and wanted the white man to get his foot off the black mans throatin a word saying everything the muslims have said since the time of fardexcept that white people were not called spineless devils for the first time people came to talk of the courage and bravery of negroes at a time when they were doing battle with the white community rather than when they were engaged in the obsequious waiting action the negro himself took pride in his new posture and many for the first time could greet caucasians with heads held high people began to talk of a sense of pride and dignity felt by the young people who participated in the demonstrations the truth is that for the first time these peopleoften against the better judgment of their elders abandoned their negroness and became human beings this is the most crucial question that must be posed and answered before there can be a solution to the race problem in the united states it is in a word whether it is possible to be both negro and human what kind of category is negro does it rule out indignation pride dignity given our situation in american society it is here submitted that we are only human when we are angry or indignant like king in pursuit of injustice or cassius clay when he faces a white world that would forbid his being anything other than their image of a negro when we achieve our racial manhood we will live daily with a resolution to protect our sense of self worth in the fullest possible manner and perhaps the negro will of necessity be laid to rest in relative peace with uncle tom how many negroes read the new york daily news the los angeles times the new york times presumably substantial numbers the audiences of such journals like the audiences of the television news shows are not segregated and yet the negro already fighting against the neighborhood school and de facto segregation in housing has to contend with still another separatist institution the press what is usually called the pressas in power of or freedom ofis a white press distinctly different from negro press the white press plays two roles in the race situation first because negroes read it it is one of the agencies through which the pervasive ideas of the culture are introduced into the ghetto at the same time the press unconsciously reinforces white attitudes which make it impossible for the negro to escape from the ghetto one of the pervasive ideas in american society is that publicity is a great healing agent once a bad situation has been exposed the belief is it somehow magically goes away the negro cause has had wide publicity in recent years a good deal of the publicity has been concerned with the funerals of negro martyrs but legislation voting rights riots and negro leadership have had a large amount of journalistic attention too in the minds of many middleclass white people this publicity solves the problem who needs a house if hes got the headlines the negro poor for their part have discovered to their subsequent embitterment that despite all the tv newspaper and magazine coverage of race relations the rats go right on biting the babies in harlem thus a social phenomenonthe nationwide belief in the curative powers of publicity has increased tension between negro and caucasian the white press obviously aspires to influence thought for it employs besides its regular editorial writers whole coveys of commentators syndicated columnists writers of thinkpieces pundits political experts etc but over and over these opinionmakers unwittingly reveal that they write for the white communitys point of view and not as spokesmen for the whole republic for example when there are negro riots the white editorialists point out that the negro leaders are middle class and cannot control the negro poor but they omit to mentionnot out of unscrupulousness but because it does not occur to themthat there are no white leaders who can control the white poor bombings night riding beatings up intimidation and assassination are activities of the white poor which parallel negro riots and from local mayor to american president from local constabulary to the fbi there have been no white leaders able to control them a famous political columnist announcing after the rochester riots of that the black community must learn to discipline its unruly elements is voicing the sentiments of a white press similarly the idea is often put forward in the press that the negro should be worthy of the vote whereas in america nobody has to be worthy of the vote the right to vote is something one is born with if he is an american citizen and save for convicted felons it cannot be withheld on grounds that ones behavior fails to please more than that a vote is something that belongs to an individual as a right it has nothing to do with a group to which he may belong negroes are adjured by caucasian journalists to obey the law of the land no matter what their grievances and respect for the law is held up to them by these writers as an obligation which takes precedence over any injury however lasting or however mortal only a bare handful of the political deansand sages remember to add to their exhortation to negroes the reminder to whites that a law on the books is meaningless if it is not properly enforced according to drew pearsons syndicated column of september which reads more as if it came from the negro press than the white only four registrars had as of then been provided for the entire state of mississippi there is supposed to be one registrar per county and there are counties in the state the law of the land rhetoric impresses white readers but must it not convince negroes that american journalism insofar as it tries to influence opinion is basically dedicated to the status quo and the continuing comfort and convenience of white people negroes cannot possibly forget that the murderer of medgar evers has not been convicted nor the murderers of emmett till the murderers of the three young civil_rights workers and the murderers of countless other negroes or friends of the negro a negros experience with and reaction to the law of the land is different from a white mans and unless the white reader is also reading the negro press he cannot safely feel that he has gotten the full picture one liberal white columnist with an otherwise good record for supporting the negro cause recently stated that the adam powells precisely because they were congress men with power to get things done are chiefly responsible for the miserable conditions of their own districts but how much power do ghetto congressmen have in reality in the event that adam powell had had a vision on the road to damascus and become quite a different person could he have cleaned up and regenerated harlem to give them credit the opinionmakers in the white press rarely themselves maintain that the negroes are going too far and too fast but many of them quote with editorial clucking sounds polls which allege that large numbers of white people feel this way and thus give their readers a kind of crowd sanction for obstructionist feelings and perhaps actionsabout racial equality when negroes march and pray and demonstrate in the streets and cause trouble they are frequently toldin newspapers white people readthat they are doing their cause more harm than good and that they should take their wrongs to court the negro has been in the courts for a long time the supreme court decision of was the culmination of many years struggle in the courts and back in the s the naacp under the leadership of such men as walter white began to fight case after weary case in state and federal courts to end jim crow in interstate buses that was the beginning of the negro strugglenot given publicity until a generation later for integration in public accommodations law and order is not just a matter of negroes putting a lid on their anger or bluecoated policemen putting it on for them to an astonishing extent negroes have themselves shown a respect for law and order behaving with restraint even under severe provocation but law and orderif they are to be lasting and reliable rather than momentary and precariousmust have a sound basis in attitudes and feelings from crispus attucks through thomas wentworth higginsons black regiment to the present leaders of the negro revolution negroes have played a part in american history but when a negro who is aware of this sits down in a negotiating situation with a white man who thinks negroes were merely passive objects for whom lincoln wrote the emancipation proclamation there is a good chance of there being no meeting of the mind perhaps there ought to be more negroes writing for the press with full freedom to explain themselves and to say what is in their hearts then when a white commentator in paragraphs read by millions of white readerswarns negroes hot to alienate the white community a negro commentator in the adjoining column could remind these same readers that many negroes live in hourly peril of the uncontrolled white poor without ade quate protection against injury in advance or redress after it has been inflicted the negro revolution has become almost a comfortable phrase so much has it been in peoples mouths denial of voting rights has had enough coverage so that many whites think that once all the negroes in the country are free to vote unhindered the negro revolution will have succeeded and will pass from the headlines to be heard no more but negro leadership of all kinds both conservative and radical is aware that that is almost a soapopera version of the reality the schools negro children should be attending have not yet been built the teachers who should be instructing in those schools have not yet been hired the housing which should accommodate negroes exists only in token form these things cost money the money can be provided in sufficient quantity only by diverting funds from one or more of our current preoccupations from the space program from the highway program which supports the automobile industry or from the war in vietnam negroes have never been included on terms of equality in our socioeconomic system spending the money to include themand there is no other way they can be brought inwill involve a major reconstruction of our society the press is an established institution and as such is not by nature friendly to the idea of drastic social change but it could contribute substantially to an orderly transition into the future by becoming aware of its own parochial quality it is within the power of the press to make negroes feel less like voices crying in the wilderness and more like people who are being listened to it is within the power of the press to open the eyes of white people to their own insularity i am speaking as a i white to the whites in the civil_rights movement who threaten at times with their blundering ignorant good intentions to dominate its organizations thereby forcing the negro people to resist this new white superiority and paternalism a minor policy decision was being debated in our local naacp branch meeting the branch the only negro civil_rights organization in this small northern city has spoken for its five percent negro population over the years trying to defend it against as unconsciously cruel and arrogant a white power structure as any that has penned the negro populations in the great ghettos of chicago or new york the naacp here is not yet a mass organization the anger and outrage of our negro community is only beginning to coalesce in organized action present at the meeting were some of the old and faithful negro members a few new ones and the new white liberals wearing the ostentatious smugness that is the reward for salving the conscience with good works the discussion continued for some minutes it was not strictly a blackwhite debate for the negro members were divided on the question the new white liberals were not they were on their feet eager and opinionated i listened without deciding my position quickly i was really not certain that i knew enough to form an intelligent opinion i would vote with the man whose judgment of the problem i most respected and i presumed that vote would be against the white liberal bloc i was right but the white liberal votes carried the motion at the heart of the civil_rights movement in the north the fundamental questions continue to be debated whose civil_rights movement should the basic policymaking within it remain with the negroes if so where do the whites belong should they be relegated to some sort of secondclass citizenship within the movement but is not this the antithesis of the democratic and egalitarian goals of the movement every day of our lives our whole white western culture teaches us that we the white people are superior to the darkskinned peoples of the world without this basic tenet the entire value system of our culture is invalid yet within this culture arises the pity and compassion that lead many whites to civil_rights activity this is still white superioritythe newest and most enlightened master on the plantation but no less a plantation even the writings of white men of courage and good will reflect this they imply in effect i am infinitely sorry for you because you are black for it is better to be white than black but because you had the misfortune to be born black i will fight for your opportunity and right to try to be as white as i the civil_rights movement does not need these new masters possibly this is the only way a white can approach the negro people and the civil_rights movement his whiteness his western culture are the norm and the goal what else they are indivisible from him like every other white i brought my superiority to the civil_rights movement tempered by the uncomfortable realization that my white skin was probably an offense to some of my negro associates this much i had learned from the negro writers that white is not better than black that the negro people do not want to be white and that many of them dislike whites for excellent reasons it was faintly humiliating that i should be suspect for no better reason than the accident of my skin color then unexpectedly i began to move in my white western culture and so to discover for the first time that it was a prison and not the universe the movement was involuntary and as sudden as an optical trick when a prismatic picture in an instant assumes a different perspective and will not resume its former appearance no matter how hard one stares at it i went out into the street one morning and the crowd of passing white faces were strange faces that i saw for the first time without relation to myself their color the shape of their features was alien and unattractive i sought the occasional negro faces that now looked the way faces ought to look faces that could have some relation to me the faces of strangers in a crowd have never resumed their former perspective the white faces are alien the dark ones familiar this new movement within my white western prison has become a small step toward freedom to see to know and to understand a step into an unutterable loneliness for i am estranged from most white people and i know that i can never pass beyond the barrier of color that separates me from even those negro people i love and am close to we reach toward each other across the barrier with love and need knowing it will remain perhaps a friend in harlem where i was living best defined it youre here now with me but you can go back downtown any day you choose neither of us expected i would but we knew i could we knew i could be accepted without question in white communities that would deny him the right to walk down the street beside me i can never begin to pay my dues for they will never be exacted of me he and every other black person in america pay theirs daily their bitter understanding comes high i would be a fool to expect it free another friend told me sometimes i think for a moment that i hate all whites we both knew at those moments i must be not her friend but just another white were we not close she could not have told me this and i could not have accepted it i am in limbo lonely and free and to try to return to the security of my white prison would be impossible and intolerable thus i approach the negro people no longer with compassion or pity for they are stronger and more free than the whites imprisoned in their western culture i am sorrowful and angry at the treatment of negroes but i cannot pity them simply because they are black pity is for inferiors i know now that i need to live in the negro community among the negro people because that is now where i belong i know my need for them is greater than their need for me ever could be this is not to say that black is better than white there is no better or worse i do not now wish i were black but i am profoundly sorry that i have spent most of my life in prison because i am white and i am afraid i shall never be able to forgive my white western culture for lying to me that it was the universe instead of a prison the negro tots in the ghettos are being gathered swiftly into project head start to remedy the supposed cultural lag their ghettoliving has imposed on them how much more deprived are the white tots in the suburbs and how infinitely greater their need for a crash program to free them from their prisons but there will be no program because those who control programs do not acknowledge their world is a prison for me now activity in the civil_rights movement becomes an attempt to be a good citizen in the negro community where i am necessarily the new and ignorant immigrant i know that i will never walk down the street with a black skin and therefore i can never know with my blood and bones what it is to be a negro for this reason i will never attempt to make policy in the civil_rights movement although i will help with what skills i may have my white skin has made me incapable of ever knowing and understanding the negro community well enough to contribute anything worthwhile to basic decisionmaking for this i do not blame myself nor do my negro friends they and i must accept my heritage probably other whites in the civil_rights movement find themselves in this same position some whites i know are masters on the new plantation to them i say and it may seem blunt and cruel as long as you bring your white superiority and paternalism to the civil_rights movement all your good intentions even your courage and sacrifices are useless and offensive to the negro people negroes do not tell you this for most of them are more polite than i and they tolerate you for your good intentions no free men need despots to direct them least of all the negro people who have been used by white despots in america for centuries they do not want to live on your new plantation let the negroes speak and decide they not you know best this time if you can accept this you may one day move beyond your white prison one of the current tenets of political science is the importance of the middle class in maintaining both a democracy and a stable governmental structure this is another classic illustration of confusing that which is created with the act of creation what is importantto democracy and to the permanency of governmentis the struggle to join the middle class and not the existence of the middle class per se the distinction drawn above has serious implications for the future of the negro in american democracyand for the future of that democracy professor nicholas rashevsky has demonstrated that a high degree of conformity may tend to reduce the stability of a political system this supports the contention that maintenance of the status quo the lode star of the conservatives which requires conformity is dysfunctional to democracy those who would support the status quo and maintain our society in a state of equilibrium have failed to recognize that in such a society there is no growth no evolution to quote karl deutsch even a casual reading of de tocquevilles the old regime and the french revolution cannot help but impress one with the fact that the middle class in france had never had it so good as in the years immediately preceding the revolution also that the middle class in contradistinction to the monarchy was adamant in its refusal to include the lower class in the benefits of government it was this impermeability of the middle class in france in russia in italy and in germany which can be seen as the root cause of the rise of the authoritarian regimes which had their genesis in the middle class this also is the prospect facing america today there is a noticeable hardening of the line between those who have and those who havenot the maintenance of this line is the prime concern of conservatives proof of this is seen in the coalition of southern democrats and republican conservatives to scuttle through recommittal all measures designed to ameliorate the conditions of the havenots democracy of all the forms of government is peculiar in possessing a dynamic quality it alone of the worlds political systems possesses the qualities to make it a selfdeveloping or selfenhancing system without this dynamic it would become moribund and be transformed into a static state quickly to wither and disappear this dynamic is derived primarily from one political actthe movement of the lower class into the middle class it is this ferment which provides the changes in governmental actions which prevent the hardening of the arteries of democracy the circular movement of those from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top is an essential characteristic of democracy the american revolution was far more than a fight over taxation without representation it was in essence a revolt against the status quoand more importantly a fight to enter the middle class which englands restrictive commercial policies prevented the colonists from joining the protection of englands rising middle class meant using the colony as a source of raw materials and as a consumer of manufactured goods the result was a revolting development to george iii and the beginnings of a middle class in america the current war on poverty is not designed to effect the functional changes in government which the problems of the poor the young the unemployed and the aged demand as howard k smith said in a recent speech it is inconceivable that the richest nation in the world should have the second highest rate of unemployment of the industrialized nations the poverty program is not empowered to tackle such problems as sources of jobs or an adequate means of livelihood for the aged and those unable to work nor can it tackle such problems as housing and the needed infrastructures of schools libraries community centers and hospitals to name only a few of the deficiencies of our society today in social services as statistics show the united states is falling behind other countries one basic area for example is in the number of hospital beds per capita by the governments own statistics the economy can be kept in balance only by cutting taxes or increasing the budget yet the house district of columbia committee forced an increase in the income tax rate of those below the poverty level no effort is being made to increase public expenditures or to decrease the taxes paid by those for whom the payment means being deprived of food the poverty program however will have an important byproduct and one which its proponents probably did not foresee the programs are aimed at stirring the poor from their lethargy and with that stirring will come a demand for the organic changes which are inherent in the phrase the revolution of rising expectations the ferment for change does not arise in those who have no hope for change or do not see it as benefitting them so this byproduct of a program which was rejected by the coalition of conservatives because it will threaten their ability to maintain the status quo will serve to trigger the demand for more basic changes in the distribution of the benefits of government in the great liberal movement in england in the th century there was a strong connection between the efforts of the nobility to broaden the benefits of government to include the poor and the poors reliance upon the nobility to help them it was this liaison which provided the force behind the political changes which eventually revolutionized politics in england this same force is missing in this country today as a result of this void there is no force operating to moderate change and as a result the government continues to operate as a part of the corporate state this trend has been increasing as we move farther away from the great depression it can be seen in the recent republican cry for more guns and less butter this is a typical tactic to deprive the poor of the benefits of government and to preserve the benefits for those who can afford conspicuous consumption with this trend go all the correlates of lessened democracy more police action decreased protection of the rights of the individual lower taxes on greater incomes and most important the reduced ability of the poor to participate in the decisions of government the desire of the poor to participate is met with a cry of mobocracy significantly the right to vote means little when it is nullified by the imposition of economic sanctions this reduction of the ability of the poor to participate in government is the most damaging attack on democracy for it means a reduced electorate this is the real meaning of the opposition to the civil_rights bill the voting rights bill and the home rule bill for the district of columbia the defeat of home rule for the people in washington means success in a drive to destroy the foundation stone of democracyrepresentation it is an attack on our fundamental belief in local government for if the people in washington are unfit to govern themselves then what large city is capable this is only the latest and most successful attempt to reduce the electorate and to prevent any union between the poor and the believers in democracy for unless the conservatives can succeed in this the benefits of government are apt to be distributed too widely one of the postulates of downs economic theory of democracy is that the economic decisions of a rational government in a democracy are biased against consumers and in favor of producers his reciprocal correlate is that democratic government policies tend to favor lowincome receivers as a class rather than high income receivers consequently because the free market produces a highly unequal distribution of income the more effective democracy becomes politically the greater is government interference with the operation of the economy the conservatives refuse to accept this concomitant result of the free market greater government interference with the economy and a greater distribution of rewards to the low income groups yet as downs points out so clearly it is only with these offsetting actions that democracy can maintain itself and it is with an effective democracy that a majority of the citizens of the united states are concerned when democracy loses its dynamism it developes a state of equilibrium in a state of equilibrium there can be no upward or downward movement of the people society becomes frozen into a status quo in the united states the gap between the haves and the havenots is steadily increasing this too is the condition of the poor countries of the world the gap between them and the few rich countries is widening consequently just as we have not been able to solve our domestic problems so have we not been able to solve our foreign policy problems the ideal of the greek polis was that all citizens participated in government however the viability of the state rested upon a slave economy and the slaves were not citizens one modern political theory that of professor gabriel almond argues that a democracy requires that a proportion of its citizens play no part in government this nonparticipating group or parochials is a cushion which permits government to be managed by a few participants this theory assumes that the participants in government will consider the needs of the nonparticipants equitably no evidence has been brought forth to support this theory professor almond has merely ratified in a theory the status quo as he found it more to the point is carl friedrichs argument that every sane member of the state must be able to be a political person and to take part in the decisions of government without this a democracy degenerates into an oligarchy in name as well as in fact majority rule means little when a large group of people are unable to participate meaningfully in the determination of their fates and today as never before the government does determine the fates of its people if as all the foregoing would seem to indicate we are engaged in a struggle to maintain the status quo and with it to destroy the dynamic of democracy what then can serve to rekindle this essential dynamism it has been suggested previously that this dynamism rests upon the movement into and out of the middle class the largest group to whom the doors of democracy remain closed is the negro hence in a rare bit of paradox it rests upon the former slaves to restore the ideal of the polis to reality while the negro is only a part of those disenfranchised from receiving the benefits of democracy it is upon him that the burden rests to enfranchise everyone it is upon the efforts of the negro to penetrate the middle class that the prevention of a state of equilibrium depends unless equilibrium is prevented democracy will decline into corporatism the concern of the middle class over what the poor will do if they are permitted to better their lot is an old story it was seen in when the congress was considering the fair labor standards act some of the members and many of those testifying against the act were concerned over what the workers would do with their leisure time if they were not forced to work long hours for low pay secretary of labor frances perkins reply to them is as pertinent today as it was then they will do the same things the rich do with their spare time this concern over the morals of the poor if they are no longer so poor can be seen as a reflection of the middle class understanding of its own actions the rise in the divorce rate is a phenomenon of the middle class the poor cannot afford the luxury paradoxically the rise in the crime rate is viewed by those supporting the status quo as another reason why the negro should not agitate to join the middle class yet the negro effort to improve his position is a means of reducing the crime rateif the middle class is free of crime defrauding the federal government through price rigging is obviously a prerogative of the upper middle class so is peddling government influence the industrial revolution beginning after the civil war marked a period of corruption in business and government unequalled in our history this cataclysmic period of rugged change represented an almost wholesale movement to join the middle class the tactics used to suppress the poor then are equalled only by the tactics still used in the south to maintain a cheap labor market it was this violent effort to produce change which remodeled the face of america violence was justified then as defense of property rights those who were successful now decry violence in defense of human rights those bloody years and they continued through the s were in defense of the status quo the right of those who have to have and the denial of the right to all others those were the years which laid the foundation of americas greatness those were dynamic years for the economy if not for democracy the dynamic has gone out of the economy it is continuing to expand but as has been pointed out those at the bottom are sinking lower as the top rises higher there is no servomechanism in a democracy which acts as a governor to brake the decline of the poor they must do this for themselves and the only way they can do it is through agitation to force society to adjust its economic social and political policies so that all will benefit equitably in the proceeds of democracy the imperatives of democracy are many but none is more basic than that summed up in the phrase to promote the general welfare it is enshrined in our constitution as a fundamental tenet to which all who believe in the constitution must subscribe recently the executive director of the international association of police chiefs said we are tired of the cry that because one segment of our population has been deprived for years the balance of society must accept years of anarchy the director is of course confused to struggle to participate in a democracy is not anarchy it is only to seek to perpetuate the existence of that democracy certainly this means upsetting the equilibrium of society just as society was upset during the industrial revolution when the great bulk of the middle class was being formed the great danger to democracy as history plainly shows is when there is equilibrium and the frustration of change our problem today is not to worry about achieving complete democracy our problem is to keep striving for it how are we to advance democracy the answer would seem to lie in the negroin his determination to participate in all the aspects of democracy this means as watts has shown a disequilibrium in society and the safeguarding of democracy since the supreme court decisionalmost twelve years ago declared integration of schools in the united states to be the law of the land it is necessary to consider an aspect which flows from this decision namely the need for and progress toward integration of the materials of learning and teaching this refers to lesson plans teaching units textbooks graphs charts pictures and audio and visual aids it should be evident that integration in education is not achieved by merely permitting negro and white children to sit together in the same classrooms or to attend the same schools an examination of the learning materials which have been in use is in order they too should be imbued with the same democratic concept which brought forth the historic decision if the negro child is short changed by being set apart in a segregated school it is found that he has been doubly harmed when the teaching materials are examined relative to their treatment of him in general either there is slight reference or complete omission of the negros cultural and historical contribution or such materials are ridden with misconceptions stereotypes and slanting distortions such treatment only serves to strengthen the white majority in their superiority attitude while the negro minority is led further into accepting the myth of inferiority naturally these learning materials reflect the attitude of the society in which we live the writers of these materials and those who produce them have been reluctant to admit that negroes have made any real contribution to the history or culture of the united states or to world civilization for that matter why have the contributions of the negro been ignored or distorted in our learning materials because the truth i submit would be a direct refutation of the philosophy of white supremacy which is prevalent in our country the history and culture of the negro has been presented in terms of a people who are passive stupid and incapable of creative efforts this has been reflected in the thinking and writing of many eminent historians and textbook writers unfortunately this point of view has been mirrored in curriculums texts and learning materials through the years for this reason not only has the negro citizenry been denied truth knowledge training and skills but white america has been deprived of an appreciation of the contributions of a large segment of their fellow citizens thus the white child grows into adulthood with a sense of false superiority based on the color of his skin alone he feels that he does not have to try that all he has to do is to be white this concept ends in rude disillusionment and mental upsets when persons with this outlook come face to face with the realities of life when the truth is presented these people will find that all peoplewhite yellow red and yes blackhave made worthwhile contributions to society civilization and american life and history and have helped to make a better life for all mankind they will find that there is no room in the life of an intelligent and cultured person for prejudice and racism a correct portrayal of the contributions of the negro to american history in textbooks and teaching materials will not only benefit the negro child but the white child will be the richer if this information is made available to him he will receive a realistic concept of the contributions of anglosaxons to society civilization and the building of the united states previously his conception of his role in society has been distorted principally to bolster the theory of white supremacy just as the negro child from infancy has been given false impressions so also has the white child the biased presentation of his cultural contribution has harmed the negro child in many ways there is a direct connection between the question of a positive image for the negro american and the programs to aid the poverty stricken and culturally deprived negroes are culturally deprived and poverty stricken in the sense that they are lacking in knowledge of self the millions of dollars appropriated to combat these conditions in our country might well go down the drain unless this question of identity positive self image heritage negro historycall it what you willis faced up to only through a positive reorientation on this matter will the negro american regain his dignity of fourhundred years standing in his country a bit closer to home however the problem of school drop outs among negro youth is closely related to this question school systems all over the country are grappling with this problem has it occurred to the counselors and community workers on behalf of such programs that there is a kinship between school drop outs especially in the case of negro students and the absence of positive knowledge regarding the negro in learning materials we cannot expect the negro child to have positive images to identify with if he is seldom presented with a positive image the void is not only evident in the books he reads but is equally apparent in the pictures and films he sees and in the stories he is told about people who have made heroic contributions from nursery school through college he is confronted with a black black outa brainwashing that says in a hundred different ways whites achieve and progress and blacks do not and of course he is able to observe that the color bias operates in a manner to make it possible for whites to realize their aspirations on their merit ability or talent and to thwart and frustrate blacks with ambition denied knowledge of the participation of his people in the building of the united states and the fulfillment of the american dream the negro child grows up lacking a true sense of his own worth and future potential believing that he is nothing and knowing nothing from nothing leaves nothing he fails to aspire herein are some of the real roots of a negro school drop out failing to receive a sense of pride in accomplishment identity and belonging such young people may well lose faith in their democratic heritage this further emphasizes the need for a reexamination of learning materials in respect to the true contributions of the negro this gap in the education of negro youth must be filled his pride in the accomplishment of his forebears will instill confidence in the future inspired with meaningful examples after which they might pattern their lives negro youth will enrich the entire american society with their deeds integration of the materials of teaching and learning will not only enrich the school population of the country but will delineate the full intent of the supreme court decision this calls for additional research and much revision and rewriting the path of least resistance is to refuse to recognize the problem and to continue in the old way with the biased materials and the conventional and accepted outlook but how long can we keep our heads buried in the sand throughout this country there is a clamor from integrationists and civil_rights groups for school systems to do something about the inclusion of the teaching of negro history they mean by this the integration of teaching materials their demands are proper and few school boards or systems would disagree however lacking from these groups are practical suggestions for the implementation of their demands a school board or system is faced with certain questions are current texts and materials to be junked revised or rewritten is socalled negro history true american history to be taught in predominantly negro schools or in all of the schools will the publishers or producers of such materials take the initiative to provide them for the school systems or will the school systems have to create and produce their own materials the solution to the problem is intricate but it is not unsolvable herein will be found exciting work for historians textbook and juvenile writers curriculum and guidance workers teachers and last but not least publishers and producers of these materials since heretofore such little attention has been paid to these materials many will have to be ereated the missing pages of history relating to the negro will have to be written into units lesson plans readers language and historical texts they will have to be diagramed and drawn into pictures charts films film strips and recorded onto tapes and records since only an infinitesimal amount of this material is available school systems themselves may well have to take the responsibility of producing their own materials if the publishers fail to provide it committees of teachers administrators and specialists in the field of negro literature and history might be appointed to review and make recommendations for positive changes and additions to texts curriculums courses of study learning units and teaching materials their aim should be to reflect the positive contributions not only of the negro to society civilization and american history but of other ethnic groups who have been neglected or ignored as a result of such surveys school systems could then inform the publishers of what they wish to have included in the materials which they purchase or they may endeavor to produce their own materials similarly to what has been done in detroit washington dc and new york city such a program will be costly but the price of educational and cultural deprivation must be paid if we wish to bolster and protect our democracy the nation will not only be enriched but it will be doubly reimbursed if it brings out of this period of turbulent social strife a proud united new generation of american youth the white youth cognizant of and respectful of their negro fellow citizens the negro youth a proud american who has found his identity the needs are obvious if through our inaction we render ourselves helpless in the face of this great challenge it is almost certain that we also will render ourselves helpless toward making the american dream more than just a dream in his powerful work i the wretched of the earth which has been called a revolutionary bible frantz fanon made this brilliant observation now the fellah the unemployed man the starving native do not lay a claim to the truth they do not say that they are the truth for they are the truth fanons words were written with direct reference to the masses of natives visavis the native intellectual or the native who had adopted the forms of thought of the colonialist bourgeoisie at the time of the writing fanon was one of the most articulate spokesmen for the algerian revolution but inherent in fanons writings was a profound concern for oppressed blacksthe colonized the world over including this land that he described as a former european colony that decided to catch up with europe according to fanon it succeeded so well that the united states of america became a monster in which the taints the sickness and the inhumanity of europe have grown to appalling dimensions it is interesting to note that his early death of cancer which occurred on these shores might possibly have been avoided had he not feared coming to this country for treatment a bit ironic perhaps but his fears were not so unreal nor were they based on myth for they are the truthso simple so mighty and so many implications and the fellah fanon spoke of very definitely inhabits this land and he isin this land no less the truth than in fanons adopted algeria we have for so many years attempted to avoid him to not see him and upon seeing him we have pretended that we did not but we know who the fellah is in this country but the fellah in recent times has forced us to look at him to see him and he has made it increasingly difficult for us to deny his pres ence and his condition moreover he has forced us to listen to him to hear himalbeit our response to him more often than not makes one wonder we have seen him erupt in harlem and watts and we heard him through the voice of brother malcolmand to think that malcolm did not speak for the fellah simply because they were not card carrying followers is really not to think at all let us for our purposes define the chosen ones quite simply those blacks among us who in words actions inaction and indifferenceand we know who we arelay a claim to the truth the fellah also knows who we are after all we are so easily identified but the marks of identification that come to mind are not so superficial as the clothes we wear or the houses we live in more precisely the chosen ones are given to a pattern of thought and reflex that is indeed pronounced one of the more obvious marks of identity of the chosen ones is the predictable nature of their telling comments on the fellah the chosen ones comments on the fellah for the most part lack validity and are often quite unintelligent although the chosen ones think themselves rather learnedhowever they are indeed telling to be sure they are telling about ourselves another mark of identity is the chosen ones reactions to the fellahhis words his actions and his very existence the right to which is often challenged by the reactionary nature of the chosen ones but alas the chosen ones manage to sympathize with the fellah when he rebels or do they perhaps it is more accurate to say that the chosen ones experience a vicarious orgasm of the soul when the fellah rebels for you see in a very real sense the fellah is rebelling for the chosen ones who with such painful ramifications have conceded the right to rebel for the right to be among the chosen ones the right to serve the guardian and the guardian of course is the white man and to elaborate on the exceptions is to indulge in futile exercise whitey is the guardian who not out of kindness or brotherhood or any such myth but out of intense fear has taken upon himself the chosen ones in a desperate attempt to protect himself from the fellah with unequaled resolve he has designed in this valley of rampant timidity a peculiar niche wherein the chosen ones reside in all their misery and the suffering of the chosen ones is apparent for many reasons paramount among the reasons for their misery is the inescapable fact that in each of the chosen ones there dwells some fellah that same fury is cradled in his psyche that same desperation buried in the pit of his belly but unlike the fellah when his emotions demand that he rebel his debt to the guardianthose special dues of the chosen onesdemands that he repress although the indoctrination of the chosen ones has insured certain mechanical reactions to given situations involving the fellah his emotions do not and perhaps cannot respond to this specific indoctrination emotionally the chosen one remains a fellah hence his emotional response is in direct conflict with his physical response resulting in a vicious paradox witness the language of the chosen ones within the confines of safety they will talk of things being soulful nitty gritty and funky but they will unfailingly avoid this ethnic behaviour whenever the atmosphere suggests that their place might be jeopardized in the presence of the guardian the chosen one is allowed to act like a fellah only if the guardian is acting like a fellahand exceptions to this rule are extremely rare let the fellah choose the wrong time and place to become emotional or funky and witness the chosen ones squirm and cringe as their roots become like terrible scorching fires a young black lady a very chosen one who in her words belongs to a very high class church recently conveyed the following incident to me one sunday morning in the presence of a white friend she turned on the tv only to be confronted with the spectacle of a negro church service where they fellahs one guesses were carry ing on she confided that it made her very ashamed i inquired why and asked her if there was something wrong with people praising their god in their way she allowed that there was really nothing wrong with it but that she just thought we should keep such things to ourselves it is rather interesting that she a chosen one should use the pronoun we but nevertheless not at all surprising for even the most catholic episcopal unitarian or what have you among the chosen ones cannot avoid identification with the holy rollers although in complete control of the physical characteristics or manifestations of the fellah in themselves the chosen ones are unable to contain its inevitable rise and at its mildest the fellah in them is much more baptist than catholic but through further questioning i discovered there was much more to her shame it seems that her white friends head drooped at the spectacle alas embarrassed of course the chosen ones obligation to protect the guardian is at that precise moment primary what follows might well be described as emotional prostitution it is sad enough that the chosen ones bag requires that they stand before the guardian begging for that thing called freedom but what is even more sad is that they think it their responsibility to free the guardian from the selfinflicted psychologythe guiltthat makes a guardians head droop at the sight of those uninhibited holy rolling fellahs and the head droopers and their would be saviours in their collective misery are seemingly incapable of reasoning that if the fellah did not spend all that precious time holy rolling it is quite possible that he would spend it making molotov cocktailsand there are those who would suggest that the production of such might produce more real christians than all of the high class churches have managed to produce to date in this land each of us who has at some juncture played the role of the chosen onewhether by choice or circumstancecan recall at least one cringing experience about ten years ago while riding a bus en route to school a shabbily dressed black man sat next to me he proceeded without apparent qualm to pull out a hamburgerand began feasting well it so happened that there was a shortage of brothers on that bus but there were many guardians present now lets face it if that had been a bus full of brothers i probably would have said something like dig baby my mans goin for himselfwhich translated is like proclaiming the cat soulful or something similarand my emotions would have been quite safe at any rate i would not have been embarrassed by such an incident on a bus full of brothersand what brother would have been but with all those guardians present and my head filled with all that phenomena that once passed as values i did what all good chosen ones would have done then and still do today i squeezed against the side of the bus face flush against the window and did my damndest to pretend that either i or my hamburger eating brother the fellah did not exist and that the incident was not really happening what choice did i have how else might i have preserved the pride of the chosen ones and whats a squashed nose when so much is at stake but and i find this very sad it was perhaps four or five years later before i was finally able to question my reaction to the incident before i began to understand it on that harsh day it was so simple for me to condemn the fellah for causing me such great pain he caused me pain well blinded by the cruel plight of the chosen ones i certainly thought he did after all i would not have eaten a hamburger on a bus well perhaps on a bus full of brothers maybe and therefore it was wrongcertainly not very cultured is that not the usual method employed by the chosen ones to condemn the fellahi would not have done it i suggest that such was indeed the usual method and it remains so and the guardians have bestowed upon the chosen ones that great rationale for such godplaying exercisesvalues and culture the chosen ones have acceptedfor better or for worse the values of the guardian and they have no other choice short of abdicating their curious status and the products of this tormenting marriage both the chosen ones and the guardian have the unadulterated arrogance to subject the fellah to those values in a manner that is perhaps without precedent as one mans brazen declaration of superiority over another year after year after year they persist with inimitable audacity in demanding that the fellah respect uphold and keep sacred those dubious values which have to this date in this land served the fellahs interest not one damn bit the result of this vile web the condition of american life today that which all the surveys are about rather compels one to search and search for a rationale that will deem the guardian and the chosen ones something other than the most merciless duo to ever inhabit the earth but the web is so full of lies and the search alas is in vain moreover the accusersthose who deny the fellahs humanity by condemning him for the sins they have committed against him claim the right to their vicious undertaking they have manipulated the teachings of their high class churches so as to defendtheir incredible impositions and judgments on the grounds of a strange barren morality but it is no secret that they are not half as vehement in their efforts to make of themselves and their values something worth respecting the distorted nature of their morality can be witnessed for example in their pretentious inability throughout americas citiesto persecute slum landlords with the same tenacious will that they have employed all these years in their persecution of the very people whose stench degradation and deaths will forever haunt the souls of those same landlords this is but one example of the horror of the american double standard that one might depict ad infinitum and such is the noble status of the sons and daughters of the chosen ones and the guardian and the fellah is hep to them and they know it but the chosen ones cloak their guilt with all the affectations of the catalogue culture and its peculiar dignity what is more american than mail order houses and catalogues you see it you want it you order it its yours you have a lifetime to pay for it and in all probability it isnt worth a damn but everyone has one so so it is the same with the culture that is valued by the chosen ones who have received from the guardian with his blessings the catalogue which carries with it the right to order those things deemed necessary by the guardian to insure complete control of the chosen ones anyone given the opportunity can grasp all that jazz that is at once a claim to fame and the source most often used to deny the fellahs humanity it is just as easy as that it is nothing more than a catalogue culture all one really needs is the catalogue but the cultured ones have not yet proved that they have the basic decencyin spite of brotherhood weekto share the catalogue with the fellah a fact which implies that they are somehow terribly afraid that the fellah might pass the course in six easy lessons quite like they did before him and no longer would the chosen ones and the guardian loom so mighty in their timid makebelieve minds for as fanon so wisely observed the fellah is the truthabout the rest of us if we are fortunate the nature of love and hate being so entwined perhaps the fellah will eventually save us from ourselves to expect the fellah to join this fraternity of hypocrisy and selfdeception at this late date is to believe in miracles this dreary coalition has conspired to starve men and has sealed the conspiracy with faith hope charity good intentions and a yet unfound democracy but time has worked against us and caught us naked for the masses of victims to joinnowwould be to defy human nature fanon suggested come then comrades we must find something different and the fellah willit is only a matter of time but what hope is there for the chosen ones and the guardian perhaps the starting point is to look at ourselves to finally question our existence in another country through the voice of the preacher sermonizing over the dead rufus a suicide victim james baldwin spoke profoundly and i tell you something else dont none of you forget it i know a lot of people done took their own lives and theyre walking up and down the streets today and some of them is preaching the gospel and some is sitting in the seats of the mighty now you remember that if the world wasnt so full of dead folks maybe those of us thats trying to live wouldnt have to suffer so bad and he was notwhen he spoke of dead folkstalking about the fellah the negroes around parisespecially the younger more swinging oneshave found a new sport which like bullfighting is often bloody and more than a little cruel theres an american governmental employee around town who everyone assumes is an agent of the cia central intelligence agency the man makes himself known to all the brothers and proceeds to feel them out relative to their opinions on say vietnam and santo domingo and the race war back home not only that but he asks for all the details of personal life and history such as place of birth university attended etc and it is difficult not to imagine him scurrying back to his apartment to write all this information in his dossiers after a session with some particularly effusive subject well the negroes just put him on something awful they tell him all kinds of wild things and sometimes they sound like theyre ready to take up arms and fight against la patrie the government man offers all kinds of reasons why america is not so badthings are so much better than they were or many white people are now helping the negroes or negroes have more cars and refrigerators than all the french peopleand he always seems genuinely surprised that no negro agrees with him and when he is asked about all the violence and discrimination directed against negroes at home the government mans standard reply goes something like this well its better than russia you can still try to change things in america but you cant change things in russia but who said anything about russia well its there in the back of the government mans head and out it comes russia communism china but baby you dont have to worry about communism so much if you make democracy work one refugee from the civil_rights wars told the government man but it didnt sink in nothing seems to sink in really the government man just keeps going from negro to negro collecting his data and being put on and nothing changes the mans ego must be shielded by a tough armor of patriotism not to be ripped to shreds by all the subtle ridicule and hostility he encounters but alas perhaps the bearing of such a burden was an important aspect of his training in intelligence out of simple humanity one hopes so his is a totally unrewarding job for all that information on the dossiers wont change a single fact about racism in america and its destructive effect on black americans at a recent los angeles conference cosponsored by the american textbook publishers institute and the great cities research council the major subject of discussion was the representation or lack of same of racial and ethnic minorities in the textbooks used in urban education dr evelyn f carlson associate superintendent of the chicago public schools had this to say the materials available now are fine and tremendous the publishers have come a long way dr everett chaffee associate superintendent of the los angeles public schools contributed the following five years ago we were critical now were aware of the lead time publishers need in the past year or year and onehalf material has come on the market dealing with these issues of racial and minority groups im not so worried about this area right now this in spite of evidence to the contrary in a recent saturday review article the allwhite world of childrens books nancy larrick former president of the international reading association stated across the country nonwhite children are learning to read and to understand the american way of life in books which either omit them entirely or scarcely mention them there is no need to elaborate upon the damagemuch of it irreparableto the negro childs personality it is no secret that chicago lags far behind other large cities in making progress in this area also we are laboring under the assumption that watts is a part of los angeles with this in mind we cant help wondering who the two educators propose to represent when they claim that things are fine and tremendous and there is no cause to worry it was at the breakfast table in messel a quiet german village near darmstadt that we read the report on last aprils writers conference at the new school in new york in the latest issue of the new school bulletin it first had been published in a japanese review was reprinted in the bulletin and the copy at hand had been mailed to our german host from new york by its author gloria oden an american negro poeteditorlawyer our first reaction to the report was one of sadness not merely because we had seen the writers conference differently in conception and effect but also because we felt the author did not understand the banality and futility of her propositionthat for all practical purposes she was at least a generation behind the times for she was critical of the negro writers at the conference for their refusal to seize the opportunity of a receptive predominantly white audience to seek to persuade them to the writers cause she saw the chance for the establishment of a dialogue and she felt the negro writers had turned their backs had instead resorted to complaints accusations and emotionalism and she proposed that ideally the negro writers should have adopted a more conciliatory pose one has to grant miss oden the possession of seriousness and concern these values at least she shares with the writers she opposes she wishes that the idea of race which divides americans would cease to exist as a problem and she apparently feels that negro writers can help in diminishing the problem by ceasing to emphasize their differences miss oden admits the catalogue of wrongs the negro people endure at the hands of their white compatriots but she would make much of the fact that negro writers and intellectuals spring from a class less affected by these wrongs and she suggests that these writers and intellectuals also have the duty to confront the significance of their privileged status she seems to be reminding the creators of the angry and bitter black characters in recent novels and plays by negroes that there also exist happy black millionaires and even lawyers editors and scientists with life patterns which do not conform to those depicted in the novels and plays it is an argument as tragically shortsighted and ultimately irrelevant as it is old the house slave always emphasized his superiority over the field slave without altering one iota the reality of his condition the paper bag negro elites assumed high caste and social standing without ever losing the stigma or evading the limitations imposed by in irving chapmans novel the man there is a negro writer named leroy who begins each day with an exercise in hating whites at the end of his novel the system of dantes hell grove press leroi jones says if we can bring back on ourselves the absolute pain our people must have felt when they came onto this shore we are more ourselves again and can put history back in our menu and forget the propaganda of devils that they are not devils in this book leroi jones brings back the pain of childhood and youth in chapters which are supposed to correspond to the circles of dantes hell where sinners are tormented for their sins jones prose does not have the sinewy clear terse direct quality of dantes verse the scenes in some of his chapters do not correspond to the sins of those in the matching circles of dantes hell the early chapters are fragmentary they contain random disconnected memories of childhood these may be interesting to a psychiatrist but not to a reader of a novel looking for a story who is not concerned with administering therapy or with interpreting free associations the corner is old headlight bubbles now look for the lies them now they go away these lovers for my running those soft flies over the shortstops head please not as a dead man even diane a fair second baseman you let him die no the lies no the later chapters have more narration they tell of a gang fight at a party an attempted massrape of a syphilitic prostitute the seduction of a boy by his army buddy and his rape by his tent mates and the seduction of the boy by a prostitute in a southern town when you consider the chief character you find that he doesnt have it so bad he

with his poets skill with words that leroi jones creates the atmosphere of hell in spite of some faddish eccentricities of style punctuation and spelling which he would do well to discard i dont think there is a single cliche in the book jones achieves this depressing atmosphere with his images of stinks greyness ugliness with his broken sentences his stumbling rhythms gone is the innocence of tom sawyer and huckleberry finn innocence despite the come back to the raft huck honey of leslie fiedler who hysterical as a member of the john birch society sees a homosexual or an oversexed negro under every bed the book that this most calls to mind is jean toomers cane both books were written by poets in an evocative style but the mood is different cane has the joy of discovery of the peasant soil of the south and bursts forth into wonderful poems joness book has a malaise of the urban north and abounds with references to copulation masturbation and fellatio this is a minor work of a talented writer he will do better when he grows more mature harlem is the most surveyed researched storied chronicled and publicized neighborhood in the world yet each year we see a new stream of books articles pamphlets and newsprint coming from that ghetto of color perched atop manhattan the reason for this and the continued interest in harlem is because no one book or collection of books has been able to arrive at a definitive work on harlem gibbons rise and fall of the roman empire did this for a phenomenon as great and as geographically diverse as rome but no one has been able to approach anything similar for harlem perhaps the reason for this is found in the very fact that harlemwhat it is and representsutterly defies definition perhaps harlem is like fire we know what elements go into making it we know what conditions exist to make its existence possible we know the effects it can have and the things it can do to and for people but we do not know what it is in substance any book that uses harlem as a background or point of departure is already limited from the outset to capturing just a small portion of the essence of harlem harlem is every conceivable thing to every conceivable mentality this is not an original idea regarding cities but in harlem its true in spades pun intended bird at my window lippincott philadelphia is a very sensitive engaging challenging novel by rosa guy it reveals the gradual amoralization of a black man in harlem in doing so miss guy demonstrates an enviable skill in relating the sociological and psychological forces that cause this phenomenon because she does so without preaching or philosophizing equally skillful is the subtle manner she employs to get her points across to the reader it helps if the reader knows harlem however it is essential that the reader know negro ghetto life to get the full understanding and appreciate the real talent gently at work here miss guy does not tell us anything new about harlem that is not her mission what she does is to relate an interesting story and the psychological metamorphosis of a black man in harlem caught up in the matriarchy mores and manipulation common to black america the book for all of its positive values does suffer in several aspects the dialogues sometimes fail to ring true unlikely and falsesounding words and phrases come out of very unlikely mouths at times the book lags but that might be attributed to the impatience of the reader to get on which is something of an indirect compliment to the author with bird at my window we can score another triumph for harlem harlem has produced a continuum of talent dating back to the times before the black renaissance of the twenties for despite the poverty horror and shame harlem stands for the chain of talented writers has been unbroken from hughes through wright baldwin and claude brown miss guy is on the threshold of adding another link to that impressive chainbrooks johnson i when the united states sent marines into the dominican republic last spring did it act out of selfish interest and against the people of that country most people who answer yes to that question are called radical and

republic and a candid account of our involvement there the pure barbarism of trujillo the latin american hitleris displayed as well as the undeniable fact that we supported him for years the author describes young rebels in the dominican republic as militantly nationalist and fervently antiamerican with the restlessness and dissatisfaction that characterize youth in most underdeveloped countries scarred by past colonial or totalitarian exploitation and the author has seen most such countries but why this antiamericanism what kind of government or family did we support under trujillo there was the mass murder of to haitian residentsno one is certain of the figureduring one hour period in trujillo with our support managed to obtain control of more than of the nations wealth with the remainder going to a handful of partners in his crimes while the populace suffered the trujillo family ended up owning of the nations sugar plantations of its sugar mills of its best land and compiled a fortune estimated at over million the tortures used against his foes and anyone who thought he was less than god was an enemyincluded nail extractors decapitation collars leather thonged whips and various electrical devices but as author kurzman points out trujillo was a good friend of the united states after all he paid off his countrys foreign debts always voted the right way in the oas and un kept the streets clean put communists in jail and knew how to keep order in a country that was not ready for democracy juan bosch the man who was overthrown while bringing democracy to the dominican republicdefeated because we refused to help himalso comes through in this book he comes through as a man with many political shortcomings but nevertheless as a man who believed in democracy and was dedicated to his people author kurzman assesses boschs failures but history will be hard pressed to find one greater than his belief and trust in the united states one cannot neglect the history of the dominican republic and expect to understand the situation in that country today author kurzman in this excellently written and well documerited book brings the truth before our eyes he proves that one can be anticommunism and antiadministration policy although there are those who would find that inconceivable it is noteworthy that the author mentions that most of the poor oppressed persecuted victims of tyranny in the dominican republic just happen to belong to the darker race the author would prefer and this is his right to think that our policy in the dominican republic has been a case of blundering but how long can such blundering persist it is left to the readers subjective conclusion whether we are really so blundering or maybe as history rather suggests we are just plain antipeople especially certain peopledavid llorens aristotle called him a madman plato thought he was indeed a thing ethereally lightwinged and sacred the dark ages looked upon him as supernatural and primitive cultures even today regard him with an awe reserved for the gods whatever he was in the past however the artist today is certainly one of the least defined members of society whether writer musician painter sculptor actor director choreographer or related practitioner the artistically inclined person is a strange bird indeed in a world committed to functionalism in a new clinical study the artist in society problems and treatment of the creative personality grove press psychiatrist lawrence j hatterer presents a longneeded analysis of this grossly misunderstood minority because of his work way of life and status in society writes the author the artist has problems peculiar to himself unlike those whose work is not closely bound up with their inner life an artists emotional experience is central to his achievement dr hatterer who has analyzed thousands of artistpatients over the last seven years confines his discussion to those problems distinguishing artists from other patients these include the artistic ego professional rejection creative work blocks fallow periods the need for isolation and consequent loss of meaningful relationships resentments stemming from nonrecognition both by the public and intimates lack of a concrete occupational identity conflict in values with the outside world and others in addition the study clears up some of the timeworn stereotypes regarding the artist including the spurious assumption perpetuated by romantic biographies that creative impulse and mental derangement are one and the same clinical evidence does not support the linkage of genius with insanity dr hatterer asserts rather such evidence contradicts this because in psychosis the artists work is severely impaired however the book does often seem to imply that most artists away from their work have difficulty functioning in society from what we know of the lives of dante shakespeare bach haydn and others as well as latterday artists in all fields it is evident that the human mind can somehow operate both superficially and in those strange trackless regions where art lives there must come a time in the creative sensibility when the world around it seems shallow indeed but most geniuses seem able to descend again and take part in that world often in its most banal pursuits indeed the creative instinct it seems to me defies analysis its very existence implies the nonrational the mystic still for practicing therapists not oriented in the psyche of the artist the book will doubtless prove enlightening for artists themselves it will certainly be of therapeutic valuehamilton bims every historical event has a very vital causal connection with the past such a historic event is the culmination of a series of pertinent factors that have preceded the actual event in question to fully understand the occurrence we must know what the pertinent facts are behind and before the occurrence itself the entering of james meredith into the university of mississippi is probably one of the most completely covered and documented of modern events certainly no other college activity has ever received such publicity andor notoriety so any book that merely rakes over these old coals is not really likely to make much of a contribution but walter lords the past that would not die harper and row discusses merediths entrance into ole miss and does make a contribution the reason for this is that he has gone deep into mississippi history and provided us with sociological economical and political facts that directly relate to what happened in oxford during those historic days to this extent he provides the reader with background information to better understand the factors and forces at work there this is the second of two books i have read inspired by merediths enrollment at ole miss the other james silvers mississippi the closed society was also quite heavy in historic background and as a result things that previously were vague and void of meaning took on clarity as a result of reading the book lords book is similar in what it does but he does extend ones understanding of mississippi history a bit differently from silver but putting this aside another area in which the book makes a rather clean incisive and definitive point is the manner in which it dispenses with the old idea that time takes care of everything the idea in question can be posed if mississippi and the south had had more time would they have gradually corrected their own problems mr lord provides us with almost indisputable evidence to the contrary for example he points out that things of the south have not really changed much since civil war days the following is a quote from about mississippi the respectable people of the state do not discourage the practice of carrying arms by whites as they should they are astonishingly tolerant of acts which would arouse a northern community to the utmost a willingness to see men take the law into their own hands and what is still worse to let them openly defy the laws without losing apparently the respect of the community but lord does not rely upon the fact that the quote in question could have just as easily been made in he goes on to statistically make his point the trouble was more time all too often meant that the negro simply drifted further back when mississippi tightened its voting qualifications in it was argued that negroes were not ready since were illiterate by less than were illiterate but fewer negroes than ever were allowed to register and further nor did more time mean more money for negro education in negro teachers average a month in the figure was moreover we find that in the state of mississippi spent three times as much on white education as for negroes in the ratio was the same so we clearly see that in mississippi separate never was equal and there never was any intention on the part of white mississippians that it should be that way the book is very engaging and informative it is written in a very easy readable style with each point put forth realistically and scholarly supported the meat is in the factual and statistical presentation of facets of mississippi history that shed light and meaning on mississippi today and the fact that they are almost hopelessly chained to the past that would not die back in antiquity there was a saying that is still very much with us today the saying is render unto caesar that which is caesars and render unto god that which is gods this was a tacit assumption of that fact that there was to be a split between the secular and spiritual realms politicians were to minister to the secular realm and churchmen to the spiritual realm even then there were great conflicts between politician and pope the two swords doctrine manifested in the above quote which was a source of conflict down through the ages still lingers with us of late it is demonstrated in the conflict that goes on within the minds and souls of religious leaders today in the area of civil_rights just how much should a clergyman concern himself with the secular movement of negroes into the street to protest how involved should be get in the basic mundane struggle of black people to leave the ghetto and throw off their ghettorization for negro ministers this has often proven to be a thorny question with no fast and sure answer for many white ministers it has proven to be a question that they have refused to meet head on and have attempted to ignore it whenever and wherever possible but there is a discernible change in their reaction to the civil_rights movements more and more white ministers are coming to the front lines some assuming roles of leaders but david reimers white protestantism and the negro oxford university press is not so much concerned with what the various white christian leaders are doing but rather my purpose is to provide the historical perspective for viewing what they are doing it is perhaps too shopworn to repeat that the most segregated hour in america is sunday morning from eleven to twelve when america is worshipping this is a very provocative and pitiful paradox mr reimers book does help to understand how this blightful fact got to be such understanding the background does not of course cure the ailment but it does provide us with a basis for making intelligent diagnosis and the ultimate application of preventive measures to this end mr reimers book furnishes us with a valuable piece of literature it is perhaps necessarily incomplete because this is not the kind of subject that lends itself to a definitive treatment it is easy and intelligible reading and will give the reader certain historical insights into whys and hows of american white christianity and its relationship to american black people this is what the author sets out to do and after some pages you get the impression that he has succeeded cathedrals of france beacon press has as its illustratorauthor auguste rodin it is a handsome giftoriented englishlanguage edition of a book first published in france in the text and drawings in the page book with an index of place names were taken from the notebook of the famed sculptorarchitect who apparently was fascinated by cathedrals and received inspiration from studying them the great mans descriptions reflections and impressions are enthralling and translator elisabeth c geissbuhle has captured the nuances and flavor of a fine witty and deeply humane intellect in the note to the original french edition the publishers presented rodins writing and sketches as uniquely the work of an artist that we present to the public of an artist whose sense of beauty none will contest no attempt was made to reorganize the artists musings to place them in some order he had not himself devised the dozens of renderings are scattered throughout the book one set of wellknown edifices grouped into a portfolio in the center of the book the writing is often poetically evocative i am one of the last witnesses of a dying art the love that inspired it is spent the marvels of the past slip into oblivion nothing replaces them and soon we shall be in the night frenchmen are hostile to the treasures of beauty that glorify their race and with no one to guard these treasures they strike them they break them out of hatred or ignorance or by stupidity or under pretext of restoring they dishonor them those who like rodin love the inspired architecture represented by some of the old cathedrals of europe will want to see and readand keepcathedrals of france the awakenings of africa are numerous and many are lost with that part of history that is conveniently listed as unrecorded it is refreshing to read a book that makes an admirable attempt at recording parts of the more recent political awakening of africa rupert emerson and martin kilson have coedited an interesting book entitled the political awakening of africa prenticehall new jersey the method of chronicling this more recent awakening is to collect the speeches of some of africas leading nationalists and leaders starting back with j e casely hayford and felix eboue and their special brand of nationalism and continuing down to more current leaders and their brand of african political nationalism the book is outstanding for what is included and the light that it sheds on the basic thinking of african leaders some years ago the book points to the former african desire to better conditions within the existing framework of political domination by for eign powers the goal of these early leaders was to convince the ruling powers that the african was worthy of better treatment on one hand and to make the african more deserving and faithful to the colonial country on the other as stated above the book is impressive for what it says but it is also impressive because it does not say as much as one would like hearing the leaders of africa past and present talk about african political problems is a very enlightening and realistic method of understanding what the african thinking and goals really were and the methodology they sought to employ to realize these ends the amount of literary and intellectual salt the reader has to apply to get a full understanding is correspondingly reduced when the subject matter is presented in this fashion the upshot of all this is that one is impressed with what is said and how but really wishes that the authors had given us more while the old theatre axiom always leaving wanting more is good theatre technique the result of the same feeling here is that the reader is left partially pleased but generally frustratedbrooks johnson chester himes the heats on putnams and sons new york tells of the havoc that a misplaced cache of heroin in harlem can cause to do this he uses addicttypes with their full complement of supportive characters sometimes these characters come off and sometimes they dont but himes does manage to keep an element of suspense in the story right up to the very last page he is extremely successful in his attempts at humor this is perhaps the very strong point of the book humor is generally a visual experience and to elicit the kind of humorous response he gets from his use of the printed word demonstrates truly a marvelous talent unfortunately that talent does not obliterate the shortcomings in things such as dialogue and feel the reader is left with the feeling that mr himes would have been better off to have returned to harlem to restudy some of the patterns and vernacular that now are in vogue rather than depending on his memory for things about harlem that were true before he left there for residence in paris harlem is elusive because it is constantly changing and to capture even a minute part one must have uptodate firsthand contact it is easy to discover the fact that mr himes is a talented writer but it is equally apparent that the talent was not uniformly applied in places and things that required extensive hard work we find the author apparently settling for less than his native abilities could produce perhaps if harlem were not so well known to us the book would have been more palatable and believable but the harlem of mr himes does not come off with the reality we have seen in person and read about in the works of some others who strangely enough did not generally appear to have the basic talent that mr himes possesses in his book mr himes fails twice he fails himself and what he is no doubt capable of and he fails harlembrooks johnson chicagos weather report predicted clear skies and a high in the s earlier that same group of visiting french saluted their flag as they proudly paraded in front of chicagos busy city hall the city fathers beamed with pride lake michigan sent a gush of cool air along the parade route it was indeed a most clear and promising july th by early

richard j daley was attending the nd annual national league of cities convention in detroit four cars of angry chicagoans had left earlier to picket his honor it was not quite certain when daly planned to return home dr_king vowed to return again comedians may jest politicians may orate and harried taxpayers may fumebut income taxes are a necessary part of our economic structure income taxes were first imposed in as an emergency measure to meet the expenditures of the civil war repealed in and revived in income taxes left the american scene when declared unconstitutional in the sixteenth amendment to the constitution enacted into law on february gave congress the power to levy and collect taxes on income from all sources without equal apportionment between the states or apportionment based on any census considered a model among tax systems the american tax system has a reputation of being one of the most effective and strongest systems anywhere in the world what is quite unique in our system is that almost billion is collected each year with approximately being collected on a voluntary basis this is the result of the selfassessment system whereby taxpayers in good faith assess themsplves by listing income and deductions and compute tax liability many taxpayers are resentful of the taxbite but by and large people are cognizant of the fact that most countriesboth of the eastern and western blocshave income taxes at higher rates than our own to complain to disagree to petition and to want taxes abolished altogether are an american institution what these antitax proponents know deep down in their hearts is that our system of government could not continue without the revenue derived from income and excise taxes inequities exist in anything human and congressional tax experts are aware that our tax laws are replete with loopholes and opportunities for special interests to pay less than their true share of the tax burden however studies by tax counsellors who work for the nations lawmakers are constantly underway the introduction of electronic data processing is expected to curb the deliberate omissions of taxable dividends interest and other items and to keep a check on dependency exemptions and allowable deductions at times it may not seem to be a privilege to pay taxes without waving the flag realization is a must that the annual federal tax bill is but a small price to pay to be able to live in a nation which has a constitution which embodies so many protections for the rights of its citizens while the treasury department through the internal revenue service wants you to pay your true and full tax liability it does not want you to overpay many taxpayers overpay their taxesunnecessarily or fail to receive refunds for previous overpayments because of faulty penmanship beware of deceiving digits consider the errors that can occur in computing your tax or filling in your forms if your ls s and s all look alike if your s and s appear to be interchangeable if your s and s cannot be told apart illegible numerals are not the only troublemakers each year hundreds of thousands of tax refunds are delayed in reaching claimants because internal revenue clerks cannot decipher names of individuals streets or cities failure to notify the district directors office of a change of address also results in delayed checks and unnecessary correspondence because by law the post office department cannot forward an envelope containing a government check you can save yourself a lot of grief if you approach the preparation of your tax return in an orderly fashion also tax time can be very costly if you neglect to keep a record of deductible expense and wait until the last minute to work on your return and in your haste overlook legitimate deductions on one sheet of paper list the figures from your w forms together with all other sources of income such as fees commissions profits from real estate profits from stocks dividends interest etc make sure that you do not include nontaxable income such as loans gifts compensation insurance proceeds insurance recoveries for injury or sickness etc on another piece of paper list your tax deductible expensescontributions interest casualty losses taxes medical expenses and miscellaneous items now it is time to make a decision which return should you use which method of filing will give you the lower tax to pay or the greater refund if your gross income is or less you can elect to use the tax tables even though you make this election you can still deduct local carfares travel away from home expenses including the cost of meals and lodging which are necessary to your employment when your deductible expenses exceed of your gross income it will pay you to make the election to itemize your deductions on what is known as the longform where your income is over you can elect the standard optional deduction limited to you can list your itemized deductions for taxes interest charity etc or you can elect to use the minimum standard deduction frequently taxpayers will see published tables of average deductions and assume that their returns will not be questioned if what they claim is within the guidelines nothing could be more erroneous a taxpayer can only deduct that amount actually spent which is substantiated by receipted bills or cancelled checks the first draft of the return should be put away for a few days thereafter the return in draft form should be examined for omissions of income or deductible items the return should be checked for mathematical accuracy a clean handwritten or typed copy should be prepared for submission to the treasury department to this copy should be attached copy b of form w together with all schedules necessary to support deductions claimed on the return tax laws are complicated and often beyond the comprehension of the layman knowing this phony tax experts open up shops in candy stores barber shops poolrooms gas stations vacant stores etc during tax time each year some yearend tax preparers are fully capable while many others are either ignorant of the tax laws or are downright crooked several years ago a new york city newspaper tested the accuracy of these flybynight establishments and sent reporters with a set of hypothetical figures to five different taxseason experts the result was five different sets of answers yet despite warnings each year from governmental authorities and professional groups countless persons fall prey to these phony tax consultants usually the lure is that theyll get you a refund maybe so but you the taxpayer must pay the piper if your figures for deductions which you can actually substantiate are doctored and stretched in order to get you the refund the internal revenue service recently issued information concerning the arrest and conviction of rings which consisted of these illicit operators and internal revenue service personnel one a pennsylvanian asked his clients to sign blank returns and to make their tax payment check to his order he then falsely increased deductions and paid a reduced tax and pocketed the difference in addition to a yearandaday prison sentence he was placed on probation for three years during which time he cannot prepare any returns other than his own a parttime salesman convinced many persons that the w form was the full tax return he then prepared false returns containing exaggerated deductions and listed nonexistent dependents signed the return himself and after receiving the refund checks forged the endorsements and pocketed the refunds still another induced his customers to sign forms authorizing the government to mail the refund checks to his order unaware of the actual amount of their refunds as they never saw the copy filed with the revenue service the taxpayers accepted the amounts tendered while the tax consultant pocketed the difference under existing laws and regulations a taxpayer is responsible for the accuracy of his tax return and can face both civil and criminal penalties for the filing of a false return how can you protect yourself against this racket in any part of the country you can find a qualified lawyer or accountant who regularly does tax work what you have to keep in mind is that anyone who wants to can under existing law designate himself as a tax expert it is a safe guess that there is at least one crooked expertand probably morein every community and he can get as many as a thousand innocent taxpayers into serious trouble with the government so watch out the internal revenue service has recently issued a list of suggestions to taxpayers who are seeking assistance in the preparation of their returns be sure of the competence and integrity of a prospective tax advisor consult the better business bureau or similar organization if no other references are available be sure the tax advisor has a permanent place of business where he can be reached in case the internal revenue service subsequently questions data on the return except where absolutely necessary do not sign a powerofattorney form always insist that refund checks come to you not the consultant never sign a blank return you are fully responsible for everything appearing on your return beware of those whose stock in trade is their claim of ability to obtain large refunds be especially careful of those who ask for a fee based on the amount to be refunded steer clear of any advisor who suggests claiming dependencies or other deductions to which you are not entitled participation in such a scheme may result in serious criminal and civil penalties cooperate with the government by reporting any suspicious actions by practitioners or any evidence of unethical or fraudulent practices your information will be held in confidence to these we might add the following a insist that your advisor be a licensed lawyer licensed accountant or person who is enrolled to practice before the treasury department lawyers and cpas are automatically enrolled others have to pass a rigid test to see if they know the tax law b examine your return before signing it make sure no incorrect items are listed accidentally or otherwise c when you owe money insist on making your check payable to the district director of internal revenue or to the internal revenue service mail your return yourself d be very cautious with advisors who claim that they can save you money in comparison with what you have paid in the past perhaps the best advice you can get in connection with your yearend tax problem is to stop looking for bargains a competent tax advisor will usually charge a fee based on the complexity of the return or the amount of detail involved but the fee if larger than that charged by the flybynight operator will be in line with that charged by other ethical professional tax men every return filed is checked for mathematical accuracy by a comptometer operator thereafter trained auditors scan each return for items of obvious error and for items of unusual nature you may receive tentative approval or you may receive a letter directing you to appear at the local office of the district director with proof of certain items claimed on your return your first thought when receiving a communication is why me the treasury department takes a second look at returns which contain large or unusual deductions where claim is made for large refunds where items are not fully explained where abnormally large deductions are claimed in relation to income all returns which have gross income of a certain figure are checked all business returns of a certain gross sales volume are checked the limits set each year by high officials in the treasury department these figures are not released to the public and are circulated to internal revenue service personnel only the treasury department has many sources of information available to it to ascertain that you are reporting all sources of taxable income your employer is required to file form w showing any wages paid to you any person firm or organization paying you or more in compensation fees commissions rents etc is required to forward such information on form any payor of dividends or interest of or more is also required to report such payments on form banks are required to report any unusual currency transactions in your account treasury agents keep a close check on county clerk offices to observe purchases of real estate they keep a close watch at race tracks and other places where large amounts of cash are spent they read divorce proceedings and separation suits where financial data is exposed they read newspaper accounts of robberies involving cash and jewelry a constant check is kept on prizes and awards given on television programs and in nationwide contests or sweepstakes no doubt youve read about adp automatic data processing is being used by the government to establish a history of each taxpayer on magnetic tape reports of dividend interest and other payments will be fed into the input and made part of the individual history comparison will be made with the return as filed and electronically the machine will punch out cards to alert the treasury department to failures to report taxable income another source of information is the informer our government checks letters sent to it by persons bearing a grudge who reveal information about taxpayers a jilted girl friend a jealous neighbor a disgruntled exemployee a dissatisfied present employee are but a few sources of squeal information to encourage this practice the government pays awards to informers based on the amount of the tax and penalty recovered and the amount of help received in the information furnished many congressmen are disenchanted with any system which encourages one person to spy on another and attempts have been made and at this writing are being made to suspend the system of making payments to informers what do you do when you are called for examination if you had your return prepared by a taxattorney or by an accountant it is best to let him handle the audit professional tax practitioners are better equipped to handle this matter and are less apt to put their foot into their mouths as you might do when representing yourself should you have someone representing you it is the best policy to cooperate fully by revealing complete facts regarding the items shown on your return locate all supporting evidence cancelled checks receipts etc and give these to the person whom you picked to represent you a word of caution where you were foolish enough to have your return prepared by one of the phony operators discussed previously it is best to represent yourself or secure a competent person to assume the responsibility of conducting the audit representing yourself call at the office at the time designated or if you cant keep the appointment call in advance and ask for a change to a more suitable date how are you to act the first rule is not to be offensive remember that the examining officer or revenue agent is only doing his or her job let the agent do the talking and let him tell you exactly what items are being questioned where you are asked to produce proof of a deduction taken on the return show the receipted bill or cancelled checks and if the agent is not satisfied offer to get additional information keep in mind that the audit does not have to be completed in that one visit you can ask for and youll readily get an opportunity to produce substantiating evidence to support your claim deductions where you can prove most of your deduction but not to the last penny the agent will most likely give you the benefit of the doubt if you have been agreeable cooperative and in a position to prove most of your deductions by evidencenot by oral argument when the agent reveals that he has information of income which is not disclosed on your return and you omitted such income based on your honest belief that such item is not taxable income show what evidence you can that such omission is based on law not just a desire to avoid paying taxes the agent will probably have on his desk a copy of one of the private tax services such as prentice hall or commerce clearing house and hell be glad to check in these volumes if you give a quote or section number to support your argument each proposed disallowance of deduction that you claimed and each proposed addition to taxable income will be discussed with you before the agent writes his report where you agree to the changes he will write his report and ask you to sign a form wherein you agree to the charges and waive your right to take the matter to the tax court where you subsequently find that you were wrong in signing such form you can sue in the federal district court or in the court of claims to recover the taxes you paid butsuppose you dont agree with the changes that the agent proposes then you dont have to sign anything you thank him for his courtesy and ask him to send you a notice of the proposed changes from this point on you are dueling with the government but you have many many powerful forces on your side before the treasury department can issue an assessment and force you to pay additional taxes when you indicate that you do not agree to the proposed changes the agent will send you a letter stating the proposed changes and will arrange a conference with his group chief at this conference you will be given an opportunity to discuss the findings and to dispute them and show why you think your return as filed was correct should you not reach an agreement at this conference you will receive a copy of the agents report together with what is known as the day letter this letter gives you three courses of action you can execute form which will be enclosed agreeing to the agents determinations and thus closing the case or you can file a formal protest setting forth the pertinent facts why you think you are right this is filed with the district director of internal revenue the appeal is referred to the appellate division you can ignore the day letter and wait for the government to send you what is known as a day letter which is a statutory notice when you file a formal protest after the receipt of the day letter another conference is arranged this time with conferees in the appellate division an informal atmosphere prevails at these conferences no stenographer is present and you or your designated agent are given the opportunity to offer either written or oral evidence to refute the agents contentions every attempt will be made to reach an agreement and not have the case reach an impasse where you cannot reach agreement and a closing form is not executed you will receive the day letter which is statutory notice of the governments intention to issue an assessment against you the day letter will inform you that unless you decide to agree to the assessment as proposed you must make a petition to the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency if you dont petition the tax court you will lose by forfeit and the government can levy its assessment but if you do ask the tax court to docket your case for a hearing the government cannot collect or levy an assessment except in very unusual cases where there is reason to believe that collection would be endangered by delay all during the period of waiting for your case to be heard by the tax court the opportunity is given you to settle your case conferences are granted to iron out differences of opinion and to effect compromises at the hearing before the tax court every avenue of justice is available to the taxpayer the court may decide for either the taxpayer or for the government or may decide that the issue is one that just requires a recomputation of tax liability after defining some points in either sides favor where a taxpayer loses a case in the tax court he may post a bond to cover the amount of the tax and take the case to the court of appeals and even to the u s supreme court this is one very unfortunate situation with relation to tax court decisions you might have a case which is exactly like another one to the last dotted i yet the same issue will be brought up by the government in an audit of your return this is because the commissioner of internal revenue can acquiesce or not acquiesce to any given decision if the commissioner does not acquiesce in an adverse decision each taxpayer must argue the same issue many congressmen are alarmed over this situation and have proposed that the commissioner in the event of a nonacquiescence must take the case on appeal to a higher court so that the issue is resolved one way or the other the same situation prevails in the event that you elected to bypass the tax court in this event you would have had to pay the tax deficiency and sue for a refund if the district director did not honor your claim for a refund presented on form again you have an opportunity for conferences before the case is tried in the court of claims or in the district court appeals from both can be made to the u s supreme court the trouble with district court cases is that the same issue can be settled with different results in different districts the district courts are free to ignore decisions of other districts here again congressmen are trying to convince the commissioner that where different decisions are given to a similar set of facts in different districts that the case be taken on appeal automatically to the u s supreme court for final adjudication the entire system of our tax laws is designed so that the administration of these laws is consistent with the principles of american fair play and justice as emphasized mistakes are made laws may seem unreasonable and tax time may be unwelcome but it is a reminder that the costs of freedom come high i never will forget that day in early september about dusk when dick came home from work on aubrey bradleys farm raving about tea ice we hired outdick and me to the farmers around in our vicinity of the hocking valley whenever we could get a days work the week before we had worked every day for jim chevaliar the harelip township trustee putting up loose hay aubrey bradley baled his hay it sure was heavier that way when he used the little baler those bundles came out weighing about sixty or seventy pounds when he used the new baling machine they weighed ninety or a hundred that was almost moren i weighed i was getting ready to graduate from high school next term and ever since id been there i had tried everything i could think of to get the scales up past a hundredun twenty i guess thats why aubrey bradley asked for dick to come to work that early monday morning in september when he drove out to our house and stopped so fast the dust and gravel caught up with his red pickup truck when he skidded to a fishtail halt in the winter a farmer could take his time but in the summer he had to hustle to make hay while the sun shined not only is farming fast work but its back breaking which as i said is why aubrey bradley hired dick that morning and not me dick was sixteen a year youngern me but he was twice as sturdy and he was as strong as a young white oak tree i was more like a softwood maple i would hold together but a topheavy load could send me sagging before that summer before jim chevaliar hired dick and me to set fence posts and then to put up hay when the haying season cameneither of us had learned much about farming our family owned one of the largest pieces of land in that part of the valley one hundred acres but it was all grown over with underbrush grandpa had never really intended to farm it when he bought it oh he said he wanted the boys my unclesto farm it and he even bought a couple of horses and a cow but hehimselfwas not a farmer he was a city factory worker who moved to the country to have room for his family his sonsmy unclesfollowed in his footsteps they tried to farm at first but somehow everyone else was always harvesting by the time the boys finished plowing the rolling west thirty acres beside the house by the time dick and i became farming ageother boys we went to school with started when they were about eight or tenour family had given up all pretenses of ever becoming farmers my uncles had even tom away half of the front of the barn so they could get their cars inside to work on them away from the snow by the time i reached high school grandpa had died my uncles had gone off to columbus or akron looking for work and ma had sort of inherited the running of the farm starting at seventeen working for harelipped township trustee jim chevaliar i found farming a very difficult task half the time i had to guess what jim chevaliar wanted his words always came out in a wheezy raspy whisper covered all over with a shower of spit i never made fun though like the kids at school used to do i had been taught better than that i just tried to guess what he wanted and then do it maybe thats why he hired dick and me in the first place certainly there were lots of other boys around who knew more about farming i was glad to be making a little money but i wasnt always sure farming was the best way especially when the hay got stacked so high on the wagon that i couldnt throw a pitchfork full all the way to the top and it came tumbling back down on me to stick to my sweat or even worse when it came time to put it away in the hayloft hades itself surely can be no drier or hotter than the position furthest back in a hayloft in late afternoon right under the sunbaked tin roof where nary a breeze ever stirred and the chaff dinged to your sweaty skin like short prickly leeches i never thought i would live to crawl out of that hole into the air again but when i did and jim chevaliar took us home long after suppertime there was a certain innerglowing satisfaction at knowing that i had earned five more dollars i knew my five dollars never amounted up very fast but i pulled the little wad out of my watch pocket every night and shook out the chaff when i fell exhausted across my bed overlooking the ribbonlike dirt road i wondered how many mornings jim chevaliar would drive up that road or how many more mornings id be able to drag my aching bones out of bed to meet him finally come saturday the last of jim chevaliars hay was stored in the hotbox of a bam loft and dick and me began to wonder how we would spend our money we knew it would be for school clothes probably a pair of levis i needed a pair of shoes the only ones i had now had one sole flapping theyd already been half soled and they would have made it through the winter if i hadnt had to wear them in the hay field or maybe id buy some new shirts or socks it didnt matter i only wished there was more money so i could buy all my school things myself dick and me were just lying there in the yard under the maple tree nursing our aching muscles and looking at the montgomery ward catalogue trying to decide between all the things to buy and wishing we had more money when here come aubrey bradleys red pickup truck kicking gravel and dust for half a mile jim chevaliar never drove his old blue chevrolet pickup like that but then jim chevaliar was an old man never in a hurry for anything even when the hay was already cut and the sky darkened with rain clouds he just plodded on and somehow we always managed to be sitting in the swing on his front porch drinking ice water by the time the rains came but with aubrey bradleyhe was a young farmer maybe just in his early fortieseverything had to be done right now why dick hardly had time to tell anyone where he was goingnot that there was anyone much else than me to tell since ma was at work in town and we didnt fancy reporting to the girlsbefore he was sitting up on the back of that pickup holding on for dear life and looking for the world like he was afraid the dust and gravel was going to catch up with him at any moment i just kept on looking at the montgomery ward catalogue and wondering what dick would buy with his extra money i wondered how much more money he would have than i had since wed never worked for aubrey bradley before i didnt know if he paid bettern the fifty cents an hour that jim chevaliar paid or even if he paid that good he certainly looked more prosperous with his fine big white house sitting in the middle of those sloping hills right on the highway wed always wondered how much land he owned beyond the hill and out of sight i guess there had always been a lot of things we wondered about aubrey bradleys farm with its great herd of hereford id always fancied myself a beef cattle man too ever since i studied agriculture in the ninth grade course a hereford steer was out of the question as a class project so i planted a quarter acre of potatoes we would have done that anyway to get us through the winter as soon as i could i quit the ag class but i still admired aubrey bradleys herd of whitefaced herefords aubrey bradleys oldest daughter norma jean was in dicks class and she never acted like her family was anything special but howie willet who had worked on the farm since he was in the third grade and learned to drive tractors and trucks there was in dicks room too and howie always acted like he was something real special aubrey bradleys man not just a hired hand by the summer when aubrey hired dick howie was practically like a foreman so there were all kind of things i wanted to know about aubrey bradleys farm when dick got home that night was it harder working in baled hay than loose hay was howie willet really as important as he pretended and was the bradley house really as nice as it looked from the highway hidden behind that white picket fence imagine how put out i was when dick came home talking about ice tea he was raving about ice tea mrs bradley served it with the midday meal and it tastes like nothing you ever drunk before dick marveled he did arouse my curiosity some it wasnt like id never heard of ice tea before i had the rich folks ma worked for in town served it all the time i saw them drinking it once when they hired me on saturday to mow the lawn but i had to confess id never drunk any the only time we had any ice in our house was when ma bought a fiftypound block or two twentyfive pound blocksor what was left of it after a twenty mile ride from townhome in the trunk of the car for the ice box if there had ever been any extra ice it would have been too dirty after it was wrapped in a burlap bag and set in a tub in the trunk of the car to be used for ice tea so i was seventeen years old and had never drunk ice tea you would have thought that was a cardinal sin the way dick carried on that night he came home from working for aubrey bradley he talked about ice tea so much at supper that he got on everybodys nerveseven mas it was only when the girls started making fun of a sixteenyearold boy carrying on so that he was shamed into silence one thing dick didnt like was being made fun of but as soon as we went to bed he started again trying to tell me just how it tasted i told him i probably wouldnt like it he knew didnt eat anything new i reminded him how i got sick just trying to eat beets after that time he smacked his lips over them for so long i think dick got a special kick out of telling me about something i didnt like he just kept on talking about beets boiled buttered cooked any kind of way after he found out i couldnt eat them almost anything but beans and taters tasted strange to me oh but youd love ice tea he exclaimed its so cold but not like water its kinda sweet and moren that its got a peculiar twangyflavor he went to sleep looking forward more to the next days glass of ice tea than the sixtyfive cents an hour aubrey bradley paid f xaubrey needed extra help the next day because he was right in the thick of the third baling he hired me when he came after dick working for aubrey bradley was a heap bettern working for jim chevaliar in one respect with baled hay there werent any scapegoats had to stand all the way back in the hayloft under a burning tin roof pitching for dear life at the hay cutting you off from your one air hole least ways at first i thought it was better working in baled hay it wasnt too bad at first when the bales were as thick as the morning dew and you hardly had to move out of your tracks to throw em on the wagon moving between the rows i felt kinda good to be working with dick again him on one side of the wagon and me on the other pitchin bales for hallelujah like a team although we never said it in words didnt have to those ole bales said it for us just as fast as his hitwhump mine landed with another whump all while the morning sun rose we marched through the field behind that tractor and wagon whump whump whump the bales hitting end to end on the first tier side by side on the second and then end to end again whump whump about the time the sun soaked up the last of the dew off the clover all those easy bales were gone then we had to stray further and further from the tractors path to pick up bales needless to say the quicker we got back with em the less distance we had to run with em to catch the tractor one thing about howie willet when he was driving tractor he didnt wait he went right down the row at his set speed and either you were there with the bale or you ran and caught him always made like he couldnt see you when the bales were piled so high but i suspected he hated to see aubrey so far ahead on the baler by the time the sun dried out the alfalfa stubble which made it jab like spears up through the flapping sole of my shoe the bales were stacked five tiers high higher than i could reach my whumps had lost their umph and the bales i flung landed with soft plops about half way up the pile and there i went racing after the tractor pushing the bale the rest of the way up then i had to run back and git what i missed by the time we pulled into the barnyard to unload the first load that loose hay of jim chevaliars never looked so good both dick and me were nursing hands with palms red and rutted from the wire binding that the new baler used course the string that the old baler bound the hay with could cut your skin a lot quicker if you made the mistake of letting it slide along your fingers so i held on to the bales for dear life and when the right time came flung for all i was worth when that wagonful was unloaded i fell back on the stack in the barn more wilted than a tomato plant in a drought without a support stake and i dont believe jim chevaliars hayloft ever made me any hotter my tongue was hanging worsen a hound dogs after a useless rabbit chase i couldnt even respond when norma jean came to the back porch and hollered out whether or not we wanted her to fix us something cold to drink luckily for me howie went after it though i dont know why he was hot from just riding on the tractor he was gone a good while and i was glad i just lay there on the bales of hay panting and peering at my red blistering palms thats when dick started again man i sure hope he comes back with some of that good ice tea he crooned i was so hot that even the salty sweat trinkling through the corners of my mouth tasted good a good tall glass of water with ice cubes tinkling against the sides would have hit the spot perfectly but if he came back with ice tea i would jump for iteven if i did have a thing about not liking anything new anything wet would have been good but dick kept harping about ice tea almost bragging the way he did about buttered beets i was just hot i didnt care about his ice tea all i wanted was something cold man you know aint nobody serves ice tea in the barn i snapped maybe it was my implication that he didnt know etiquette more than my rebuke that riled him but i could tell he was riled by the way he tensed his body and snapped his shoulders back proudly after that he didnt say anything he just sat there and stared at me with beady eyes set in a sweaty forehead for his sake i kinda hoped howie would come back with ice tea for my sake though i was glad to see a pitcher of ice water nothing tastes as good as cold water when youre roasting inside but before i could cool off my innards that darn fool howie jumped on the tractor again and yelled something about aubrey getting way ahead of us now if theres anything makes you feel worsen you do bringing in a load its knowing that you got to start all over again and the hardest partthrowing hundredpound bales a mile highis just behind you and so fresh in your mind you cant even enjoy starting out at the bottom again the second load the one aubrey baled while we picked up yesterdays work was on a hillside dick looked at me with his stillbeady eyes and jumped off the wagon on the uphill side i didnt mind taking the downhill side where all the throwing was uphill because i was older just because dick was as straight and as strong as a young white oak tree and i was more like softwood maple was no reason to let himor howie who was in dicks class a grade behind me think i would slough off the hardest part besides id lived around dick long enough to know to stay out of his way when his eyes were beady our team work was broken up right away dick snatched bales of hay right and left and slammed them onto the wagonwhump whumpfwhump it was impossible for me to keep up with that pace throwing the bales uphill and all and with the spearing chaff penetrating my flapping shoe sole like i was barefooted and howie as soon as the bales were three or four tiers high couldnt see me anymore so he gauged his speed by dicks work on the uphill side and he kept chugging along faster and faster sweat and loose chaff ran in rivulets together under my tee shirt by dinner time i wondered just how in the world much work aubrey bradley expected for each sixtyfive cents the fact that it was the best wages i had ever earned was little consolation to my nowwelted hands and my right foot pricked through the flapping sole by so much chaff i was limping i would have quit with half a days pay but it was a good three miles home and i didnt think i could walk that far i sat atop the jogging towering stack of bales as we went in with the noon load and mulled over what i should do certainly i wouldnt do anything until after i ate dinner maybe by the time the dinner hour was over i would have found an easier way to load hay just another glass of ice water might shed an entirely different light on the matter the hot sun and the baling wire had taken some of the beady glisten out of dicks eyes too now youre gonna find out just how good ice tea tastes he half whispered high above the tractor drivers head i dunno id just as soon have a good glass of water i suggested you dont know wha chere talking about dick almost shouted then he boasted course you aint never tasted no ice tea before neither dick nor i was ever really sure whether or not he could hurt me if we really got mad as far back as when we were at lotteridge grade school dick was the only person i wouldnt put the boxing gloves on with at recess time and that included big ole bobby sampson in the class ahead of me and bullshouldered jay price i knew either of them could tear me apart anytime they wanted but sampson and jay were my best friends i knew they wouldnt hit me hard unless i hit hard first the one time i did forget myself and laid a straight left jab on sampson that swelled his eye i hurried and took off the gloves while the teacher and everyone looked at his bruise but i never would put the gloves on with dick even though somebody was always after us to go at it i guess i just never liked the idea of the only colored boys in school fighting each other we never discussed it but i was sure dick felt the same way everybody said i was scared of him everybody in school knew dick was stronger but both dick and i remembered the time i caught him around the neck and jerked him off that little russell boy who called dick a nigger i got scared he was going to kill the russell boy and i nearly choked dick to death ever since then dick never started a fight with me whenever he got mad he just kept goading trying to get me mad enough to forget myself and hit him or hed just sit real still and his eyes git real beady if he didnt feel like fighting thats the way he sat atop those bales of hay riding in for dinner where they would serve ice tea i couldnt be sure he was sulking because he looked away from me like he was surveying all aubrey bradleys meadows but he sat like that all the rest of the way across that bumpy field and i just figured it was because i had insulted him by suggesting i might not like ice tea anyway if he had been sulking on the wagon it left him as soon as we washed up and he saw those glasses of winecolored ice tea setting around the dinner table w i paid more attention to the fancy white table cloth and the curved glassfront china cabinet in the dining room and the fact that we were eating in the dining room and all of usdick and myself howie aubrey bradley mrs bradley and their two daughters it never dawned on me right then that in all that big fine white house hidden away from the highway behind the white picket fence that this was the only place for anybody to eat i just kept hoping i wouldnt get the white table cloth dirty or break the dishes dick just kept jabbing me in the ribs while aubrey bradley said the blessing and nodding toward the ice tea and grinning from ear to ear i just studied the silverware the way the knife and spoon rested on a napkin and the fork all by itself on the left side of the plate suddenly the bottom fell out of my stomach taking my appetite with it i didnt know anything about the kind of table manners that called for the knife and spoon on one side of the plate and the fork on the other god what was i supposed to do i declined the peas when howie passed them i didnt like peas and i wasnt hungry any longer anyway by the time the potatoes got to me i figured i could watch carefully and do what everyone else did i was just settling down inside when howie passed the pork chops and kept the fork off the platter for a moment i faltered and nearly dropped the platter whats the matter boy we been working you so hard youre weak aubrey laughed i grinned my left hand edged toward my fork on the table but somehow that just didnt seem right getting the meat off the platter with the same fork i was going to eat with course we did it that way at home but we didnt have the knife and spoon on one side of the plate and the fork on the other quickly i passed the platter on to dick an act which i immediately regretted when mrs bradley remarked on the sparseness of my meal i passed it off with the explanation that im a beans and tater man cant get much work out of you this afternoon on what youre eating aubrey barked looking at the little bit of potatoes on my plate i was beginning to hope that ice tea was everything dick said it was the first few minutes at the table had restored my reason enough for me to know that i couldnt go home at noon i wanted the extra two dollars and sixty cents for a handcarved leather belt with a silver buckle i saw in the montgomery ward catalogue so i swallowed hard and figured id make it through the afternoon as best i could on the potatoes and a couple glasses of ice tea i watched dick gulp down half a glass of the brown liquid almost swallowing the ring of lemon and a big square ice cube in his haste then he dived into the pork chops potatoes and peas on his plate i looked at the ice tea again it must be good i told myself if he can drink it like that besides it was the last thing between me and all those hundred pound bales id throw before nightfall my stinging puffed hands almost fumbled the cool glass of nourishment just feeling all those wires wrapped around em the very coolness of the outside of the glass was refreshing and it strengthened me i lifted the muddybrown tea to my lips and closed my eyes the first cold drops parched my tongue like it was water and quickly i tipped the glass and poured down half the coldness halfway to somewhere my taste buds translated the coldness into bitter indescribable strangling fluid it came back up into the glass and onto the white table cloth chased by gasps and chokes i begged mrs bradleys pardon saying the tea had gone down my wind pipe and i reached for some water it was only then that i realized ice tea was the only drink on the table i smothered a few more coughs and sputters with potatoes when mrs bradley came around again with the tea pitcher i politely said no thank you maam x seemed io wynton that his brother was in a particularly black mood for one thing it was hotwell over s v j a ninety againand after two weeks the muggy days had not ended for another the weekenders were even more worrisome than usual for the last two hours groups of them had been hanging around the cottage staring and asking questions it was especially hard on arnie because he never liked them in the first place if he answered at all it was usually something that made them stop suddenly look him up and down and stalk away well white people were like that it didnt pay to fool around with them mr raglin would probably say something about it when the day was over why dont you just take off wyn arnie said finally turning to wynton with nervous impatience go on take a swim i can handle these goons arnies face tensed as he spoke of the tourists for a while anyway he added darkly then turned and again leaned over the big freezer his white tshirt was wet at the armpits and beads of sweat dropped from the tip of his nose into the salted ice i aint tired wynton said perkily trying to show in his voice he really meant it anyway its only a couple more hours when the next boat gets back we can both wynton cut himself off for arnie had stopped churning the machine and was staring testily at the floor wynton knew he wanted to be alone maybe he said tentatively after a pause i could just run on over to the broadside and see about that ice we hardly got enough to to hell with the ice arnie said raising his voice i mean just forget about the ice you wasnt born to drag ice around here in the hot sun now stop botherin me hear just go on down to the beach and ill be along in a couple of hours arnie had tried to soften his voice for he did not often swear at wynton but it was too late and the younger boy glanced dejectedly at the back of his brothers head then left the cottage without a word outside was like an inferno it was the hottest part of the day the sun beat down on the patches of grass and the blazing white cottages with an intensity you could almost see could almost hear the maryland countryside rose and lowered in the distance and beyond the lake where the hills met the sky the faraway trees seemed to simmer in the heat wynton swallowed hard and tried to shake off his brothers words arnie was all right when he wasnt mad but lately he had been getting madder and madder a little madder every weekend wynton did not always understand him maybe it would be better that night when the work was done wynton breathed heavily through his mouth and continued along the narrow dirt path that led from the cottage area to the lake off in the distance the long white beach glared like a luminous band and he could hardly wait to plunge headlong into the water and let the lazy warm waves swallow up his body it seemed to be deserted most of the guests had taken the cruise to storey point or were lounging around the cottages where the shade trees were wynton could make out an abandoned rowboat and nearby a colony of those funny strutting little birds with the spearshaped bills that had been hanging around all week they looked so funny wynton had given them a name fussy grannies because they were so much like old people he named all the animals he saw the cottontails were dancers foxes were sneaky boys and squirrels were jello because they were so fidgety and shook all the time even at half a mile wynton could hear the grannies talking among themselves and fussing it was like each of them were constantly answering the other full of conviction like old people thats right thats right right wynton loved it along the lake in the summertime he loved the water and the beach and the dark woods where he and arnie rode horseback in the heat of the day he loved sitting at night at the edge of the lake tossing firecrackers into the blackness hearing them pop just before they struck the water sometimes arnie took him along to the broadside where they sat in the corner away from the crowd while arnie drank beer that was mostly on thursdays just before the weekend after that things changed pretty much mr raglin had to smile all the time around the tourists and that made him all the meaner around arnie mr raglin ran the ice cream house where the weekenders sat and talked when the sun was hot along with rev sharkey he was trying to make a man of arnie who had dropped out of college and was talking about joining the merchant marines dont throw it up just yet rev sharkey would say glancing at arnie in his nervous way the world hasnt failed yougive it a chance what kind of example will you be to your brother and such a young man but arnie was a loner and didnt much trust thingsor people not even rev sharkey not a lot anyway wynton reached the edge of the beach and felt the hot sand burn his feet not a whiff of wind was stirring and out across the lake the water was dead still like glass he was just about to climb out of his shirt when suddenly he froze somewhere on the beach a woman was laughing the sound like from another world caused wyntons heart to leap and he glanced quickly around the desolate beach at last he saw themwhat looked like half a dozen people clustered around an umbrella down at the far end somebody a woman had stood up now and was walking back and forth along the edge of the water from the distance she seemed to be dancing now wynton could hear the unison sound of hands being clapped and all at once a peel of laughter highpitched drunken the tourists were a strange lot they did such peculiar things from the city they came carloadsfull to lie upon the beach they lived in big white cottages along the highway and held loud parties far into the night daytimes you could find them at the ice cream house grinning nervously and asking all sorts of silly questions wynton did not always understand the world sometimes he agreed with arnie that it was all just a dream full of meaningless people doing meaningless things they seem real enough arnie always said but when you investigate try to touch them theres no one there its kind of scary wynton wynton was about to turn away when the dancing woman lifted her hand and seemed to call him she stood widelegged at the edge of the water waving back and forth and now and then he caught snatches of her voice wynton was a little afraid of the tourists they were all right he figured but you couldnt always tell reluctantly he buttoned his shirt and hurried down toward the umbrella wishing he had thought to wear his shoes when he arrived the tourists six of them three men and three womenwere sprawled across the sand one of them was mr cain who lived in washington but owned a guest house up the road the woman who had called him lay on her back a strange grin on her face youre the kid from the ice cream house arent you yes mam we were wondering if you could get us one of those boats well pay she didnt look exactly at him more at the top of his head her eyes laughing leave the boy alone ethel one of the men grunted lazily if the boats were for rent thered be somebody over there he was old and wrinkled like mr cain and the other man all the women were young shut up hal she replied and giggled im making time with the kid whats your name sonny wynton mam answered wynton feeling a tremor pass through his body why had he come he thought suddenly why hadnt he looked away pretended not to see them the smell of whiskey was everywhere these were the people who had come in last night well wynton youre just the cutest little thing but i saw you spying on me a minute ago anyway hows the fishing around here its all right i guess wynton stammered if you want a ill go and ask thats all right son said the wrinkled man brushing a fly from his forehead nobody here wants a boat the dancing woman sniggled againthis time kind of different and glanced out across the beach hal brought his own amusement she said at last thats how it is with these elderly bastards dont swear around the kid ethel the wrinkled man said but he didnt seem to much care the fly had returned and was giving him trouble what i mean the woman went on again studying the top of wyntons head is that this here is mr shulan hes a united states congressman very important youve been reading about him im sure you study the government in school no mam wynton said uncomfortably glancing nervously at his feet he had tried to give the answer a kind of finality maybe now they would let him go of course he doesnt study any government interrupted another woman who looked exactly like the first that is they both wore skimpy bathing suits and plucked their eyebrows like in the movies they both looked like marilyn monroe thats in the high schools for cryin out loud well he oughta be studying it said ethel teach him about the democratic process about the wonderful job hal js doing there was a loud sniggle just then but wynton did not look up when finally he managed to raise his eyes it was only to gaze nervously out across the lake from the direction of the boathouse a faint breeze made ripples in the water and far away the trees on jacksons island swayed gently back and forth wynton remembered the time he had swum all the way across and then back again and hadnt told anybody arnie would have thrashed him then he shifted his weight awkwardly from one foot to the other as if to break the spell the quiet day suddenly exploded with sound the earsplitting foghorn honked twice and then was silent captain adams old excursion boat was making its sluggish way toward the boathouse a trail of churning water followed its slow course along the lake and tourists stood on both decks staring silently at the shore the explorers are back ethel said tiredly slapping loudly at her thigh have your last cocktail children god what a weekend mr shulan took a long swallow from a flask he had been holding on his lap and placed it carefully underneath one of the blankets we should have gone to the peninsula like i said no offense cain its been great ethel giggled again theres a platform at the peninsula and hal could do his stuff everybody laughed andrew jackson shulan the third man said the new savior from the west its a commodity said mr cain he does it very well the congressman remained silent seeming bored he crossed his hairy legs on the blanket and stared listlessly at the lake wynton saw his chance and took it excuse me miss he stammered pointing to the boat and without waiting for a reply took off across the sand toward the boathouse he ran quickly not daring to look back funny people he thought at last reaching the edge of the water and letting his feet wade in the shallow warm surf kind of scary though wynton had never met a congressman they ran the country miss stevenson saidcongressmen and senators and the president they were the spirit of america and every kid should want to be one but arnie wasnt like that and wynton loved his brother and wanted to be like him life was so awfully strange sometimes you didnt always know what was what for at the same time wynton did want to be a congressman or maybe the president and amie they all said would never amount to anything at the boathouse the passengers were already filing down the wobbly ramp observing them wynton lost all thoughts of the congressman and of arnie they were so funny the tourists for all his shyness wynton loved to observe them watch them do their funny things like lying halfnaked in the blazing sun or stomping around in the woods in their short pants or funniest of all shaking their bodies on the dance floor over at the broadside arnie called them a plague but wynton enjoyed them from a distance there was something a little strange about the tourists like most white people they smiled a lot but you couldnt always tell after the boat was empty captain adams said there was no sweeping to do so wynton followed the last of the passengers from the boathouse and down the narrow beach the crowd fanned out along the sand looking like hundreds and hundreds of strange and funny birds already some had entered the lake and the day rang with splashing water the squeals of excited women more umbrellas in strange lively colors burst open along the beach and gay expensivelooking blankets dotted the sand wynton ran wildly along the beach feeling fresh and happy in spite of the heat when the weekenders came it was like a carnival full of colors and the music of a hundred transistors all playing at once noise followed them everywhere on the beach at the ice cream house in the big white cottages where they held their latenight parties americans ruled the world miss stevenson once said because they had more energy like honey bees to wynton they were more like flies nervous and jittery with nothing to do america was the greatest nation in the world she liked to say but arnie who had worked last summer in haiti didnt agree we dont know what a nation is he had shouted to wynton one night as they sat at the edge of the lake a nation wyn is a kind of tribea large family you might saywith millions and millions of brothers and sisters nephews cousins they eat the same food speak the same language they even look something alike they are one people and to defend that principle every man woman and child stands ready to die thats what a nation is wynan identity a pride americans dont understand that well whatever it was wynton wanted to be a leader a congressman perhaps and be a credit to his country thinking it over he found a deserted spot near the trees and lay his head down in the sand musedly watching a small rowboat filled with shouting people a little ways out from the shore wynton must have fallen asleep for all of a sudden he lay wide awake upon the sand knowing something horrible had happened on the beach about a dozen yards away at the edge of the lake a large group of people had gathered round mr shulan and someone was handing him a pistol get those kids back someone shouted and suddenly a woman screamed his heart pounding wynton leaped madly from the ground and hurried down to the shore fearing what he might see but no more able to turn back than had he been drawn by a magnet the tourists had formed a tight little knot near the lake and had fallen strangely silent staring excitedly into the water something very wrong had happened to the day and overhead the scattered clouds hung motionless in the sky a scrawny old woman in a pink bathing suit the blue veins showing in her legs made an ugly face showing her teeth and a groaning sound deep in her chest a man nearby grabbed his little boy and held him high in the air to see after a long while wynton at last saw it about thirty feet out what looked like half its body protruded from the water and only a brief flicker of its tongue let you know it was a live thing and not some tree limb some large twig washed in from the deep mocassin one of the men said straight from hell get those people back wynton stared at the treelimb object silent and still in the trem bling water and felt a strange fear all his life he had seen them a hundred times slithering from the water in the still of the day going silently easily to their secret places the lake area was full of them so the old people said wynton called them old grey because thats how they werecool and damp and mysterious often he would discover one in the road its long body flattened by a car and pick it up and fling it into the weeds sometimes he kept it stripping its skin and tying it to the light string in his room at mr raglins some of the kids made belts he had never before feared old grey but this one seemed different with the crowd all around wynton looked at the congressman who was doing something to the pistol and then out at the mute motionless object in the water and breathed silently it could have crossed the lake he figured and gone in at the island or farther down the beach but that was old grey he didnt have much of a brain except for getting food he didnt know about tourists and children and safety precautions and things he lived in his own little world a slow secret place where people didnt go now he was trapped unable to stay in the water and blocked from getting on the beach but he didnt seem to panic in spite of all the people snakes were mostly like that wynton was staring regretfully at the water when suddenly it happened he would remember it for years to come one of those brief experiences unknown to adults that so powerfully affect a young child reality for a brief moment seems to run amok all the familiar things are there but somehow disjointed and horrible like a nightmare the congressman had raised the pistol above his head and was waving it gaily back and forth the gesture sure practiced reminded wynton of the ringmaster he had once seen and feared when the great circus came to town let im have it shulan a man shouted the filthy communist as if answering the command the congressman a wrinkled old man with trembling hands turned abruptly and without aiming fired twice at the snake both shots missed skipping out across the lake and making little splashes in the glassy water again he fired then again and again his pale old body jerking with each report so out of place there on the beach he was faintly terrifying somehow one of the bullets struck the mocassin twitched violently seemed to linger in the faltering day then sank lazily into the lake the murky water swallowed up its body and turned a dull red wynton was terrorstricken the scene in its senseless violence was like the tribal ceremonies you saw in the movies the crowd had gathered around the congressman and were taking his picture others rushed to the lake gazing intently at the bloody water wynton could smell their bodies the tanning lotion they used on their skin these were the americansthat great grinning people who had captured the world without realizing it wynton found himself running breathlessly across the sand headed nowhere but needing suddenly to erase it all he raced along the edge of the lake hoping the lazy ripple would somehow drown out the sound of the cheering he thought of miss stevenson his proper little schoolteacher it was funny how people lied and sometimes they didnt know that they lied arriving at the boathouse he dropped heavily onto the ground and lay trembling on the sand he remained for a long time catching his breath the sun had begun to get lower in the sky and suddenly a cool breeze from across the lake bathed his moist body around him he heard the country soundsa bird call the bark of a dogas evening descended over the lake it was getting on toward four oclock he remembered suddenly and arnie would be along soon and the thought of arnie was like awakening from a nightmare wynton lay motionless and silent at the edge of the lake waiting for his brother back in antiquity there was a saying that is still very much with us today the saying is render unto caesar that which is caesars and render unto god that which is gods this was a tacit assumption of that fact that there was to be a split between the secular and spiritual realms politicians were to minister to the secular realm and churchmen to the spiritual realm even then there were great conflicts between politician and pope the two swords doctrine manifested in the above quote which was a source of conflict down through the ages still lingers with us of late it is demonstrated in the conflict that goes on within the minds and souls of religious leaders today in the area of civil_rights just how much should a clergyman concern himself with the secular movement of negroes into the street to protest how involved should be get in the basic mundane struggle of black people to leave the ghetto and throw off their ghettorization for negro ministers this has often proven to be a thorny question with no fast and sure answer for many white ministers it has proven to be a question that they have refused to meet head on and have attempted to ignore it whenever and wherever possible but there is a discernible change in their reaction to the civil_rights movements more and more white ministers are coming to the front lines some assuming roles of leaders but david reimers white protestantism and the negro oxford university press is not so much concerned with what the various white christian leaders are doing but rather my purpose is to provide the historical perspective for viewing what they are doing it is perhaps too shopworn to repeat that the most segregated hour in america is sunday morning from eleven to twelve when america is worshipping this is a very provocative and pitiful paradox mr reimers book does help to understand how this blightful fact got to be such understanding the background does not of course cure the ailment but it does provide us with a basis for making intelligent diagnosis and the ultimate application of preventive measures to this end mr reimers book furnishes us with a valuable piece of literature it is perhaps necessarily incomplete because this is not the kind of subject that lends itself to a definitive treatment it is easy and intelligible reading and will give the reader certain historical insights into whys and hows of american white christianity and its relationship to american black people this is what the author sets out to do and after some pages you get the impression that he has succeeded the awakenings of africa are numerous and many are lost with that part of history that is conveniently listed as unrecorded it is refreshing to read a book that makes an admirable attempt at recording parts of the more recent political awakening of africa rupert emerson and martin kilson have coedited an interesting book entitled the political awakening of africa prenticehall new jersey the method of chronicling this more recent awakening is to collect the speeches of some of africas leading nationalists and leaders starting back with j e casely hayford and felix eboue and their special brand of nationalism and continuing down to more current leaders and their brand of african political nationalism the book is outstanding for what is included and the light that it sheds on the basic thinking of african leaders some years ago the book points to the former african desire to better conditions within the existing framework of political domination by for eign powers the goal of these early leaders was to convince the ruling powers that the african was worthy of better treatment on one hand and to make the african more deserving and faithful to the colonial country on the other as stated above the book is impressive for what it says but it is also impressive because it does not say as much as one would like hearing the leaders of africa past and present talk about african political problems is a very enlightening and realistic method of understanding what the african thinking and goals really were and the methodology they sought to employ to realize these ends the amount of literary and intellectual salt the reader has to apply to get a full understanding is correspondingly reduced when the subject matter is presented in this fashion the upshot of all this is that one is impressed with what is said and how but really wishes that the authors had given us more while the old theatre axiom always leaving wanting more is good theatre technique the result of the same feeling here is that the reader is left partially pleased but generally frustratedbrooks johnson chester himes the heats on putnams and sons new york tells of the havoc that a misplaced cache of heroin in harlem can cause to do this he uses addicttypes with their full complement of supportive characters sometimes these characters come off and sometimes they dont but himes does manage to keep an element of suspense in the story right up to the very last page he is extremely successful in his attempts at humor this is perhaps the very strong point of the book humor is generally a visual experience and to elicit the kind of humorous response he gets from his use of the printed word demonstrates truly a marvelous talent unfortunately that talent does not obliterate the shortcomings in things such as dialogue and feel the reader is left with the feeling that mr himes would have been better off to have returned to harlem to restudy some of the patterns and vernacular that now are in vogue rather than depending on his memory for things about harlem that were true before he left there for residence in paris harlem is elusive because it is constantly changing and to capture even a minute part one must have uptodate firsthand contact it is easy to discover the fact that mr himes is a talented writer but it is equally apparent that the talent was not uniformly applied in places and things that required extensive hard work we find the author apparently settling for less than his native abilities could produce perhaps if harlem were not so well known to us the book would have been more palatable and believable but the harlem of mr himes does not come off with the reality we have seen in person and read about in the works of some others who strangely enough did not generally appear to have the basic talent that mr himes possesses in his book mr himes fails twice he fails himself and what he is no doubt capable of and he fails harlembrooks johnson let us speak with each other for a time about the brotherhood of blackness which might almost just as well be called the k fellowship of the wretched and the disinherited fanon called us the damned of the earth all of us club members soul brothers and sisters if you will are members of the brotherhood not because we organized this club biologically on the basis of race and color but because of what western man made of the factors of color and race we are members not because we wanted especially to be members we are members because we have been made to pay the dues for membership in terms of being the victims of the crudest exploitation in the entire history of mans inhumanity to man ours is more or less an involuntary membership we have been for centuries the victims of white supremacy that fountainhead of the western judeochristian world white supremacy racism brought the club together all over this unhappy earth and designated the members of the brotherhood as niggers it was the great recruiter but now the time is long past due for us to call the meeting of the brotherhood to order the first order of business being the bringing about of the downfall of our founder let us stop squabbling among ourselves over favors from the founder a part of our task is to bring about the early demise of great white fatherism we are not racists ours is a struggle to the death against racism so now it is time for us club members africans and africanamericans to cease looking at ourselves and at each other through the jaundiced eyes of the western world which is psychologically white and which looks with illconcealed contempt upon all the members of the brotherhood all the darker peoples who dwell upon this earth the thing that struck me most sharply about the statements written by john a williams and thomas echewa in negro digest on the question of africans and afroamericans was that all three articles read like they had been written by nonclub members of european descent and if not certainly by white men masquerading in the skins of blacks both williams and echewas statements remained most of the time on a highly superficial level as they recorded loads and loads of surface truths and halftruths and numerous irrelevancies which would hardly seem to have much bearing on the fundamental question facing our relationship because this question has nothing at all to do with how africans drink cognac or conduct themselves at bourgeois parties or the boisterousness of the lowerclass negro americans what is the fundamental question the thing is that afroamericans and africans have a common heritage which is africa which had a history thousands of years before the white man discovered it western man works from the proposition that history and civilization began for any corner of the earth at the moment it is discovered by the white man hence the myth that columbus discovered america even though there were people here when the man arrived but you werent discovered you know until mister charles got around to you get the picture you just existed in a kind of limbo in africa and in asia and on the islands of the seas waiting for the man to loom up over the horizon so that history and civilization could begin for you you noble savage you instead of waiting for godot or lefty you waited patiently for whitey let us also stress the fact that afroamericans and africans have a community of experiences visavis the white man it is the community of oppression cruel inhuman racist exploitation slavery and segregation and discrimination on this side of the atlantic at the journeys end colonialism and the slave trade at the genesis in mother africa where man first walked straight and upright on both sides of the ocean the impact on our personalities on our manhood on our selfhood was total if the impact on the african personality was less in its totality than the impact on the afroamerican it was merely a question of degree the fact of the matter is in both cases we still very often seek human dignity and pride in all the wrong places we seek dignity in the eyes of whitey who deprived us of it in the first instance but the slave master can never endow dignity upon the slave nor can the colonial master endow more than a superficial dignity upon the socalled native he who looks for dignity from his master is a fool it is up to the slave and the native to affirm their own dignity all else is false pride and vainglorious stupidity all else is gunga din and uncle tom and mister johnson let us cite a few examples of the whiteness of these learned essays on african and afroamerican relations mr echewa says in my opinion any white who is willing to entertain an african in his home could hardly be accused of negrophobia and further there is of course the story told of an african who sat beside a white couple in church the couple got up and moved to another pew after the service they came to the boy to apologize they had discovered that he was an african they even invited him to dinner in their home but the incident would seem to disprove his proposition that any white person who entertained an african could not be a negrophobe the real question here is did the african accept the invitation certainly what the white couple was saying in effect was you african blacks are all right its just the american niggers we cant stomach if the african did indeed accept the invitation one can only comment that it would seem that his dignity lies in another direction for example some african diplomats visited atlanta georgia not too long ago to observe the american way of free elections it seems that a ghana diplomat went innocently into one of the election booths and got roughed up by the evervigilant atlanta police you see they had mistaken him for an american citizen a faux pas of enormous proportions and of course upon discovering their grave and international error the city fathers hastened to apologize but the african brother said if there is any apology due at all it is due to the black people who live here in atlanta and to whom it happens every day brothers and sisters this is dignity believe me this is in the spirit of the brotherhood of blackness that when you deny the least of us you deny us all john a williams says there is nothing like a trip to africa to make an american negro realize just how american he is of course this is not the essential feeling of some negro americans who have made the trip i imagine it depends on what your values are what you go to africa looking for if you go to africa looking for a replica of the west if you look at africa out of tired cynical western eyes better known these days as white objectivity then you are bound to feel estrangement but if you go there for a new dialogue of values convinced that the values you left behind you in the west are fake and phony and deathly sick then you will have a different feeling about your experience the other thing is some black americans when they go to africa go there with whiter attitudes than those of white americans they are whiter than white americans in much the same way that some excolonial africans are more french than the french and more british than the british john a williams gratuitous comment on his feeling of extreme americanness is a case of unadulterated superpatriotism and shameless flagwaving of the american legion variety and is at one with the gunga din uncle tom bit that floyd patterson pulled when he had the extreme bad taste to bring religion into his battle of words with cassius clay the champ i mean the bit that he was fighting clay again to win the championship back for america as if clay were unamerican because he chose to be called muhammad ali does not floyd know that one of the founding principles of this republic was religious freedom but here we had the roles clearly and classically defined muhammad ali was the sassy arrogant nigger too big for his britches and poor floyd was the new white hope who had assumed the very tough assignment to cut the nigger down to size also went to africa did not need the trip to africa to realize how american was the negro is the most american of americans with the possible exceptions of the socalled indians i knew i was american to begin with very american most american notwithstanding i did not go to africa looking for america went to africa looking for africa and found her in all her wondrous mysterious magnificent diversity for africa is many different things and many different peoples in the summer and fall of arrived in lagos the capital of nigeria and drove in a land rover miles over the african countryside we drove from lagos to ibadan capital of the western region then to historic benin city then to asaba where i first glimpsed the great river niger and crossed on a ferry to onitsha then on to enugu the capital of the eastern region leaving enugu we traveled deep into the niger delta at port harcourt and bonny and calibar from there we came back to enugu and then followed the niger river hundreds of miles all the way to the ancient city of timbuktu the terrain changing before our eyes from the awesomely beautiful mangroves in the gulf of guinea at the edge of the continent to the delta region to the gorgeous lush rain forest to savanna land to the backdoor of the great sahara and the people we were in african countries and everywhere i went people called me brother welcome american brother shall never forget the evening i arrived at margaret ekpos home in aba in the eastern region of nigeria i had driven there with martin leighton a tall rugged friendly bbctype britisher mrs ekpo is a nigerian champion of the cause of womens rights and sits in the house of chiefs of the eastern region she had expected us and had invited some young nigerian politicians to her home to meet us when we martin and i were introduced to them they surged toward me and shook my hand and embraced me and said almost in unison welcome american brother martin stood there beside me invisible and unnoticed growing paler by the second mrs ekpo gestured to her constituents that i was not the only visitor and suddenly they turned embarrassed to martin leighton and said oh yes welcome friend i had many similar experiences whether i was in the crowded cities or in what the british call the bush and i had no need to hang out with englishmen or americans in order to get an orientation as to what africans are like i had not come to africa for that john a williams tells us further that americans and britishers accuse the nigerians of the habit of mixing good cognac with ginger ale a valid complaint according to mr williams presumably this was called to our attention to prove that nigerians were crude in the extreme and unsophisticated maybe even just downright uncivilized on the contrary all it really demonstrated was the shallowness of my american brothers thinking it exposed moreover a terribly brainwashed naivete since when did the matter of how one mixes ones whiskey become a gauge of the degree of civilization of a people as a distinguished writer we expected mr williams to give words newer deeper meanings mr echewa of nigeria seems to say that the afroamerican whom the visiting africans really hold in deep disdain is the lower class negro whatever the phrase encompasses in any event if it were true that stateside africans are disdainful of the lower class negro if we understand the implications of the phrase this great disdain would include the vast majority of our nations black population which would be to say that generally speaking visiting africans are disdainful of the american negro because williams optimism notwithstanding the vast majority of american negroes live out their lives in that lower class category and have never even walked across a college campus in another burst of optimism mr williams says but since the american society from the s has been mostly concerned with social changes or progress it seems inevitable that before long power will be shared by black americans this is the most incredible interpretation of the last years in my country that i have ever come across and by a black american i mean where has the brother been all statistics available point to a very different development even the federal governments own statistics which are usually overly optimistic point to an alarmingly growing gap between the income of the negro people and the income of the nation as a whole and income is precisely where the power is at and power is never shared power is taken as per usual the great frederick douglass was right power concedes nothing without a demand it never did it never will one other thing i believe john a williams to be speaking for a very small minority of negroes including himself perhaps when he states that many negroes were jealous of africans achieving their independence i think most negroes reacted if at all very sensibly with pride and a deep sense of identification with their african brothers the thing for africans and afroamericans to understand it seems to me is that just as there was a community of oppression at the hands of whitey the difference in degree and in the style and structure of the oppression notwithstanding there is also a community of objectives in this brotherhood of blackness in this fellowship of the damned the disinherited the community of objectives is a mutual determination to throw off the black mans burden all over this whiteoriented earth let us face a few cruel indisputable facts there is no need or place for arrogance between us members of the brotherhood africa is not free and independent yet and neither is the american negro news coming out of that turbulent continent tells us every day that european presence is still a fundamental reality particularly in the economic sphere but also politically coups and rumors of coups reflect the grim reality of a european omnipresence playing its centuriesold game of divide and conquer repeat there is no need for arrogance between us duespaying club members of the brotherhood but there is a crying need for understanding fundamental understanding that we members of the brotherhood will stand or fall together that when the prestige of africa rises the prestige of black men rises all over the earth yes even in america and that every blow the black man in america strikes for his freedom is a blow for freedom over the length and breadth of this wonderful and terrible earth africans afroamericans we can not run away from each other even if we wanted to obviously some of us engage in such wistful thinking and work out our frustrations in pathetic acts of wish fulfillment but we wear the badge of our oppression in the color of our skin we are chained together the yoke is on our mutual backs the pain still throbs the scars still show physically psychologically politically socially economically let us stop fighting one another its time to put an end to this petty wrangling like dogs around the masters table snapping at each other in one pathetic scramble for the scraps the master throws at us vying with each other to see who licks the masters hand and gets a fond pat on the head let us rather emphasize the fundamental things which keep the brotherhood together and forge a unity from johannesburg south africa to jackson mississippi to throw off the black mans burden it is left up to us to make this the freedom century it is up to us to forge a unity of our minds and muscles dedicated to the proposition that we shall lay this burden down and free all mankind everywhere it was march and it was cold in boston a group of men left a tavern encountered some british redcoats and shots were fired the first to die was a man named crispus attucks he was a black man this incident was later called the boston massacre and dates the beginning of the american revolution attucks death then started the american revolution but attucks himself didnt really see himself as a revolutionary like so many other men of that day he merely wanted change but faced with obstinance and resistance of a most determined nature revolution was the only course attucks later became something of a hero for negroes despite the fact that he was not acting in a negro cause but rather in a capacity of a citizen agitating for his rights in his office in the state house of massachusetts state attorney general edward w brooke is only a few blocks away from the actual scene of the boston massacre and closer still to the graves of attucks and the men who died with him that night it would appear that brooke will in many ways be a th century attucksa reluctant revolutionary edward w brooke says he is a man who would like to do his job as just another american public servant but there are several factors which prevent this first he is a gifted and dedicated administrator second he is eminently successful as a public servant third he is politically ambitious and fourth he is a negro these elements combined with his republican party membership have set the stage for him to help bring about a revolution that he really wishes wasnt necessary there are several unsettled factors which bear upon the revolution mr brooke is about to help launch perhaps the most important one is his successfully campaigning this fall for the u s senate seat vacated by leverett saltonstall it is generally felt however that he will be the next u s senator from massachusetts for three reasons brooke campaigned on a paltry budget for the attorney generals office of massachusetts in and won he won because the voters of massachusetts had reached the point where they felt that anybody who promised to clean up the corruption in massachusetts was worth a try then he was a republican in a normally democratic state and negro to boot in the voters returned brooke to office with the largest plurality of any republican in the u s and in doing so they gave him the greatest plurality ever achieved by a republican in massachusetts the reason for this is that edward brooke diligently kept his campaign promises and prosecuted those his office found guilty of corruption while holding public office he was no respector of party lines trying republican and democrats as he found them the result was the people of massachusetts have a great deal of confidence in their attorney general as a man who has integrity intelligence and their best interests at heart this explains the first reason given why edward brooke might well become the next u s senator from massachusetts for as it was expressed by a cab driver he did a damned good job the office of the attorney general of massachusetts is decorated in soft muted tones of blue they are distinctly masculine but obviously chosen with taste there is a very strong suggestion of warmth and cordiality with an unrelenting undertone of efficiency and businesslike feel to the office to a very great degree the office reflects the personality and character of the man himself moreover mr brooke is the kind of individual who has the power of projection he is able to put across the kinds of fine touches that are looked for in men but he does so with such ease that the result is confidence in the strength and sincerity of the man as one might expect he is very well tailored in clothes whose colors and cuts impute stability and taste he is a handsome man and in these days when politicians must look good he easily falls into the part with his clean facial features and hair thats attractively greying at the temples he has a look of quiet assurance about him that many men who know what theyre about have the above notwithstanding and perhaps because of it the second most important reason for his probable victory next fall is the fact that he has charisma he has the capacity to excite people upon contact he can communicate with people but in addition he has the talent for doing so at the level and manner in which they seek to be reached he has that indefinable quality that carries a special message for individuals despite the fact that he may meet them in group circumstances in this age of mechanical mass communication he still does a great deal of campaigning in person but in person or not he still projects that feeling to an audience that he holds the key or answer to whatever it is that they are looking for in a leader the third reason he stands a very good chance of winning in the fall is the fact that he is a negro mr brooke has stated that he feels the race issue has neither helped him nor hindered him he wants to be judged on his personal merits as a public office holder and not for the color of his skin despite his genuine wishes on the matter his race is not going to be overlooked and the voters of massachusetts will have his race in mind when they vote massachusetts takes middleclass pride in the fact that it was liberal enough to elect a negro attorney general but this feeling of pride is further compounded because massachusetts has come in for its share of negative publicity on the civil_rights score and scores of massachusettsians are righteously anxious to overcome this stigma further theres nothing more boastful than a white middleclassed american who has taken a negro to his bosom some of my best friends are negroes if the negro turns out to be exceptional this attitude is merely more intense to a great extent this is one kind of feeling that brooke will be facing in predominantly middleclass massachusetts he is the proof of the liberalism and intelligence of the electorate of massachusetts while at the same time he has also freed their consciences and it is likely they will want to ride the crest of this racial euphora to the limits if it appears from the above that mr brooke will walk into the u s senate without any opposition then its time to point out that some of the points mentioned above breed opposition in investigating and prosecuting graft impartially he has made enemies inside and outside of his partysome having considerable influence it is likely that the democrats will run the mayor of boston john collins who is reputed to be a tough campaigner and is a known vote getter he is confined to a wheelchair and this can have advantages for him similar to inherent advantages in brookes color but should brooke win the stage is then set for something of a revolution in american politics for the past thirtythree years or so the republicans have been losing political strength eisenhower was elected on his own popularity and personality rather than as a party candidate and for the exception of his two terms the democrats have held the presidency since roosevelt one of the major causes of this is the fact that the republican party has virtually ignored the immigrant and minority population of the major cities its a political fact of life that there are certain states with their large electoral vote count that a party must carry in order to win a national election these very same states have as the basis of their large vote count large numbers of immigrant and minority groups the republicans in ignoring these people have isolated and insulated themselves from the people who provide the political pivot in any nationwide campaign the republicans have become identified with money and not men there are many old guard republicans who prefer it like this to them the party is a collection of select clubs that get together every four years to propose a candidate these are the men according to brooke who would rather lose the ball game just as long as they decide who is going to pitch it is because of this adamant and arbitrary position taken by the more conservative brooke calls them pseudoconservative leaders of the party that men like brooke lindsay romney and others are seeking a change but changes wont come easy and in fact a revolution will be necessary within the republican party before the needed change will take place reluctant as he might be to take on the power elite within the party as much as he wishes it was not imperative brooke will play a most strategic and vital role in the revolution there are many negroes who are wisely afraid they will be taken for granted by the democrats and thus lose their effectiveness as a voting block the voting statistics of bear this concern out in some cases the democrats rolled up percentages in negro precincts of over on the whole the percentages were well over because of the position and policies of the republican party many black people felt they had no choice but to vote democratic essentially what this does to the negro is to mitigate and dilute his political influence at a time when he is aware that civil_rights and other things he wants are wrapped up in his strength at the ballot bax there are some negro republican leaders around the country who have been watching this development and are just waiting and hoping for the time when the national republican party can produce a platform and attitude that negroes can support recently a republican leader in memphis told this writer man we been catching hell here lately but colored folks are getting just a little bit afraid the democrats figure they got the all them sewed up if you want to see some real fireworks let guys like lindsay start setting policy with a policy consistent with lindsays views there are negro republicans who now hold office who could provide the rallying point for negroes coming back to the party of lincoln the mayor of springfield ohio robert c henry is one he represents the new breed of negro republican who is genuinely interested and informed about local and national issues he is a republican and proud of it but adds not the goldwater type but the real trump card is edward brooke brooke steadfastly maintains that he doesnt want to be known as a negro leader he wants to be evaluated as a man but he also knows that the title of negro leader will fall to him if he becomes a u s senator if this title helps to rebuild the party along more realistic and liberal lines as it inevitably will then he is for it because he is a party man as a man he believes in civil_rights for everyone as a republican he believes in the future of his party as a negro he believes in his right to be a man and a republican without any special attention focused upon him because of his race the role of the revolutionary has been thrust at brooke because much of what he wants as a man a citizen and republican are denied because of the defeatist policies of the ruling circle of his party because he is ambitious intelligent and seems to have history on his side it is likely that he will emerge a winner but win or not his role as a leader in the attucks tradition is already assured thats victory enough for any man the preponderance of educational literature leans toward drastically revising or discarding the grade system they be analyzed in social class and selfconcept or social class and achievement most economically disadvantaged negroes fare poorly in our traditional graded education system tragically a vast majority of innovations placed into the grade system like the first old new england bridges covered with deep snow collapse from the weight of entrenched obsolescence causes of failure despite the fact that educators continually seek to develop school programs which will retain all youth until they graduate from high school approximately onethird of our nations population drop out of school as early as their respective local laws permit equally as alarming is the united states department of labor study entitled school and early employment experience which concluded that adverse school experience was the major reason given for dropping out this observation has been borne out by numerous other studies dropping out of school is an effect and not a cause of school failures there are many reasons why students fail to keep up in grade assignments foremost is the difference in sexual readiness where girls achieve academic maturity earlier than boys if we add other physiological and social differences especially ethnic to the personality matrix it becomes apparent that our concepts of normal students should be reevaluated certainly if as many social practitioners suggest negroes as a whole are even more disadvantaged than white students then it seems educationally unsound to expect such disadvantaged or deprived students to fit a traditional normal student mold while all of those who drop out of school do not reflect poverty backgrounds a disproportionately large number of dropouts are negro students who come from povertystricken homes school is no less painful for a majority of the lowerincome negro students who do not drop out those who stay in school realize that dropping out only accelerates their reaching a fulltime unproductive life leading to social oblivion why they might ask should a person drop out of school and into unemployment for which is hotterthe academic frying pan or the unemployment fire many educators are aware of the weaknesses in the grade system and have tried new techniques to educate socially and economically disadvantaged students but alas our formal educational road to failure is replete with good intentions to improve the traditional system john goodlad a renowned educator surmises that interest ability and other special groups within graded systems do not significantly expedite the learning advantages found in nongraded schools a primary reason for the relative ineffectiveness of modified grade systems is their builtin curricular rigidity other innovations in the grade system have taken on the forms of field visits recreational programs and tutoring in their efforts to correct program deficiencies many traditional schools have undergone processes closely resembling neighborhood conservation activities in an urban renewal program they have sought to conserve the best of the existing system and to abolish any outmoded portions and like neighborhood conservation these efforts merely delay the time before complete redevelopment must take place current studies further indicate that schools which are based upon grades do not usually enhance the selfconcepts of low achieving negro students it seems that the elements of standard curricula and periodic grading guarantee a greater percentage of students who will have negative feelings of their self worth each year thousands and thousands of negro students leave school believing that they cannot succeed in middleclass competition to prove their point they display report cards which are liberally decorated with failing or nearfailing grades some critics of the grade system maintain that such a rigid system cannot satisfactorily provide culturally disadvantaged students with adequate visual and auditory perception or language and speech patterns in our lockstep grade system the criticism continues lowerincome negro students drop further and further behind experience less and less success until they earn the titles of underachievers slow learners and poor readers their inability to succeed in the grade system perpetutes cultures of poverty so why not try nongraded education when grading is dropped criticizing the grade system john goodlad and robert anderson authors of the nongraded elementary school wrote first a certain amount of progress is held standard for a years work then the content of the work is laid out within the grade to be covered and to a degree mastered the slow are pulled and stretched to fit the grade sometimes because their godgiven limbs lack enough elasticity they are nonpromoted left behind where presumably another year of stretching will do the trick as for the gifted students the authors conclude that they are compressed and contracted to fit the grade in time they learn to adapt to a pace that is slower than their natural one by at least states had one or more communities experimenting with nongraded education the earliest primary unit elementary schools were given many names including the primary schools of green bay wisconsin wichita kansas provo utah the junior primary unit at dale mabry elementary tampa florida the ungraded primary in corona california unified school district and the primary unit plan at marblehead massachusetts the first high schools to try nongrading were the melbourne nova and satellite high schools all of florida chippewa valley high school mt clemens michigan and middletown high school in rhode island which became the first completely nongraded six year secondary school in unlike the grade structure the nongraded structure is based upon the premises that a year of school life depending upon the student may mean much more or much less than a year of progress in a subject area a students progress is not seen as being unifiedhe may spurt ahead in one subject area and lag behind in another adequacy of a students progress is determined by comparing a students attainment to his ability learning is viewed vertically or longitudinally rather than horizontally slow progress is provided for by allowing the student a longer time to do given blocks of work thereby minimizing failures rapid progress is provided for by encouraging bright students to move ahead without regard to a grade label finally the flexibility in programming allows for easier implementation of curriculum improvements by individualizing the curriculum nongraded schools seek to abolish failure as an educational concept they also seek to accentuate success of course not all students will be successful in achieving their academic goals but their attempts are placed within a proper achievementability content several studies indicate that nongraded schools are more effective than graded schools in raising a students selfesteem and maintaining it at a high level even after unsuccessful task efforts despite positive evaluation the larger school systems remain curious but cautious about nongrading chicago and detroit public schools for example have only recently decided to try nongrading on a limited basis at the elementary level however most large school systems appear to be neither curious nor cautious and are clinging to their graded programs in addition to its limited use and evaluation in large urban schools the foremost disadvantages of the nongraded system are report cards and community reluctance nongraded schools have not found an optimum solution to the marking problem they are still trying to design report cards that will properly reflect how the students level of achievement compares with others in the system how the student stands in relation to his own ability and how the student compares with others in the group perhaps the foremost disadvantage of the nongraded system is the fact that it deviates from current educational practices severing the umbilical cord of traditionalism is sometimes disastrous to break through the comforts associated with the status quo and to bring about change causes a cry from most individuals who have conceived and nurtured the graded system in chicago and detroit for example when first introduced many parents claimed that they could not understand the basic philosophy of nongraded schools teachers threw up their arms in despair at being trained to teach in such a system educators of teachers were slow to advocate methods or philosophy of nongrading and taxpayers resented the use of public funds to experiment with their youth but beneath the vocal din and scholastic subterfuge is the fear of the unknown most americans do not mind jumping on a bandwagon if it is moving few school districts want to be the pilot or experiment to test the merits of nongrading in almost the same tone as the antinegro question of would you want your daughter to marry one community leaders study nongraded plans and look at each other asking would you want your child to attend one the better bridge builders as a bit of academic hindsight it seems easier for a social practitioner to criticize an existing educational institution than to objectively analyze it and then if needed offer practical alternatives for achieving more effectiveness it is even more difficult for him to criticize his stated alternatives the latter task is psychologically disconcerting it highlights the gaps between social theory and social practice and equally important it reminds the social practitioner of his own inadequacies yet of all the changeagents action researchers or social engineers have built the sturdiest bridges between social theory and social practice bridging the gap between educational theory and practice requires a knowledge of the past an appreciation for the present and a projected awareness of the future to state merely that our school system should shift from graded programs to nongraded programs is to overestimate the value of nongraded programs and to underestimate the value of graded programs nongraded schools should not be viewed as being completely new bridges for socializing students but instead as being significantly improved bridges there was a time when vocational training remedial classes and cultural enrichment programs were called drastically new approaches to formal education quickly and correctly educators reminded us that these innovations evolved out of an existing system when viewed in this manner education is in a continual state of change thus nongraded schools become a means to better education and not better education in itself traditional education some critics claim is not even adequate for traditional or normal students therefore when forced to educate nontraditional students such as lowerincome negro students the graded system shakes as if beseiged with delirium tremens following an examination of the system its custodians fail to provide it with the much needed corrective surgery which according to most studies would kill the system in the meantime the system continues to hobble along causing students to drop out or to graduate without inculcating needed basic skills gradually cases are being made to declare the graded system educationally incompetent in addition the taxpayers are being asked to give educators the power of attorney to commit it to the past in hearing the testimony local communities must decide if the graded system is guilty and must be put away for the good of society or if it is not guilty and can continue its efforts to socialize students if the verdict is guilty counsel for the defense of graded schools probably will ask for a suspended sentence and an opportunity to undergo rehabilitation treatments social scientists and educators speaking as amicus curiae do not recommend trying to rehabilitate the graded schools their evidence leans heavily towards implementing nongraded programs with deliberate speed the diversified needs of all students particularly the povertystricken call for this greatly improved approach to education yet it is a reality of community organization that it will take a while before many communities accept and commit resources to nongraded schools in the interim period the students suffer an even more sobering conclusion was drawn by august kerber and wilfred smith in educational issues in a changing society if we were to imagine the traditional school system as a personalization we would find an old man with a heavy load suffering and creaking at the joints harassed by spectators and even wellwishers at all sides and confused by opposing bits of advice this of course is an oversimplification yet even the ideal school system in our society is filled with all kinds of problems the strange fact is that education manages to keep going summary since our culturally disadvantaged students must compete in a basically middleclass oriented society they should be prepared for such competition few educators will disagree with this premise the major disagreement comes out of a quest for the best means of educating disadvantaged students there are those who would argue that nongraded schools are artificial systems which merely delay the time when the disadvantaged student will compete in a lifelike situation following this line of reasoning nongraded schools are both pretentious and dysfunctional for middleclass survival but perhaps the most frequent argument against nongraded education is that disadvantaged children do not need special curricula only more of the traditional curricula and for a longer period of time on the other hand reminiscent of a political slogan a few educators are beginning to chant that it is time for a change like alice in wonderland they are beginning to realize that culturally disadvantaged students must keep running just to keep up the changes most frequently suggested are those which would bend or break the grade lockstep by providing for students who need special assistance in small classes who need more emphasis on basic skills who have average ability and who are above average nongraded proponents believe that their system is best suited for meeting societal and individual needs despite its merits the nongraded system has flaws the basic issue then becomes can we as a nation afford not to try new approaches to education which may allow disadvantaged students to enter the mainstream of democratic life if the answer is no then we should encourage our school boards to give nongrading a fair trial and evaluation in all the analyses postmortems and search for causes conducted in los angeles after the watts riots there has been a solid reluctance to admit that the local events foretell changes for the negro in america the attempt to explain that violence entirely in terms of local conditions not only ignores changes within the national negro community but actually obstructs a real understanding of those changes the watts riots represent a marked and obvious shift in attitude among negroes in los angeles and given the recent history of the negro it follows that from los angeles there stem national implications thus it becomes immaterial whether watts is or is not a slum area whether criminal elements were or were not responsible for the rioting or whether police brutality did or did not occur the important thing is how negroes are beginning to regard what they at least see as facts and this new attitude is by no means confined to los angeles the change is based on shifts in the negros overall power position from the expanded use of the vote has come political power the negro has made his purchasing power felt in certain locales and his consumption pattern has affected the national market in some key commodities and the unrelenting civil_rights movement has brought domestic advances in the negros broad social position in addition to moral advantages acquired through a sympathetic world opinion as a result he is learning about the rewards of bargaining in the american way of life but the favorable shifts in the negros position have given him only a taste of the tangy flavor of power wielding its weaponsthe vote boycotts nonviolent demonstrationshe glimpses an even larger arsenal of possible weapons these alternative weapons and strategies increase his bargaining position if he can make violence work as an alternative to peaceful demonstration he seems willing to try it the northern parallel of the negroes with guns experiment in north carolina louisiana and mississippi showed itself in watts last august where peaceful weapons do not operate violence is an alternative and though this may come as a surprise to a public almost surfeited with reports of victory in the war for civil_rights the peaceful weapons were doing little for watts i came home to watts after two years abroad a week before the riots began during the years away i had read much about the quickening pace of the civil_rights movement and upon my return i was eager to see what changes had been made i was soon let down the dismal sameness of the neighborhood disturbed me most watts had not a new building the community issues which were old two years ago were now traditional police brutality was still alleged by a persistent few and just as emphatically denied by an official few on first appearance it seemed not only that watts had been spectator to whatever impact the civil_rights movement was making on the negro community but also that it did not in the slightest share the dazzling growth of the los angeles area watts seemed passive neither swinging with the new progressive ethos of the civil_rights movement nor enriching itself by way of the southern california bonanza it was i thought the same watts i had known as a boy to grow up in watts then was to have no especial pride in the community it was a physical locale and a habit of thought that one was expected to outgrow local heroes moved away went to the westside and seldom were heard from again when i graduated from high school and was preparing to leave for college my advisers told me that if people asked where i was from i should say south los angeles not watts anyone aspiring to success in the outside world was expected to dissociate himself from watts nothing good was ever known of watts it was in the news only as the scene of a knifing or shooting and in watts no boyhood dream was complete unless it included some kind of deliverance from the burdensome stigma the important differences between that old watts and the watts of today began to emerge for me during a conversation before the riots with a high school classmate who had preceded me to college we had always thought alike but now after the intervening years we seemed separated by our different experiences he talked about conditions in the city for afroamericans as he called negroes and said that he thought there were more important things than a home and fine car he was concerned that i should always remember my beginnings in watts and reminded me of his own experiences after college though a successful student he was never hired in the field of his academic specialty disappointed he joined the army and there suffered an injury that has left him slightly crippled soon after the injury he was discharged and later he married he is still jobless the ordeal has left him embittered at one time active in the civil_rights movement he now pays it little attention most of his friendly relations with white civil_rights workers have been severed he is indifferent to integration yet matters having to do with race interest him now even more than they did two years ago what now concerns him is the selfsufficiency of the negro community after the riots he called to express his satisfaction but regretted that the riots had stopped too short the true history of watts is the evolution of a negro community and it thus makes better sense to discuss the los angeles riots within the context of the negro in america than as a part of the civil_rights movement for watts like the larger community may be affected by the movement but it is nevertheless an entity apart from the movement it has absorbed some of the achievements of the drive for civil_rights and repelled others discarding the civil_rights framework in order to explain the riots may appear ironic but in fact the separation between the negro community and the civil_rights movement is easily discernible the real irony of the situation is that the successes of the movement are often mistakenly seen as satisfying some condition of the negro community when to the dismay of many the recent riots followed on the heels of the passage of the voting rights act the comment frequently made was you give these people this great piece of legislation and what do they do they go out and riot it doesnt make good sense but the civil_rights movement and the voting rights act are one thing the negro community and the riots are quite another hence the riots cannot be discussed in terms of the old language the cause advances setbacks cannot explain the changes the riots introduced a new language it is hardly intelligible to anyone outside the negro community some evidences of the vocabulary of the new language can be gleaned from the tone of current negro literature the fire hi ext time negroes with guns are recent titles that have meaning in the new context the language is bitter and it smacks of desperate conduct and action yet even worse the nations ear is not trained to recognize it for the first time los angeles heard from a littleknown black man a kind of gnome he was a recluse in watts a negro qua negro silent invisible and until now always passive most of the time he has been the object of somebody elses action relentlessly acted upon when he met whites they were usually in a uniformthat of a policeman or a businessmansignifying some role antagonistic to the community it was no accident that the riots chose the police and the merchants as their targets initially it was an incident with policemen that provoked the riots but the policemans presence is always at issue he comes to the negro community to impose a legal order so incompatible with its style of life and patterns of conduct as to make it seem that he is imposing an alien civil code the charge often made that protests against police brutality are just a convenient cover up for a prevailing civic irresponsibility ignores the fact that the law and its agents reflect the dominant american mode of life and that the negro as a community is excluded from fully participating in that dominant mode so the law that appears to be a form of order for the largest sectors of the population is in fact an inconvenience and a burden when applied to negroes unlike the policeman whose presence is constant the merchant confines his activities in watts to business hours the merchant was damned not so much for his unethical dealingsto be sure the merchants are no more unethical in watts than they are anywhere elsebut ironically enough for his strict application of the american business ethic to watts in particular watts has been made an exception to the rules of the larger community but few allowances for the difference are ever made with respect to business it is hardly recognized that business practices appropriate to wilshire beverly hills and other sections of los angeles are in nowise suitable to watts the merchant righteously tells his customer in watts that his treatment is no different from the treatment of customers at the store across town the fallacy in this pitch to the negro customer is so obvious that it rarely goes unnoticed if the merchant is to do business in watts the terms of his relationship with the customer must be keyed to the individual pocketbooks of the local citizens examples abound in watts of goods being reclaimed and payroll checks being attached after a customer has failed on a single monthly payment negroes recognize the subtle alternating pattern of partiality with impartiality and they talk about it the watts riots were an assertion in still another direction in addition to expelling the white presence they created and exposed new reactions of the negro to himself the traditional roles were switched the negro was in the active role for the first time doing the chasing and wreaking the havoc to a people who have always been acted upon rarely doing anything for itself or to communities outside the riots were a bold departure from a long tradition of inertia admittedly the fact that the activity was destructive is not irrelevant but it is less important than the fact that rioting is for the negro in watts a form of expression no one understands his problem or bothers to care few of his local leaders have the imagination or vision to articulate his special feelings to the outside world besides it is the kind of story most americans will protest that they would rather not hear there in watts the negro is trapped and without a means of expressing himself or of making himself understood to the environment that surrounds him because of the inadequacy of the avenues open to him he resorts in desperation to rioting what seemed like a sudden reaction to his plight had in fact been developing in the negro all along it was sudden only in its manifestation by his relegation to watts the negro is forced to be conscious of the differences that place him there the isolation serves to accentuate his awareness of his homogeneity and it follows from this that the negro resolves most of the differences that relegate and isolate him into one unique differencethat of race to this race consciousness the negro attaches many thingsthe sum of his reactions to this world we all live in and to himself as the world about us changes to be sure the reactions he derives from this race consciousness are not consistently rational but then what human reactions are consistently rational to be a negro and aware of its serves as an organizing mechanism that simplifies many things for him explains why certain other things happen just to him and no one else and gives to him a justification not only for reacting differently but for acting differently as well the importance of the los angeles riots lies in the fact that it was the first time in watts that race consciousness has been a basis for acting previously the consciousness had been present but always passive it was a basis solely for understanding what was done to the negro on racial grounds what minuscule action race consciousness did take as in organizations that adhered to racist doctrines was more important as reaction to the black mans special predicament on most busy street corners in the neighborhood one could buy a paper and read about the negros new and growing awareness of himself but for the most part it was confined to newsprint and the muslim temple that it has now exploded in racial violence only reinforces and heightens the race consciousness the attempt to dispel it comes too late while the rioting lasted it divided the city into two very obvious camps but the intense race consciousness that was manifested during the riots has not been erased now that the riots have ended it lives on in internalized forms in new images and new possibilities there is a tragedy in the new prospect it is sure to make future relations between the negro community and the city somewhat strained at a time when both communities could profit by increased understanding of each other the distance that separated whites from negroes before the riots is even greater today the very understanding the negro solicits by rioting is barred by the effects of that rioting in an attempt to explode myths he has only magnified them by resorting to violence that traditional mode of human expression he has made future expression and communication more difficult the problem of communication is not new indeed the aftermath of the rioting showed how vast the communication gap has always been for one thing the news media lacked proper resources one of the major metropolitan dailies had to hire its negro advertising agent to cover the area because it had no negroes on the reporting staff a national magazine with offices in los angeles nevertheless had no coverage for two full days because there was no one in the local office who could enter the riot area also the news media were wholly without the experience to deal with the negro population after the riots had ended watts was practically overrun by press tv and radio in search of the facts but these media could find no reliable sources of information it was apparent that most of the reporters were going about the task of covering the riot area in total darkness the lack of facilities and techniques for communication may have added to the difficulties many of the published facts about the riots were not even approximately true most outsiders simply could not distinguish between forms the lack of experience with watts led to gross generalizing for example most officials outside concluded that there was no leadership in watts and this may be sufficient as far as the outside community is concerned but they fail to realize that the citizenry of watts is not a flock watts too is a community and therefore its leadership takes a variety of forms there are political leaders business leaders religious leaders et al whereas in the large community the leadership resides most often in business executives and professionals the same kind of leadership in watts falls to the barber the auto mechanic the bartender it is not so much that leadership does not exist but that the indigenous leadership takes forms which are largely unintelligible to those unfamiliar with the community pattern the same social factors that make the law seem alien and the business practices unfair can account for the outsiders failure to discover leadership in watts the problem in communication now is not so much a lack of interest in obtaining information it is rather one of dealing skillfully with an unfamiliar community riots in los angeles and the threat of riots elsewhere should serve to remind the nation of the negros growing restlessness the sad facts of the los angeles story indicate that violence can easily occur in all the big cities of the north and the problems are exceedingly difficult for it is impossible to deal with the negro as though he were something other than himself to expect the negro to become white in his thinking is to expect too much understanding can proceed only if there is a firm recognition of genuine differences a failure to recognize the differences and to understand what they mean to the negro will inevitably lead to more riots the tragedy of the rj r american negro is i t not at e s black in jv a white mans country but rather its the fact that he is helplessly trapped in a fantasy land of torment and terror a land which persists in trying to control everyone everywhere but merely succeeds in corrupting and destroying everything it touches conceived in genocide and slavery and now dedicated to the proposition that its ordained mission is to rule the world or act as world policeman as the daily press so quaintly phrases it america has now marked itself the thug of the th century by its wanton murder of unarmed peoples in distant lands who hardly knew this country existed let alone had any intention of dropping one pebble on its soil and needless to say this criminal attitude of total disregard for the legal and human rights of other peoples is making the white american detested in every corner of the world then counterpoised to this public spectacle of escalating horror is the private chaos resulting from the vicious subterranean battle waged by americas brainwashed overeducated white women who are made to live in a state of virtual servitude by their insecure racehating warmongering men folk and caught beneath these eternally clashing forces the negro is like a man tied to a sinking ship who has the option of going down with everyone else or breaking his chains and leaping overboard into the unknown uncharted waters yet up till this very moment with but few exceptions our leaders have constantly told us we must prepare ourselves so we will be ready to move into the mainstream when the time is ripe and it is exactly at this point that they betray themselves and this brings us to the second tragic aspect of the afroamerican his leaders speak for the oppressor knowingly or otherwise we are never asked if we want to move into the mainstream for due to the incredibly egotistical nature of the white man he has always assumed that all black folk are simply champing at the bit waiting for that glorious day when his benign white brother will reach out his hand and say come i welcome you at ast into my promised land and this is why the late malcolm_x and the black muslims are so despised by white america malcolm and the muslims dared to say what an everincreasing number of afroamericans have long yearned to say the white man be damned i want no part of him and his evil ways for who indeed in his right mind wants to move into americas polluted mainstream where every man woman and child stand neck deep in some one elses blood the stench here is as stilling as any that ever came from a german concentration camp only the sound is muffled but let us suppose for a moment that we should consider following that lets get ready advice how do we prepare ourselves to enter the modern house of horror that is america today obviously and of utmost importance we must learn to forego the pleasures of petty thievery no more this business of grabbing a loaf of bread and a few ham hocks and running for which we always receive ten or fifteen years when caught and we are always apprehended we never benefit from any of that cant finditis luck which always seem to befall white folk when they have victimized us from here on in we must play it the way the mainstreamers do work out a system we must plan our deviltry with premeditation and in great complicated detail so we can abscond with millions a la the bank tellers the salad oil boys the billie sol estes the teapot domers the dixon yates the bobby bakers the five percenters and the price fixers etc then too we must stop all this tomfoolery of bushwhacking each other in the future we must band together and blow up their churches and sunday schools in session and play target practice with their passing motorists and lurk in the darkened bushes and shoot their unsuspecting men and women and children in the back and then we must be prepared to sit on hung juries so we can let us go free and then give ourselves our profound congratulations for being so so white and in addition to this subtle warfare at home we must now learn how to wage allout war on foreign soil in the name of peace and democracy the first and most urgent lesson to learn here is that we must accuse them of aggression while we test our flame throwers our napalm bombs and other horror weapons on their women and children and no matter how far from home we are or how many cities and villages we wreck or how many people we blow to bits we must always remember to shout in righteous indignation those people must be taught that we will not budge an inch until they learn how to live in peace with their neighbors then when they have learned this lesson we will rebuild all their bridges all their hospitals and roads and villages and homes and schools and all their everything except the people we have incinerated but we mustnt let a little thing like that bother us because after all they werent like us you know and war is hell and besides look how it strengthened our economy another cardinal rule we must remember to adhere to at all times whether home or abroad is to bump off anybody we cant buy or anybody we no longer have any need of and then finally and foremost if we are ever to really make it big in the mainstream we must remember that at all times and at all costs we simply must keep the nigger down if you dont keep both feet on him day and night he will always take a little bit more and a little bit more until the next thing you know hes living next door and marrying our sister now that we have the magic formula for becoming a mainstreamer theres only one question left who is going to be our nigger but i should think the answer to that is as plain as day the black folk still stuck in the ghetto will be the black mainstreamers nigger of tomorrow to be sure more than one cani did observer of the american scene has noted that this nation has always been controlled by an elite group and never was this more true than it is today and obviously this elite group has historically been white males of anglosaxon origin the anglosaxon origin has given way somewhat under heavy pressure but the white male continues to rule this country in the same old fashion of granting preferential privilege to a select few and the overwhelming majority of white women in america are so brainwashed and so afraid that someone will label them masculine if they stop shouting the praises of their lifelong state of semivoluntary servitude to the male that they have become even more insistent than the white male that the nigger must be kept in his place imagine their consternation conscious or otherwise when they finally get the message that that equality business was meant for males white only that the female must remain a subservient subsidiary at all times and especially if she marries in which case she will even have to give up her own identity and follow the ageold slave custom of adopting the masters name and not only must she serve her husband hand and foot night and day but she must also loudly acclaim the neverending joy of such servitude now such a role may not be so onerous for some female who had trouble making it out of kindergarten but for these bright bas and phds who shout such rot nowadays its really not unlike watching a game of russian roulette unfolding for sooner or later the big game comes one such bang is the many mamas boys these bright serfs turn out which was so ably described in the feminine mystique by betty friedan some two years ago now the point where we are directly concerned in all this business is that so many of these inferior housewives vent their frustrations on the most convenient underdog they can find the afroamerican it isnt mere coincidence that in both the north and the south so many white women have made such tenacious efforts to keep the schools and neighborhoods segregated and just where did you think all those little old ladies in tennis shoes came from these insecure housewives realize all too clearly that if the negro gains his freedom they will be the only serfs left in this vast wasteland and in addition these same women having no life of their own inasmuch as they have been divested of their inalienable right to be free individuals rob their children and their husbands of their sense of self and peace of mind thus we see middleclass teenagers wrecking america in a far more prodigious manner than any black slum kid could ever hope to do and their fathers the men who rule the nation are so harried and unsure of themselves thanks to their dispossessed nagging women that not only are they dead set against ever letting the black man rise but these same men of power must constantly prove their manhood in any manner they can and usually in the easiest way by kicking the downtrodden further down for a grim example both arthur m schlesinger and theodore c sorensen have come up with sad afterthoughts concerning their part in the bay of pigs fiasco during john f kennedys presidency in his book a thousand days john f kennedy in the white house schlesinger called the invasion a terrible idea and reproached himself for not having protested more strenuously at the time while sorensen wrote in his book kennedy concerning that illfated episode that unfortunately among those privy to the plan in both the state department and the white house doubts were entertained but never pressed partly out of fear of being labeled soft or undaring in the eyes of their colleagues and he went on to point out that kennedy too feared that cancellation of the invasion would make him look soft at home and abroad he felt that his disapproval of the plan would be a show of weakness inconsistent with his general stance newsweek august and one bright day these same insecure men or men like them are apt to find themselves in a situation involving the bomb and in order to save face and look strong they may just as casually blow up the world and wont those brainwashed white women be surprised when they find that after all these years of proclaiming my place is in the home the home is going to be the first place blasted off the map when americas bombs come to roost idney poitier millions of people know that name it belongs to the only negro ever to win an academy award as a leading man in a hollywood motion picture that in itself is a pachydermatous accomplishment but even more it is a stupendous victory in the negros struggle for human justice poitier as any movie fan knows won his oscar for his outstanding portrayal of an itinerant worker for a group of poor foreign nuns in the film lilies of the field however there are those who claim that he was only good not great in the film and that he received the coveted award principally because of the times and not because of his talents they are dead wrong about his talent but they are right about the social climate it cannot be denied that the negro quest for civil_rights reached a pinnacle in it also stands uncontradicted that in the sixtyodd years of cinema the images of negroes on screen have been changingfrom fools to comedians to integral characters and now heroic protagonists still there is much to be desired of all the negro actors and actresses in this country only a handful have been featured in integrated pictures and in those instances their roles have been limited to segregation themes it is to poitiers credit that he has somehow managed to cast off the psychological chains that bind negroes to certain ethnic parts in films his success quite possibly could revolutionize the entire movie making industry for the moment however hollywood continues to follow a policy of white makes right this absurdity is manifested either in flagrant racism or in the utter ignoring of the negros existence so much so the industry has been under constant attack from the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp and the congress of racial equality core and as of late some of the big white stars themselves in addition numerous resolutions have been adopted calling for an end to negro stereotyping as well as an end to discriminatory practices by the trade unions talent guilds and other agencies until studios and producers for years had stalled the efforts of negroes to obtain a semblance of equal opportunity in hollywood each year there were meetings between the parties involved but nothing ever came of them a few jobs as extras opened up for some negroes in b movies but the craft unions continued their closed shop policy finally the naacp stepped in and vowed to boycott theatres all across the country if action was not taken immediately the moguls not wanting to be hit where it hurts the mostin the pocketbookbegan a frantic search for negro talent no longer were there scenes of city streets or subways where there was not a single negro in sight moreover two negroes wendell franklin and otis greene were picked off for executive posts on two major projects franklin served as an assistant director for the film the greatest story ever told still to be released and greene was an assistant to producer james fonda on screen gems hazel series the target show of the naacps demand for more movie jobs at the time greene was quoted as saying that work available to negro actors had increased tenfold and he was right only thats like saying that a firm with one negro on its staff which then hires an other has increased its negro personnel some per cent discrimination is still a way of life in hollywood for instance there were negroes listed by central casting corporation in during all of and the first part of that figure was increased to the grand total of central an agency of the motion picture producers association has whites on its roles and orientals in the craft unions a training program has been instituted for all apprentice aspirants regardless of race but according to a spokesman for mppa the program is in its infancy and has very few unions under its wing this has led the naacp to threaten decertification proceedings by appealing directly to the national labor relations board one such target is the international association of theatrical stage employes iatse with which the unions are affiliated meanwhile iatse steadfastly insists that it does not practice discrimination but produces no figures to prove it and so it goes hollywoods discrimination against negroes remains for the most part true to tradition compounded upon a premise which by its very nature is not only bad but normally unjust that premise is comprised of many parts including union discrimination the southern shuffle restrictions imposed by financiers and ignorance the southern shuffle perhaps more than any of the others is responsible for the negros plight where movies are concerned film after film following the turn of the century specialized in maligning ridiculing and disparaging the race not only were the true hopes and ambitions of the negro suppressed but the characterizations of negroes as given were the vilest of caricatures the most odious stereotypes purposely drawn to show the negro as a brainless idiot and how they succeeded howls of laughter were heard from movie houses when the characters rastus and sambo were introduced to the nation while the disfranchisement and segregation of the negro was carried out at the same time it was a hideous crime but like murder in mississippi and chicago too it went unsolved the trend of negro treatment on the screen took a sharp turn in the years between and unfortunately it wasnt for the best uncle tomism came into being then such trash as for massas sake in slavery days and the debt spewed from the soundless studios uncle toms cabin itself appeared during those years but instead of the scathing indictment of slavery that its author harriet beecher stowe wanted it to be the movie became a disgraceful display of subservient loyalty then came d w griffiths birth of a nation termed a classic by some it aided and abetted bigots who for obvious reasons saw fit to perpetuate hatred between negroes and whites a former president of the us woodrow wilson lauded the film and reportedly said it is like writing history with lighting the new york times said it is by far the greatest motion picture work yet put forward variety stated birth of a nation is a new milestone in film artistry a great epoch in picture making but if the movie was a heavensent depiction to whites it was a hellridden falsehood to negroes nearly all viewed it as simply gross propaganda aimed at glorifying the outlawed and disgraced kukluxklan a storm of protest arose when the film was initially released and many theatres banned itfor a whilein several northern states yet the effectiveness of the picture is best seen by the fact that in there were some kkk members throughout the united states from that time until after the second world war the hollywood scene as related to the negro people remained just about the same but in came a wave of darkie interest films the first fulllength production was a war vehicle entitled home of the brave it was followed by lost boundaries pinky and intruder in the dust while they did not lean towards uncle tomism and lowlife comedy as represented by willie best stepin fetchit and mantan moreland they nevertheless were symbols of segregation at the time that they were made there was not one negro writer producer director technical direc tor or camera man listed as a guild member what is even worse very few negroes resided in hollywood and they for the most part were maids and butlers as for a negro becoming a star well that was out of the question that is until poitier arrived whereas the studios would spend thousands upon thousands of dollars building the white actor or actress into a star they spent nothing on the negro personality obviously the star system was built on color and black was not the in color it is well to note that it was stanley kramer producer of home of the brave who added a touch of racial maturity to hollywood by casting poitier opposite tony curtis in the defiant ones the year was and by then it had become politically possible to star a negro in an integrated movie still it would be five years later before poitier would be given a role which called for a top flight actor irrespective of race creed or color from all that has transpired since then it would seem that sidney has it made in movies this is hardly the case his roles will continue to be hand picked if for no other reason than miscegenation and for hollywood that is a dirty word out there race mixing is only for real lifenot the screen this malady is typified by the attitude towards the interracial movie one potato two potato turned down as a selection for the cannes film festival by the u s motion picture export association the producers of the movie larry peerce and jack weston had to visit a horde of european sources before they could get their work distributed in cannes a french selection committee readily agreed to show the film and it received widespread acclaim the female lead barbara barrie won the best actress award for her performance there potato told the story of a man who had left his wife and child to go to south america in his absence his wife divorced him returning four years later he discovered his wife had married a negro bernie hamilton so he sued for custody of the child contending that the child could not have a normal upbringing in an interracial marriage he won out of course this honest film was an independent production and thats hollywood today sidney poitier may be like a pair of brand new shoes to the movie colony but the same old feet are in them the movie industry remains like most of americas institutionsby for and about white people hugh h smythe a trjr skinny kid from the

kids if the kids react to you youve got it made once you have the kids on your side their parents know you cant be all bad kids react well to me and then smythe adds with a chortle kids and dogs the above lines from coleridges kubla khan are about as insignificant a passage of poetry as youll find like music they are singular and selfjustifying conveying nothing at all outside of the images they invoke they are an example chosen at random of what susan sontag refers to as the sensuous surface of artart as ritual as incantation independent of any social moral or even psychological obligation in against interpretation the noonday press the noted contributor to such magazines as commentary the nation and partisan review presents a brilliant defense of this aspect of creativity and a convincing argument against traditional approaches to literary criticism interpretation as miss sontag sees it is not an absolute value rather it must itself be evaluated within the context of history and culture in our own milieu with its hyperthropy of the intellect criticism is becoming increasingly impertinent to the stated product increasingly a shadow world of freud christian precept and contemporary social theory that bears little relationship to the creative genesis to treat works of art in this fashion is not wholly irrelevant but it is obviously putting art to use such treatment has little to do with what actually takes place when a person possessing some training and sensibility looks at a work of art miss sontag attributes the problem to what she calls the erroneous separation of form from content creating the illusion of values outside the stated work which is essentially formal indeed practically all metaphors for style amount to placing matter on the inside style on the outside it would be more to the point to reverse the metaphor as cocteau writes decorative style has never existed style is the soul and unfortunately for us the soul assumes the form of the body indeed contends the author in what adds up to a repudiation of the entire tradition of criticism as set by aristotle the sense in which a work of art has no content is not different from the sense in which the world has no content both are and while allowance is made for a twin function of art content is merely the pretext the lure which engages the consciousness in an essentially formal process of transfiguration this is how we can in good conscience cherish works of art which considered in terms of content are morally objectionable to us to illustrate this last point miss sontag cites gide proust joyce mallarme but she finds a broader example for her argument in contemporary drama and in the avantgarde cinema particularly the cinema that ultimate proponent of art as magic when cocteau in orpheus has his actors leap through mirrors it is like ritual a visual affirmation of the impossible similarly bresson the diary of a priest etc does not intend his characters to be implausible im sure but he does i think intend them to be opaque godard and antonioni employ ideas but less as content than as decor props sensual material and even the films of bergman though crammed with lame messages about the modern spiritstill triumph over the pretentious intentions of their director not surprisingly miss sontag scores a plus for the new wave of french writers nathalie sarraute alain robbegrillet etc mainly for their attention to the purely visual aspects of experience but she criticizes the novel at large in its antiquity of form in its failure to acknowledge the preeminence of form as the most reactionary of the modern art media traditional criticism contends the author in its demand for significance at the expense of energy and sensual capability is the revenge of the intellect upon art even more it is the revenge of the intellect upon the world for art like the world is basically an aesthetic phenomenonhamilton bims an old propaganda adage is repetition is a form of emphasis in a very real sense we have been bombarded with the most emphatic kind of propaganda possible on harlema ghetto exceptionally prolific in inspiring writers sociologists pamphleteers etc gilbert osofsky joins this long line with harlem the making of a ghetto harper and row he must be aware of the hordes of his predecessors because he has done an exceptional job of research and he must have felt that his book would make a contribution toward a better understanding of harlem in a sense his book does make a contribution it is one of the better documented works and reflects the kind of massive research he did making his collection of harlemtonia a scholars work much of the substance however is rather commonly known to negroes and to others who have any interest in harlem andor negro big city ghettos using certain problems he does show dramatically how little things have changed for example in charles dickens visited the negro slums of new york and wrote women and men slink off to sleep forcing the dislodged rats to move away we know that one of the principal fears today of the harlem mother is that her child will be bitten by rats during the night in the new freeman stated the present housing conditions of the vast majority of colored families in new york can only be characterized as disgraceful mr osofsky thus underlines that the problems are not new we are also aware that these conditions could not exist in america if authority and the power structure did not either condone or ignore them osofsky helps enforce this point by describing how policemen literally got rich in the viceridden negro section of new york policemen preferred to work there it was said to get their share of underworld graft a means of reprimanding a disobedient officer was to move his beat from the vice areas he quotes lest it be thought only the rank and file were involved he goes on anyone who was captain of the district the negro section a year could live on tenderloin steaks the rest of his life in his comprehensive research osofsky even investigated negro blues and folk songs of the era involved one of which contains perhaps the most meaningful statement of thingsthen and now it goes now i started at the bottom and i stays there dont seem like im gonna get nowhere in those days it was called the blues today that feeling is called poverty mentality whatever it is called doesnt obscure the fact that it is unnecessary unchristian undemocratic and unamerican perhaps if men like osofsky repeat the message often enough and loud enough then the blues song times gonna bring about a change will become a realitybrooks johnson africa before they came william morrow company by galbraith welch is very like prospecting for gold in sierra madre its arduous dry and uphill but the reader is rewarded often enough with nuggests of semiprecious information about some of africas golden ages that he keeps on another incentive is the wit and humor that is often woven into the fabric of the book and on occasions it is spiced with rather interestingly risque overtones this is not to convey the notion that this is a sexy book but to the extent that the author liberally goes into the personal lives of some of our great heroes and heroines like solomon and sheba the book does cover interesting sex angles but further the author is quite eager to point out the role that the weaker sex has played in the colorful african epoch this is to cover areas where the sexual prejudices of other historians prevented them from giv ing women their fair credit in african history while she makes a pointed effort to overcome some of the basic prejudices of her male counterparts in their treatment or rather nontreatment of women she heiself falls drey to one of the historians oldest prejudices that is she appears to be prone to go into great detail about the glamor glory and marvels of africa of the sahara but africa south of the sahara is usually relegated to a few paragraphs at the end of a chapter when topics common to the two africas were discussed there are several possible reasons for this treatment other than prejudice of course its probably true that information comes easier from africa of the sahara because in so many ways it is intellectually and physically more accessible but before a book such as the one mrs welch attempts to write can really reach its potential these handicaps must be objectively and effectively overcomebrooks johnson no time for tears johnson publishing company is both frightening and inspirational frightening because it relates a series of tragedies befalling one woman any one of which could have been crippling and which combined should have been fatal it is horrifying to think that one woman katheryn patterson experienced a broken home chronic illness culminating in epilepsy was a school dropout and when she seemed almost to have surmounted these obstacles and within sight of happiness a son was born to her who was hydrocephalic such pressures would seem enough to crush the hardiest but the resiliency of the human spirit is a truly amazing phenomenon and nowhere is it better displayed than in the case of mrs patterson the purpose of tragedy can be one of inspiration after reading her story one is likely to wonder is there really any justice in life the answer is provided by the fact that her family recovered from its misfortune and without maudlin selfpity found enough courage to lead as normal a life as circumstances would allow there is something inspirational and fulfilling about the manner in which delbert patterson her husband had the compassion understanding and fortitude to give her the necessities for overcoming her own individual problems and it is moving to learn how she in turn was able to pass these precious gifts on to her afflicted son the book eschews sympathysob prose and is told in a matter of fact fashion allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions it is fast reading simply told and worth the telling from time to time we are all prone to feel life has singled us out for a particularly nasty blow perhaps a book like this could serve as a point of reference to set the record straight againbrooks johnson in the foreward to his autobiography go up for glory coward mccann bill russell says i have fought in every way i know how i fought because i believed it was right to fight i think that no man should fear the consequences because every man must do that which he believes is right with a bit of hip literary drama so do a slow dissolve baby as they say in the movies into black russell takes you all the way back to monroe louisiana where he was born in where the black begins where he first discovered he had to fight the road stretches from the childhood in monroe and then oakland california the high school where most of the teachers were a negative influence on the negro students to the university of san francisco where he spearheaded two national championship teams to the olympics where he saw politics in action and on to the boston celtics and the loneliest life in the world bill russell maintains that he is a basketball player by accident and he calls his profession a childs game the accident perhaps is that he grew much taller than most men and worked hard to develop the skills that enable him to make large sums of money for playing the childs game but bill russell approaches neither basketball nor life as a child his story naturally revolves around the world of professional basketball but his observations of the american scene from the special vantage point of superstarone of our bona fide needsshould interest those who do not know a jump shot from a rebound basketball fans will find russells nba insights fascinating but as the bearded rebel promises this is not the friendship diary of a typical american athlete who makes good there is much causticity in his comments on how the negro views the police the march on washington the compromising that has him disenchanted with the civil_rights movement and an array of other things that have nothing to do with locker rooms and jockey straps russells concern with manhood permeates the book fame so often the great distorter seems to have given bill russell a most implacable sense of priorities he calls success relative and is adamant in maintaining that life to him is something more than a popularity contest the book concludes in reading massachusettswhere he raises his family with russell questioning that his children should be called niggers and hoping that his and his countrymens children might be spared the battles he has had to fight but russell with an amazing ability to dismiss the superficial and reduce the fantasy to truth has indeed grown more than most men in more ways than one it is perhaps an accident that at he has written an autobiography but some accidents are worth happeningd llorens hilip sterlings laughing on the outside the intelligent white readers guide to negro tales and humor grosset dunlap is a collection which both white and negro readers will smile and laugh over in his introduction saunders redding says that the humor of the negro is rooted in social oppression and the book covers the period from ole massa and the plantation to mr charlie and the civil_rights movement although the book is short it is not one to read straight through but to dip into and browse in one may have heard some of the jokes before or read others in collections like hughes and bontemps the book of negro folklore but here they are printed without the broken dialect spelling and are easier to read while they retain their conversational negro tone there are many tales which speakers could use to make a point as lincoln and khrushchev used to do a young minister trying to make a good impression bounded into the pulpit and began to preach at the top of his voice the congregation didnt respond and his voice got weaker and weaker and he finally eased himself from the pulpit and said to the elder i dont think they liked my sermon the elder said if youd gone up like you came down you could have come down like you went up the last section of the book contains the written word by george schuyler web du bois harry golden alice childress ossie davis carl rowan langston hughes sterling brown and dick gregory petroleum v nasby describes how ole massa reacted to emancipation and st clair mckelway how mr and mrs charlie felt about their servants getting defense jobs cartoons by ollie harrington are interspersed through the book and his expressive drawing and robust humor demonstrate that he is one of the best american cartoonists a detailed table of contents and a long bibliography serve the readers convenience dudley randall opinions of the late malcolm_x were mostly formed from the knowledge available through mainstream news media and the relatively few occasions when malcolm appeared on the popular television panel shows the mainstream news media is a poor source for discovering truth and not even malcolm was cunning enough to outmanipulate the boys down at wkkktv or what have you hence very few of us understood the man or his mission as brother malcolm if i may liked to point out you catch hell because youre a black man and he was never really at home never fully at ease or at peace with himself except when standing before his people doing what he did besttelling them why they were catching hell and exactly who was giving them hell malcolm was an orator and the tv panels were not his shot a little publicized book malcolm_x speaks merit publishers provides a belated but much needed opportunity to understand the man moreover this selection of speeches and statements most of them taped during the final year of his life illuminates the dramatic sequel of events that led to his tragic death a sequel of events that remain to the public somewhat mysteriousquite like his death itself trial by jury notwithstanding through his words brother malcolm emerges as one obsessed by honesty unusual phenomenon determined to tell a little more truth about this country and this world each time he opened his handsome mouth he made no false claims in march he humbly stated i am not educated nor am i an expert in any particular fieldbut i am sincere and my sincerity is my credentials in an age of experts malcolm was a humanitarian who believed in people i for one spoke malcolm in december believe that if you give people a thorough understanding of what it is that confronts them and the basic causes that produce it theyll create their own program and when the people create a program you get action and malcolms mission was to bring about that action he spent his last year trying to give black americans an understanding of what confronts them and trying to impress them with the necessity of identifying not merely with civil_rights but with human rights malcolm knew that so long as his people refused to look beyond this nations borders so long as they were unable to relate to peoples struggling for freedom the world over there would be no vision though he said i am not educated indeed malcolm learned a great deal about the worlds economy and malcolm possessed rare vision it was in the audubon ballroom two months before he would meet his fate there that he spoke of america and europe controlling the worlds economy so as to keep other nations living at a low standard in plain language he told why america and europe have kept the nations of latin america africa and asia from becoming industrial powers these people are beginning to see said malcolm with reference to the poor nations as barbara ward has called them so when you hear them talking about freedom theyre not talking about a cup of coffee with a cracker no theyre talking about getting into a position to feed themselves and clothe themselves this is the way you and i have to understand the world revolution thats taking place right now in essence brother malcolm spent the last year of his life becoming a dangerous man black men are expected to protest against the system as malcolm had done earlier to be sure but black men are not expected to start messing with the system this book of speeches reveals that malcolm was messing with this mans as malcolm liked to call him system and this fact must be known if one is to understand what malcolm represented at the time of his death unlike the handful of black intellectuals with similar vision malcolm during his final year was discovering ways to communicate his vision to the black masses and he was terribly impatient when you and i are inside of america and look at america said malcolm in december she looks big and bad and invincible oh yes and when we approach her in that context we approach her as beggars with our hat in our hands if we understand whats going on in the world today and fit america into that context we find out that shes not so bad after all shes not very invincible they called him violent but like most revolutionaries brother malcolm was romantic and magnificently human when he spoke of the people his speech was marked with warmth and sensitivity and his admiration for those who battled for the peoplewhether in america africa china or whereverwas manifold to the end malcolm found honest alternatives to our constant lies and booming silence even though he probably knew it would lead to an earlv death malcolm_x speaks is a candid look at one who dared think in a nation that dared him to think black people once believed he was something horrible as white people promulged but if a black man reads this book and dares to think the only horror hell experience is the realization that the man we so desperately needed is no longer with usdavid llorens willard motleys posthumous novel let noon be fair putnams prompts the question asked by arna bontemps in anger and beyond in his discussion of jean toomers disappearance as a negro writer he says the behavior pattern known sociologically as passing for white then has its literary equivalent and the question it raises is whether or not this is proper in the arts like mr motlevs other novels this is not a book about negroes it is about white americans in mexico and their interaction with the mexicans yet although he does not write about negroes mr motley has the observant eye of the everpresent but invisible negro who sees the whites in their unguarded moments there is a sole negro character who is mentioned in only two or three sentences but there we feel motleys negro sensitivity to prejudice he tells how a selfappointed american official complained at the american embassy that one of his compatriots was a communist because she was seen talking to the negro the answer to mr bontemps question is that although mr motley writes of whites he has not copped out he sees them in their perversions drunkenness vulgarity idealism and lavishness with the objective ironical eye of a negro the mexican locale and characters raise a second question the question whether a writer from one culture can write convincingly of another in this mr motley seems to have succeeded i do not know mexico but the world of this novel is a coherent world mr motley writes of many characters but he does not stay long with any his method is panoramiche treats a character in a paragraph a page or several pages and then passes on to another character he is like a man setting tiles who seems to pick up the different colored pieces at random but who gradually forms a pattern we see the characters grow older have children die and we see their children mature the town of las casas grows from eight streets where almost everyone is poor but no one is hungry to a thriving resort where wealthy mexicans and americans vacation and children and professionals beg in the streets the mexicans leave their trades as fishermen and farmers and become cooks and waiters they learn the sexual deviations of the americans they learn to cheat them and to steal from them mr motley does not go inside the minds of his characters there is no psychologizing no symbolism but we get to know the characters as we learn to know our friends by their words and actions their words and actions are significant and so absorb us that it is hard to put the book down until it is finisheddudley randall the savage state by george conchon holt rinehardt winston is a translation of a book concerning life in a new african republic formerly under french rule the author is a former french secretary general of the central african republic it is suggested that because of his position he was able to see racism become a political issue a suggestion that implied racism became an issue after independence the fact of the matter is of course that racism had been an issue in africa before the white man and certainly remained a crucial and a basic political issue during his dominance and after it in a rather cumbersome fashion the story concerns a french couple first separated when the young wife runs away with another frenchman to africa where she leaves the second man in her life to live with an african minister of the new republic this tale is unfolded in a heavy manner which fails because the author forgot the old literary adage that which is worth saying is best stated in simple direct terms when he works with the attitudes and mannerisms of the ministers in their official surroundings the book lightens considerably this is also true of his descriptions of the heat and the scenery but leaving this for the characters the book generally loses plausibility in fairness to the author it should be stated that several of his characters are interesting but even they are sometimes difficult to believe a possible salvaging aspect of the book is the authors interesting dealing with the white masculine egos reaction to the choice of a white woman of a negro when there were attractive white men available disregarding the fact that the african is the second man the wife has been involved with since leaving her husband a young french officer in the republic to shape up the army tells the husband do something for gods sake show yourself worthy to be called a man get a move on this advice being ignored the officer says to a friend take him to bed and tuck him in hes a pansy this fellow beyond revealing how white men feel about their woman sleeping with negro men something negro men have known for some time the book at best is only relatively interesting this is unfortunate because the authors experiences prepared him for a much better effortbrooks johnson the street lights were turned off and the taxi carrying me from the airport crept cautiously through an abyss of candlelight and darkness people loomed like phantoms in the night and now and then came glimpses of the citya broken sidewalk a thatchedroof hut a shirtless cripple sitting on the ground a putrid smell permeated the alleys and now and then the wail of a beggar donnezmoi donnezmoi it was against this setting in the midst of this hell that i first viewed the presidents palace floodlit extravagant it sat mockingly in its little squarea defiant monument to greed cruelty and meglomania there are places in this world that transcend spatial limits and approach the realm of dream tibet they say is one of these as well as certain regions of the himalayas yet another though for social rather than physical reasons is the caribbean republic of haiti it is here in the dictator state of president francois duvallier that graham greene has set his latest novel the comedians viking and it is a case for a while anyway of fiction being just as strange as truth through much of the book haiti soars beyond the conscious is a kind of modernway inferno of wooden huts an occasional candle over a little group bowed over their rum like mourners over a coffin but the altitude once set is not maintained the comedians for all its promise of allegory inevitably bogs down in the shallows of politics sociology and bible morality the protagonist is a man named brown who is returning to his adopted country after failing to sell his resort hotel near portauprince on the boat back he meets jones a sort of international gay blade looking for adventure and the smiths a naive american couple who plan to establish of all things a haitian vegetarian mission vegetarianism isnt only a question of diet mr brown if we really eliminate acidity from the human body we would eliminate passion each is examined in his relation to haitis police state needless to say the americans are quickly disposed of at the first assault on their jeffersonian sensibilities they flee in despair to the dominican republic jones surprisingly acquires a sense of purpose and joins the resistance movement but brown although exposed for the first time to a clearcut moral issue cannot regain the faith he lost at a monte carlo seminary a political as well as a religious cynic he discovers too late that the world for all its senselessness is after all real the conclusion is of course true yet the truth of a major novelist one feels should run a bit deeper the comedians indeed in its unfulfilled promises reads like a blueprinted masterpiece that went astray and greene one of the best of the moderns typifies the general poverty of midth century literature at one point for example protagonist brown finds himself face to face with one concasseur a captain in duvalliers notorious secret police the tontons macoute this monster this mindless assassin of women and children betrays for a fleeting moment just the briefest glimmer of compassion and brown reflects i could understand whv these men wore dark glassesthey were human a true psychologist a dostoievsky say would have just begun his probebeyond freud beyond christ into the unresolved regions of the human personality but greene balks at the challenge concasseur emerges as a shallow onedimensional villain who simply hates revolutionaries for all the modesty of his concept however greene demonstrates once again his special qualifications like a true heavyweight he operates easily in the realm of myth with duvallier appropriately likened to baron samedi a voodoo demigod and a saturday night visitor to haitian graveyards a grotesque figure in a ballet stepping it lightly in his top hat and tails on the sheer plane of journalism moreover the book while not totally free of that irritating and really needless specialness western writers apply to negroes is a largely objective representation of haiti at least as this reviewer experienced it last summer it is also a tribute to the haitian people one of the most civilized in all latin america in their persistent resistance to a mad tryant hamilton bims a the two worlds of somerset maugham by wilson menard sherbourne press is one of the most rewarding reading surprises this reviewer has come across in some time the book jacket has a rather impressively haughty painting of mr maugham on the front the great author is literally looking down his hawklike nose with his hands and legs folded in an almost too precise manner sitting on what appears to be a rattan stool the whole image projects a kind of grand majestic quality calculated to make the reader wonder if he could not better spend his time reading something else the thematic impressions suggested by the painting are skillfully captured and developed by the author mr menard the impression given by maugham staring from the painting is that he is a prig and a snob the fact that mr maugham was something of a snob is beyond question but this snobbery is skillfully shown by mr menard to be based not on race or station but on whether or not he found the person interesting his contact with the natives of the pacific his understanding and appreciation of their mores and sex standards substantiates the fact that though he had little time for those who bored him he was most patiently understanding and appreciative of those whom he thought manifested honesty and character a theme suggested by the rattan stool is that maugham was comfortable in the south pacific atmosphere and further that he got some support from this nothing could be more true as some of his most famous and rewarding tales came from that part of the world where he understood what was going on and where he felt comfortable in the setting there was something sensual about the south pacific of that time and maugham was sensual in his appetites although it appeared he was in some manner above or beyond sex it is amply clear that he was the recipient of some sort of vicarious sensuality from mr menards repititions of conversations he had with maugham about the islands since the topic recurring with the most regularity is sex and the manner and means in which it was practiced and enjoyed by the people of the south seas the reader is often on the point of asking himself was mr maugham in fact a homosexual there is something in the painting to suggest this and indeed obituaries have suggested as well that he had a certain ambivalence in this respect the delicate manner in which the hands rest in the painting is one clue and there are other points which cause one to wonder but the reader soon realizes that this is a minor theme at best and becomes deeply involved in this extremely interesting book about an extremely interesting man mr menard deserves to take a deep bow for the job he did in making this book exceptionally readable aided though he was by his genuine interest and liking for his subject matter as well as the fact that he and mr maugham had a great deal in common but without his considerable talents as a writer traveler and researcher the book would never have come off as well as it has perhaps the best way to sum it up is to say that this is not a book done to capitalize on the morbid appetites which develop after the death of a famous person this is a book done by a man skilled in his craft dedicated to his subject and greatly endowed with both sensitivity and talentbrooks johnson the white kid on the floor next to me bore the brunt of the violence that was going on in our area near the lunch counter i was sorry as hell for him on one hand but guiltily glad it was him instead of me on the other the next day i was too ashamed to look him in the face and a sort of coolness grew between us based upon nothing but the fact that i somehow felt he had gotten a beating that should have been intended for me since that experience i have often wondered what white civil_rights workers feel and think as they take to the picket lines lunch counters and such sally belfrages freedom summer viking press comes about as close as i have been able to get in coming up with some meaningful answers freedom summer is more than just a revelation of some of the feelings and thoughts of a white civil_rights worker it is a sensitive interesting perceptive piece of work the author is a very gifted writer and observer she is both a young impressionable girl full of good intentions and deeds and at the same time she is a realist that nothing of note escapes the combination is very fruitful as it is displayed in her book freedom summer offers the reader a welcomed escape from the usual well intentioned but lacking works that have been cranked out on this subjectbrooks johnson political science political theory philosophy and even physics for that matter all deal with the same topics if one gets deep enough into the subjects ultimately there must be some a priori determination about the nature of the universe and mans relationship to and position in the universe in the case of philosophy and social sciences there must be a determination about the real nature of man himself from this determination comes a logical progression of assumptions and notions about men that culminates in what we now call liberal or conservative political views neil staebler and douglas ross have compiled a book how to argue with a conservative grossman publishers inc to give you ammunition to defend liberal and demolish conservative arguments there is a certain pitfall in the book itself because it does such a good job of demonstrating how to argue with a conservative it might be assumed that the arguments presented in the book are the answer to conservatism but the hard truth of the matter is that the book does an excellent job of getting at the symptoms of conservatism but the causes are really couched in the conservatives basic concept of man for the liberals the logical progression starts with the notion that man is basically good and has altruistic ethical judicious forces within him and it is circumstances usually that make him anything other than a good person for the conservative man is basically bad and it takes discipline learning determination and courage to change himself into something desirable this is perhaps a gross oversimplification of the points of views but essentially it is pertinently correct mr ross and mr staebler have done an excellent job of selecting out some of the more troublesome points of the conservative and providing us with adequate answers but the real problem in changing a conservative is not to thwart his arguments but to change his thinking about men basically i suppose that if a person were exposed to the devastating dialogue of this book he might want to make certain reappraisals about things but im not certain that he would be that moved to make the basic alterations in his conception of men to make him liberal but in all fairness to the book it does what it sets out to do what is now needed is not a criticism of this book but the production of a book that is convincing enough to alter the basic thinking about the true nature of man there can be no real permanent improvement unless man is seen in more positive light by men but the fact that this problem has been articulated and argued in the works of the early thinkers and philosophers right down to today convincingly attests to the resiliency of the problem and the elusiveness of acceptable permanent answers perhaps there are none but the mere glimmer of hope that there may be one is reason enough to goad men on further and further in the search for answersbrooks johnson when t s eliot wrote some of the essays in to criticize the critic farrar straus giroux he was a controversial avantgrade poet now with the collection and publication of these essays after his death he is a venerable member of the establishment with rebellion flaring among the beatniks the black mountain school and the new york school what helped him get into the establishment besides his composing very good poetry was his authoritative criticism which helped to explain his kind of verse his critical essays not only afforded understanding of the poets whom he discussed but gave insights into the writing of poetry he was able to embody these insights in memorable phrases like dissociation of sensibility and objective correlative which served as touchstones to a particular style some of the same insights into literature and language occur in this book and i cannot do better than to quote a few of them which incidentally answer some of his younger criticson a separate american language advocated by william carlos williams but i was puzzled by the subtitle it is called a dictionary of the american language perhaps i am unconsciously bilingual so that whichever language i hear or read seems to me my own but certainly the vast majority of the words in this dictionary are words belonging to both america and england and having the same meaning in both and the definitions seemed to me to be written in english too the following quotation could apply to the beatniks to insist on the allimportance of subjectmatter to insist that the poet should be spontaneous and irreflective that he should depend upon inspiration and neglect technique would be a lapse from what is in any case a highly civilized attitude to a barbarous one eliots reflections on vers libre published in are just as valid today with todays attacks on the iambic pentameter he says but the most interesting verse which has yet been written in our language has been done either by taking a very simple form like the iambic pentameter and constantly withdrawing from it or taking no form at all and constantly approximating to a very simple one freedom is only freedom when it appears against the background of an artificial limitation the division between conservative verse and vers libre does not exist for there is only good verse bad verse and chaosdudley randall i as a new kid in town had to go through my share of fights and squabbles to prove that i was not to be messed with but there was another kid who never seemed to be able to prove that he was not to be messed with i accidentally found out one day that his father owned the jewstore and somehow in my eight year old brain i connected his fathers occupation with the burden the kid had to bear one day i was about to fight with a kid bigger and older because he deliberately threw my ball down a long hill i didnt relish the encounter because i wasnt sure of the outcome but he had done it without any cause and had to take him on or lose face in front of the others just as i was about to get it on a voice rang out ill get it and down the hill ran this jew kid he came back up triumphantly with the ball he was winded but said to the bully the next time you do that im gonna kick your ass i wasnt too sure i wanted someone fighting my battles for me but i was somehow certain that this kid wasnt just taking up for me a strange affinity grew up between us and we became close friends we both became known as capable guys with our fists but when it got around that we had formed a sort of mutual protection pact we were left to do pretty much as we pleased i knew that because my friend was jew and i a negro we shared something in common that separated us from the white kids yet it gave us a special understanding and appreciation of each other rabbi abraham l feinbergs storm the gates of jericho marzani munsell provides the reader with a special insight into jewry but more than that it does so in an interesting and moving literary style the special result of reading the book is the fact that people of open minds and goodwill are enabled to better understand and appreciate rabbi feinberg in particular and something of jewry in generalgreat books bring something new to the world in one form or another good books usually bring refreshing style restatement of established ideas clarification about existing things or better insights rabbi feinbergs book is a good book he brings new clarity and understanding in what might be termed an autobiography but the understanding takes manv different forms much of it is scathing criticism of the hypocrisy foolishness and supercilious things to which the world spends precious time and effort paying homage but despite the fact that feinberg states that jews are just people we must also keep in mind another fact moses jesus marx freud and einstein all were jews if a people who represent just one half of one percent of the worlds population can produce men of this caliber then the rest of us have some lessons to learn from them and thats the real value of the book it provides us with lessons that would benefit us all to learn and applybrooks johnson in the interactions between the white man and the black man there is one fact that emerges with clarity and impactthe black man knows his white counterpart infinitely better than the white man knows his colored brother white men it appears go to africa for myriad kinds of reasons but despite this variety of motive we see something of a uniformity in the kind of reactions and thinking they express about africa this is because they are relatively consistent in their lack of understanding of the black man and thus anything they might later think or articulate is shaped and warped by this ignorance sean grahams a surfeit of sun doubleday is another example of the post african independence novel we see coming from intelligent gifted writers who have spent time in africa and are now chronicling africas problems after independence there is a formula that is discernible in these books we have interracial involvement between the major characters combining with race prejudice from both sides mixed liberally with the inefficiency of the local african government to produce circumstances that cause the natives to revert to savagery it is certainly true that these elements do exist and can and do combine to create rather undesirable situations but a rather constant flow of this kind of story certainly distorts the picture and the last thing that africa needs is more distortion but further and even more distasteful is the fact that the books leave the reader with the feeling that the reasons for the chaos is because black men are now in the drivers seat the truth of the matter is that we have problems in africa because we have unskilled untrained sometimes greedy men in power who happen to be black white airconditioned ibm thinking is applied in a tropical setting where the greatest need is perhaps antibiotics and education and this thinking comes up with the conclusion that what is necessary is more colonialism surfeit is defined as meaning excess superfluity overabundant supply with mr grahams book i think a surfeit has been reached in this kind of bookbrooks johnson at the eastwest v p allstar game seven of the ten starters were hoards neg ro a former nba player once an allstar himself walked out of the arena shortly after the game began i was disgusted he said later there were just too many of them i couldnt get interested in watching them play on november st louis started three negroes against philadelphia which started four by the second period all ten players on the court were negro nobody wants to say anything but of course the owners are worried how are you going to draw with colored players on your teaman nba coach oscar robertson sat on his bed in a new york hotel room one day several weeks ago sure he was saying to someone you cant overlook the situation dont know if what wilt said was true but people cant say its not true it could be true the owners and the players know it could be true what wilt had said in a wabc radio interview with howard cosell was that the growth of the nba had been held back by the preponderance of negro stars in the nba wilt said it calmly and with the reservation i think a theory a theory which if correct suggests something about the sports fans of this nation was wilt correct did the men who run the nba agree and if so were they reacting with regard for high principles or their pocketbooks i put the questions to nba general managers coaches and players their answers varied i will get to them in a moment but there was agreement on this in an astonishingly short time negro players have come to dominate the league in there were only six negroes among the leagues players of these only one maurice stokes was an allstar early this season of playing jobs in the national basketball association were held by negroes of these were normally starters and of that were allstars in other words almost half the nba players were negro twothirds of the starters were negro and nearly three of every four allstars were negro and there are more coming the next wave of superstars is percent negro cazzie russell of michigan is todays top college senior mel daniels of new mexico is the top junior westley unseld of louisville is the top sophomore lew alcindor of ucla is the top freshman how to explain this flood of negro talent they have a natural talent for basketball one exnba player told me basketball is a rhythm game and negroes have that natural rhythm the rhythm theory got whoops from negro players heck said one for every negro with natural moves there are ten who can hardly run without tripping but you get to see only the one guy with natural ability we make it by work work work said oscar robertson another negro star told me we know we can t settle for being as good as a white player like in everything else we got to be betterlots betteror were not going to get the job they say negroes naturally jump higher than whites the negro jumps higher because he knows if he doesnt its back to the ghetto several nba people cited gus johnson as an example of the negro athletes tremendous drive to succeed jerry lucas has more natural ability than gus said one player but gus will outplay him more often than not gus grew up playing ball on the streets of akron ohio and all he heard about was that lucas kid at middletown and how great he was jerry went to ohio state and all of ohio raved about him gus had to go to idaho now when he plays against jerry gus eats him alive and jerry doesnt do much against gus you can see gus out there and i know hes thinking i had nothing in my life never had and this big white kid had everything ill show him ill show him most negroes grew up with a basketball court around the corner in the slums says walter kennedy commissioner of the nba there is no room for little league baseball or junior football but you can play basketball wherever you put up a hoop and it costs nothing a kid goes to a schoolyard checks out a basketball and he can play all day summer and winter another thing when i was a boy i wanted to be like babe ruth just as negro kids my age wanted to be joe louis in the last decade negro kids can imagine themselves being wilt or oscar with boxing on the decline negro kids have new idols to pattern themselves after and as a result you get more negro stars in baseball and basketball certainly the number of negroes is increasing in all sports but in basketball the players wear the briefest uniforms no face masks no head covering either and the fans are closest to the court willie mays races back for a fly ball and his glove darts up out of a blur of white or grey uniform jim brown assaults a line and a bright orange helmet spearheads a swiftmoving missile of dark shirt and white pants bill russell reaches for a rebound and black skin sparkles when boston starts k c jones sam jones bill russell tom sanders and willie naullsas red auerbach has doneone need not be a racist to note that all five are negro when the st louis hawks warm up one sees men clustered in the small area of halfcourt and needs no adding machine to count that seven are negro one sees the philadelphia ers come out for a tapoff and need have no eagle eye to ascertain that five of the six players on the bench are white chamberlain believes this preponderance of negro talent will hold back the leagues growth and he explained why to howard cosell people for some reason tend to pull for things somewhat similar or like themselves and so when they come out they want to root for something thats similar something they can see themselves in this is not always true of course there are little white boys who pick up a bat and say im willie mays but by and large as chamberlain said people root for something thats similar something they can see themselves in they do it he said for some reason the reason we suggest is race prejudice subtle prejudice unconscious prejudice very often but it is there and the fear of nba owners the question that worries them is in a society that is percent white is this prejudicethis ability of some white spectators to identify with negro athletesdeep enough and widespread enough to hold back nba growth to be specific will it keep attendance on a permanent plateau dim interest of tv sponsors prevent the spread of franchises to the south let us examine each question will it hold down attendance our figures simply do not back up wilts claim that our attendance is stagnating says haskell cohen nba publicity director attendance last year was percent up from the year before during the past five years our attendance on the average has increased by ten per cent each year this year says commissioner kennedy attendance in the first month was up more than per cent over the comparable period last season i would say definitely that attendance this season will exceed the per cent gain we made last season when a team wins says cohen it draws when it loses attendance falls off its as simple as that ill give you a good example says kennedy san francisco when we went in there pro basketball was unknown and attendance was awful but in the team won the western title and attendance went way up in the team finished with the worst wonlost record in nba history and attendance dropped almost to where it had started in that period the ratio of negro to white players on the team didnt change much this proves i would think that the boxoffice record of a team is tied directly to the wonlost record of a team a number of negro players agreed with kennedy look at the dodgers in baseball said st louis lenny wilkens sometimes they had five or six negroes on the field and they drew two million they drew because they won overall nba attendance has jumped per cent since equalling the growth rate of pro football and far outpacing baseballs minuscule five per cent it is true that nba attendance is less than half the attendance of the national football league though each nba team plays games and each nfl team only but a per cent annual growth rate even allowing for some exaggeration in the counting is hardly stagnation where wilt is on firmer ground is when he points a finger toward boston the celtics are the pride of the league winner of seven straight championships as winners in they averaged in attendance as winners four years later they averaged the boston arena holds chamberlain did not say this but his point is implicit when he discusses celtic attendance when whites like bob cousy and bill sharman starred with russell attendance was on the rise when the jones boys replaced the two white stars attendance crept up only slightly averaging out to less than per cent a year in an affluent city with a championship ballclub the best of all timethis might well be called stagnation why should a team with a record compiled such as it boston has wilt said to cosell not draw to capacity crowds whereas the hockey team fills the house almost every night are you saying to me said cosell that one of the reasons that hockey plays to per cent attendance capacity is because it is all white i definitely believe that said wilt hockey draws well in boston answers commissioner kennedy because boston is the seat of american hockey basketball pro or college was never big there until after the war anyway if what wilt says is true then the logical alternative would be that if hockey added negro players attendance would decline i doubt that it would fall off and again the commissioner cites the rise in overall nba attendance but the unanswerable question the question nba owners consider is would league attendance have gone up higher if there were more white stars will the negro dominance dim tv interest the american broadcasting company paid the american football league million to telecast football games in the fall of the same network paid the nba to telecast basketball games in in broadcasting circles it was said that the reason for the disparity in prices was the lack of a white nba star that question never came up in our negotiations with abc says kennedy and believe me a lot of questions came up the reason for the difference in prices says nba officials is that nba teams have local tv contracts which afl teams do not have these local telecasts make nba games less attractive to the networks thus the lower network bid abctv says it has been happily surprised by the ratings for nba games last season the ratings were averaging per cent of tunedin sets which was slightly higher than the ratings for afl football games however the afl games had to compete against nfl telecasts but there is no sign of any frenzied bidding as there is for pro football among the tv networks for nba games im only being realistic one broadcasting man told me when i say that if a white center were to come along to challenge chamberlain or russell the ratings for those games would jump at least fifty per cent will the negro dominance limit the spread of new franchises into the south of present franchises only baltimore and st louis could be considered southern cities st louis attendance is soso baltimores poor but neither have titlecontending teams the baltimore situation is interesting baltimore has a high negro population and the teams two stars for a long timegus johnson and walt bellamyare negro yet the percentage of negro attendance is far below the percentage of negroes in the city this has raised another disturbing question for the nba if an nba team were to be allnegro would it not only alienate some whites but also fail to drawfor economic or whatever reasonsthe citys negro fans not so said several negro players a team with a lot of negroes will draw white and negro fansif it wins said one baltimore doesnt draw negroes because it loses a negro fan is like a white fanhe wants his moneys worth of some odd applications for new nba franchises two have come from the deep southatlanta and new orleans one indication that such franchises could succeed came this winter st louis with seven negroes on the squad scheduled eight games in memphis tennessee in their first memphis game the hawks drew a hefty an nba club would go over in the south with per cent negro players said one white southern player but the team would have to be a winner the fact then is that negro players have come to dominate the nba and economic questions have arisen as a result the fact too is that important nba men have been thinking about these economic questions their thought has spurred some action and some criticism for starters this seems certain the negro fringe player has been badly hurt up to or so says a man close to the nba you kept a colored player as your ninth or tenth man you had to pay him only or so a lot less than you had to pay a white boy but not any more now the tenth and th players are white boys to balance off the squad today you replace white with white colored with colored as your white bench men slow down you draft whites to replace them when your colored starters slow down you draft negroes because it is a lot easier to get a fast strong negro forward than a white one if you have to go with a white forward against a negro forward youre in trouble the white boy isnt strong enough fast enough tough enough if youre eighth or ninth man and colored youre dead one negro player told me if an owner has to cut someone he cuts whats a worry for hima negro the racial balancing of teams began as a gentlemans agreement believes willie jones who played for detroit from to willie was a hustling guard and when detroit cut him a baltimore official talked about picking him up what for said someone else hes an eighth or ninth man and hes colored today willie at is in the insurance business in chicago he says he has no bitterness toward the nba he thinks he was cut because he didnt get along with coach charley wolf but he has no illusions either around he says i think the owners said lets keep the number of negroes down to say no more than three but then someone started to carry four and he was winning and he said the hell with the agreement so the others started to carry four then five to catch up and the thing kept buildmg several years ago when the bullets were run by a different management its draft pickers were reportedly told get a forward any forward as long as hes a white forward the bullets drafted gary bradds whod slowed down a step in his senior year at ohio state what really killed me said one man close to the baltimore team is that we could have gotten either willis reed or lucious jackson jackson and reed became league allstars bradds was cut this year commissioner kennedy likes to repeat what the late walter brown owner of the celtics told bill russell several years ago after russell had charged there was a racialquota system in the league said brown to russell i dont care if youre pink white or eskimo youve got a job on this team as long as you can play basketball but kennedy concedes that he has no way of knowing whether all owners share browns sentiments one nba coach tacitly admitted there was a racial quota when he told me you know we cant carry of them there is no quota system on my club says richie guerin coach of the hawks if there were do you think i would have retired mike farmer white and kept jim washington a negro who like farmer is st louis tenth or th man richie is one in a million says a negro on the hawks the rest of the nba is the same as baseball they figured a negro cant play as a regular so they let him go around the league they will tell you that the hawks loaded with negroes are desperate for a white star to replace pettit the hawks wanted billy cunningham who is white real bad in the draft last year says one nba coach the hawks died when philadelphia picked billy ahead of them we play to win answers hawk general manager marty blake thats all we care about another coach said he thought red auerbach was having second thoughts now that he is the general manager about the race situation i notice said the coach he plays ron bonham a lot now and he boosts mel counts both are white we put the best men out there auerbach roars only the best were not interested in politics or race problems im a basketball coach thats all the nba brass may not be interested in politics or race problems per se but since politics and race problems are interwoven here with that motivator in pro sports economicsthere is nba interest and says one negro explayer on the subject of negroes and nba economics suppose oscar and wilt and bill withdrew from the league the nba would be wrecked i think the negro has helped more than hurt the league true but now with one nba team official saying the talent in negro colleges is unbelievable they have guards who dunk and with another man saying that on a talent basis within a few years the league could be percent to percent negro the fear is that has hurt will soon if it has not already replace has helped times have changedfor the betterbut prejudice did not die with the civil_rights act of the nba knows it is facing a problem it cannot morally or legally discriminate one immediate solution to the problem suggested to me by nearly every nba player and coach to whom i talked was expansion i dont see any reason one negro star told me why pro basketball cant support as many clubs as pro baseball or pro football the thinking is that at least percent of these new jobs would be filled by negroes but others would be taken by whites who otherwise would be shut out of the nba the thinking too is that with expansion there could be four divisions giving better balance and more winners and winners usually do well at the box office another solution suggested by one nba team official is more vigorous promotion of the league just as it ispromotion to offset prejudice i hear them moan says one nba team official they say how can i draw with all those negroes i got on this club the trouble with them is they dont know how to promote the greatest game in the world they think all they have to do is throw open the doors expansion and more vigorous promoting these are two solutions the real solution of course must take place inside peoples minds david was happy he was waiting for victoria to ask her a if she answer question and gave him the he expected he would be happier still he had played in the schoolyard all afternoon and when he had enough of play he came up to his den in the attic his den was at the end of the attic near the one small window level with the floor his desk was an old army blanket spread on the floor his bookcase an egg crate containing his books and notebooks the window overlooked the playground which extended from his backyard to the school near the other end of the block he swung it open admitting the freshness of the april afternoon and the voices of the children on the schoolyard davids glance wandered over the field flooded with sunshine a group of boys and a group of girls were playing baseball and smaller children were climbing on the swing supports and the horizontal bars near the alley some older youths were playing dice with one on the lookout for the roaches the bright shirts and dresses the movements of the ball players the crack of bats on balls and the shouts of the players made the field a world of color and motion and sound david projected himself into the scene he was striking the ball running the bases he was crouched in the corner over the dice caressing them and talking to them like a lover while he was immersed in these actions he was aware of another self that stood aloof and watched him doing these things and of yet another self that watched him watching himself like a series of mirrors david did not see victoria on the playground and he began to write in his notebook in the spring of his seventeenth year david first saw her and fell in love with her she was playing with other girls but she was the only one he saw she outhit and outran and outlaughed them all she was tall and lithe and shapely her arms and legs were bare and darkened by the sun to the color of bronze her voice was like the sound of silver that was how he first saw victoria he learned her name from his friends and asked his big sister about her rachel laughed are you carrying a torch for victoria what do you see in her shes boxankled and walleyed she has big eyes and pretty legs david paid no attention to rachel she was laughing at him only because he was interested in a different girl from the ones she was always trying to put off on him and in whom he was never interested rachel told him that victoria was an orphan she lived with her uncle and her aunt who made her do all the housework but let her come and go as she pleased after she had done her work david learned all these things about her before he ever spoke to her one day as he was shambling along the street with his eyes cast down to avoid stumbling on the level pavement he saw a pair of small feet then a pair of brown legs he did not know whose they were but there was something familiar and exciting about them looking up he saw victoria coming toward him there was no one whom he would rather have met yet he began thinking of ways to avoid her he looked about wildly but he had passed the alley and had not reached the cross street he could turn into a doorway or cross to the other side of the street but that would be too obvious he could pass her without speaking but that was rude but if he spoke to her first would she answer him now she was upon him what could he do she smiled and said hello david david grew dizzy and faint and thought he was going to fall on the street he put out his hand as if to clutch at something and stammered hhello after she passed he leaned against a telephone pole until he was able to walk again after that he would speak to her whenever they met he made no attempt to seek her out or to go the places where she might be he was content with occasional chance meetings they made his days rich and adventuresome who could tell when and where he would see her he would speak to her she would smile at him and utter his name always the same thing happened to him the blood rushed to his face his knees grew weak he became dizzy and could hardly speak he would make his way back home giddy and excited and would write an account of the meeting about this time he became acquainted with dantes love poetry in the new life it expressed his emotions perfectly dantes chance meetings with beatrice and his adoration of her were just like his encounters with victoria and his love for her he read him incessantly and learned the new life almost by heart he bought an italian grammar and a book of italian poetry and read dantes love poems in the original things might have gone on like this indefinitely if he had not had a talk with ned adams david liked to go to the settlement house sometimes to work out with the boxers one night ned adams who was the city amateur middleweight champion asked him to go a couple of rounds with him david shook ned twice with rights to the head the champion could have hurt him in retaliation but goodnaturedly refrained he smothered david with left hooks and looping rights to the head but his blows had no more sharpness than the sheathed paws of a playful kitten when they were dressing ned looked him up and down and said youre built like a fighter you have a punch like a mule and are fast as hell why dont you train regular in two years we could make a champion out of you a lightweight on the next bench laughed hes too busy chasing tail david said hotly i cant be bothered with girls they get in my hair ned looked at him skeptically he was older than david about twenty maybe you dont have the right line girls like to be courted you cant stand off and expect them to come to you you have to go to them i know that girls cant talk sense like you can talk to another guy you have to give them a lot of bull tell em theyre pretty and crap like that theyll eat it up and theres another thing you have to play each one different im fooling around with a little fox thats trying to play hard to get ive been giving her the absent line i havent been around for two or three weeks when i do show up shell be ready to fall into my lap victoria is not like that david thought nevertheless neds words made him think of getting better acquainted with her so far he had been content to admire her from a distance this feeling had come on him so suddenly that he had not had time to adjust to it he was not sure what he would do but he vaguely imagined that some time in the future victoria would be his girl now he began to think of some practical means of winning her he made up his mind that the next time he met her instead of merely saying hello he would stop and talk with her and learn to know her better the very next day when he walked into mr siegels drugstore he saw her standing by the counter he was totally unprepared for the meeting at least when he met her on the street he had some seconds of preparation before speaking to her now he was totally surprised he could hardly stand so he dropped upon a stool at the soda fountain victoria smiled at him thinking of things to say he forgot to say anything mr siegel said whatll it be david mechanically he blurted out ill take a soda then suddenly to victoria wont you have one with me no thanks i just had one his heart sank she hesitated but i wouldnt mind another one she sat down by his side they began to talk of school and of neighborhood events david had often dreamed of some day talking to wise men and poets but even in his imagination those conversations were not so exciting as this one with victoria she was easy to talk with and gradually david became outwardly calm but all the while the air seemed shaking with some tremendous music of organ or full orchestra to which his heart blood and pulse danced riotously he never knew what they said but he noticed how long black and curly her hair was and how it poured upon her shoulders her eyebrows were straight and thick the lashes long and glossy her eyes were large and soft her nose delicately chiselled her skin was coppercolored and her cheek suffused with red had the gentle curves of a childs after she finished her soda she stood up and said thank you for the soda i enjoyed it as she walked out he noticed the way her waist tapered from her shoulders and breasts he sat with his head on his hands thinking about her at last mr siegel said david does anything hurt you david started up without a word and walked out for the next two days david lived in the memory of those moments then he began to miss victoria he watched for her from the window looked for her in the streets and even walked past her house but he did not see her one day rachel found him sitting moodily in front of the window and said david why are you sitting by the window looking half dead holy pete if you like victoria why dont you go out and get her instead of mooning in front of the window and reading those silly books but what can i do shes never invited me to her house i wouldnt invite you to my house either if i were victoria in the first place why dont you get rid of that sloppy sweatshirt and those baggy pants and change to a shirt and tie and then get some savoirfaire is that what those overdressed dimwits that come to see you are supposed to have at least theyre more polished than you my shabby bookworm but listen to me im trying to help you if you want victoria to be your girl youll have to go out and get her faint heart never won fair lady why dont you invite her to go out with you but where could i take her there are lots of places movies picnics dances i know just the thing my clubs giving a dance next month you can invite her to that for a start ill give you an invitation but how can i take her to a dance you know i cant dance ill teach you you have weeks to learn come on lets get busy right away rachel put a record on the phonograph and began to show david the basic steps after he learned them she had him dance with her dont stand so far away i wont bite you im your sister now relax let yourself go and dont be so wooden and for heavens sake dont look so mad youre not in a gym at the end of his first lesson david had made definite progress he danced every day with rachel and practiced by himself often he was stiff and selfconscious but sometimes he forgot himself in the music and rachel would look at him in surprise and say youre doing fine victoria will enjoy dancing with you her praise would make him conscious again of what he was doing he would look at his feet and think of the steps and then rachel would scold him for making mistakes at the end of a week of daily sessions he thought he had learned enough to invite victoria to go with him to the dance today he was going to invite her he was waiting until she appeared on the playground then he would go outside and speak to her he looked out the window again behind the roofs were pink and orange clouds the level sunlight stretched long shadows across the field reflected from the red bricks of the street the light took on a rosy hue victory was not on the field david reached for his book of italian poetry and began to read one of dantes love sonnets how wonderfully dante described beatrice and the way he felt about her how wonderful that the description fitted his own girl and himself so perfectly the poem seemed to be not dante talking about beatrice but himself speaking of victoria he would translate it he would put it into english so she could read it and at the dance maybe he would show it to her he turned to a blank page in his notebook and began to write my lady carries love within her eyes how true that was about victoria her eyes were soft and warm and contained nothing but kindness the first line of a sonnet was always the easiest now for the second which renders noble all she looks upon how true that line was also for whenever he saw victoria he felt cleaner and finer just as dante had written the divine comedy for beatrice one day he would write a great poem for victoria the second line of a sonnet was generally easy too but the third line was where the rimes and the difficulty began when she goes by men turn and gaze at her that was exactly what happened whenever victoria walked down the street for david was not the only one she attracted when she passed slim and graceful with her long black hair hanging over her shoulders he had seen men turn around and draw in their breath but that line would not fit it did not rime with either of the preceding lines the thought of her walking down the street reminded david that this was about the time she came to the playground he glanced out the window she was there she wore a plain white dress like a nurses which fitted snugly at the waist she was playing catch with another girl two boys stood nearby watching now and then they said something to her and they all laughed she missed the ball and one of the boys turned to retrieve it for her but she raced him to the ball and picked it up herself he grabbed her around the waist but she twisted smoothly away from him that was one of the things david liked about her she did not allow anyone to take liberties with her even when boys tried to do her favors because she was a girl she refused to accept them but kept herself in a position of equality with them her refusal was not the curt i can do anything you can do and better too of some athletic girls but a gracious declining that still left them pleased with themselves and with her she was popular with all the boys and with girls also everything david noticed about her made him like her and since he stumbled on every curb and every flight of stairs was ashamed to look into mirrors and could never think of anything to say he admired her all the more because she was graceful and beautiful and friendly now he would go out and speak to her now he would ask her to go to the dance with him and she would consent he stood up to go but after taking a step he paused suppose she refused what could he say to persuade her until now he had not imagined anything but that she would consent now the thought of failure made cold sweat come on his brow he had better wait a few minutes and think it over perhaps he could think of some winning graceful way to ask her he picked up the book and lay down again to think how clean and fresh she looked in the museum was the torso of a greek girl which he loved the cold white marble seemed to breathe and be soft and warm to the touch victoria reminded him of this torso but with a subtle difference she had not the antique greek lines her shoulders were wider her breasts larger her abdomen flatter and deeper and she could not be expressed in cold white marble she was like a statue of bronze of warm polished bronze with a glaze that gleamed silver in the light above the warm brown metal beneath there was such a glaze on her skin he imagined it to be sleek to his fingers his attention was diverted to the schoolyard by a sudden movement two figures split from the knot of gamblers and walked toward the far end of the yard david recognized them as ned adams and willie george lee ned wore a closefitting white rayon polo shirt blue jeans and moccasins he was stocky and barrelchested but moved easily and lightly willie george was also a boxer a flyweight and a tapdancer as well he danced in the smaller night clubs he was older than ned and one of his cronies he was dapper as a flea in a lavender sport shirt green slacks and brown suede shoes ned and willie george swaggered across the playground boys greeted them and girls turned and looked into their faces but the fighters did not notice them they stopped a few feet from victoria she held the ball in her hand and looked around ned stared straight at her she looked into his eyes she dropped the ball ned picked it up and handed it to her she smiled they began to talk meanwhile willie george accosted the other girl she was a short plump girl named eva whose brother was feebleminded david knew her for one night she came to him and a friend on the schoolyard and asked them to lie down in the doorway of the school with her the boys stared at each other hot flustered my father told me to come home they said in unison and walked away now willie george seized her by the waist and led her through a dance step they laughed and applauded themselves it was growing darker the color of the air deepened from rose to violet one by one or in little groups the boys and girls went home their cries and laughter faded away in the dusk the two couples were alone in the shadows the street lamps came on there was one in the alley near the schoolhouse it cast a silver light over the field but the entrance of the building recessed was deep in shadow ned was still talking to victoria he leaned close to her took her by the hand pulled her toward him she did not resist or draw away as she did with the other boys davids face burned he could imagine vividly her quick smile her large slowmoving eyes her ringing laughter the sweet smell of soap on her body the electric atmosphere about her the impression of delicacy yet strength that her shape conveyed he could also imagine her sensing neds confident grin his powerful chest his deep vibrant voice his pungent sweat they stood close together their bodies touching davids whole body was on fire he would go down there he would join them he would make believe he was passing by and would stop and talk with them but something kept him rooted there like a spectator at a play who identifies himself with the actors and is involved in the action but who can in no way influence it part of himself was victoria and part of himself ned with another self watching himself the actor and a third self watching himself the observer eva squealed willis george was unbuttoning her blouse she shook her head and pulled away he grabbed her arm and dragged her toward the doorway she leaned back resisting and shrieking but her shrieks dissolved in giggles and she let herself be dragged along they disappeared in the shadows now victoria and ned turned they too strolled toward the doorway neds arm was around her waist victorias arm was over neds shoulder david could imagine under victorias fingers the sleekness of the rayon shirt the hardness of neds swelling muscles he could feel under neds fingers the narrowness of her waist the ridges of her ribs and as his hand moved upward the softness of her breast they were on the steps of the building ned pulled victoria closer to him she did not resist they moved together into the shadows david was trembling he hated ned he hated victoria he would fight ned he would punch him to ribbons victoria victoria why have you done this to me why have you betrayed me you are no good you are cheap easy no why blame victoria you are a fool how did you know she liked you what made you think she was yours how can you compete against ned what do you have to offer the book of poetry which he had been clutching slipped from his hand he picked up the book through the window came a peal of laughter from victoria he flung the book down on the blanket with a sob it was black dark now too dark to read drcrawford has a fifty dollar name for my ailment being incapable of using small numbers or symbols other than dollar signs he labels my trouble hysteria realizing psychiatrists thrive upon mysticism and words i insisted a broken water pump caused the entire mess but this mercenary medical guardian employed by my wife prohibits my leaving this place before coming to grips with reality upon explaining my recent misbehavior to the doctor i may merit a furlough so each day by talking into the tape recordercost fifty dollars a weeki hope to convince the doctors of my ability this taped therapy they term orally catalyzed mental catharsis but i recall confession at old st marys was less expensive that is another part of my problem which began quite simply the water pump burst without warning it was embarrassing driving through our quiet suburb with the car rattling like tin cans so i caught the bus the ride brought a return of pleasant childhood memories bus number traversed the old neighborhood where very little had changed music shrieked from a few more taverns and smoke belched from numerous barbque houses but basically objects appeared familiar the trip was invigorating realizing new perspective might be gained i decided to ride the number all week the fiftyfirst street elevated line was a bustling transfer point in this highly segregated city the station became an oasis of integration cosmopolitan life converged at the doors focused on bulging buses and l trains then dispersed in a cacophony of organized confusion one figure remained unchanged amid this turmoil each morning a man holding a magazine high repeated everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die this sage comment attracted my attention and that of other bustling transferees risking a glance i noticed the cover displayed a tall slender bearded man wearing flowing robes the thick halo surrounding his head found its light quickly absorbed by a brown face even workers soured by the necessity of rising before dawn smiled sweetly at the inference that our lord was a negro brown and white faces transmitted smiles across racial barriers mutely judging this representation ludicrous they proceeded toward train connections that night my wife lucy little league star billy and five year old daughter sharon laughed as we discussed the funny man with the magazines lucy suggested i purchase a copy to show neighbors believing race relations to be strained sufficiently we decided the suggestion was inopportune in retrospect i recall no one ever bought a copy of the bearded mans magazine next day the fellow was present at the station which was obviously his regular post that second night during dessert the family joked about the black jesus man then little sharon dropped the bomb daddy she gulped pulverizing a strawberry suppose jesus were a negro children can say the funniest things and i smiled all the way to the office after that remark the third day conditions were the same but now i studied the faces of the passersby since the same people used this transfer point by midweek they had grown accustomed to the salesman i detected few smiles and wondered if other sharons had introduced doubt in other minds on succeeding mornings i evaluated the faces noting the expressions varied between mirth resentment and confusion by friday the resentful group owned my allegiance sharon didnt help showing us copies of dusky semites and displaying dark faces from her religious story books my daughter seemed to enjoy our mounting discomfort to avoid censure she amended her queries by purring might christ be partly negro with the arrival of sunday the joke had gotten less humorous i decided to buy the silly magazine planning to refute each argument the salesman wasnt there that night a voice reiterating everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die precipitated nightmares fortunately the car was available then followed my mistake in visiting young omalley at the parish rectory the reverend father sensing distress encouraged me to speak my excessively tense voice startled even me as i blurted could christ have been black after a few moments hesitation the priest answered truculently why not surprised by the brevity of his reply i snorted fiercely thats a hell of an answer and steamed toward the door calming me with an apology father explained god the father of all could conceivably send his son as a blend of all men since each of us needed redemption i got out of there fast on the way through the church it happened glimpsing the communion rail the thought struck next time i go to communion ill be swallowing the body and blood of a nigger hurrying to the public library i checked out several books on social customs during biblical times but i couldnt summon the courage to read them havent been to church since lucy made me promise to visit the psychiatrist the night i almost slapped little sharon for asking to go for a ride on the number bus this damn recorder is almost out of tape one last thing must a man be called insane who buys six hundred new water pumps randma looked at the clock and shook r her head in disbelief she had about an hour left before grandpa came down he was always on time you could set your watch by him hed be down this morning at seven she smiled that mans like a rock strong and always there she stacked all the ash trays on the drain board their dark stained bottoms gave off a heavy odor that suddenly made her ill she thought she still saw the white clouds of smoke hanging over the table but they were gone she opened the window picking up a newspaper she fanned in the sooted morning air she remembered the time there wasnt much left the table cloth had been white enough for a tv ad but that was over twelve hours ago now it was spotted with coffee cigarette ashes liquor and handshands that had been rubbing across its fibers hands wiped on it and hands cold with perspiration nervously fingering and palming it as they waited the turn of chance the table cloth came off then the blanketpadding ill have to use a lot of bleach to get this one clean she mused she didnt like to use too much bleach not good for the cloth tears it to pieces she wiped the oak table clean she liked her oak table it was old and warm its grain was wide open stained a little but warm and well used she never believed in using a table cloth she liked the wood too much she found herself thinking about too much this morning guess im getting old cant seem to think about what i should be about whats the use of covering up this wood just being here means youre going to get a little soiled whats a few stains i like to look at some things and know that theyve been used and loved guess thats all because ive been here so long she set a place for paul his large cup was to the left of his plate his fork knife and teaspoon were to the left also after the first six months of their marriage shed learned to set the table right for him margie her friend had washed the dishes god there was plenty of them shed had a big crowd there last night more than shed had for a long time twentyfive pounds of ribs forty pounds of chittlins a mess of coldslaw and bread had all disappeared there was no telling about the coffee think i had about five pounds theyd eaten more than shed thought yet something against all her reason had told her to buy a lot this time cant go wrong when you listen to yourself she sat down for a while her legs were tired an aching tiredness that seemed to be creeping up into her thighs lucky the kitchens a good size id never be able to handle a crowd like this if it was one of them small ones she was up again she put the shoeshine box beside his chair at the table she stood tall almost stretching but too tired to try it she noticed her feet sliding across the floor she didnt have the strength to lift them but to mattie it seemed as if her large heavy frame belonged to someone else feeling somewhat distant and uninvolved in this worn out tired fat hulk she moved about doing what she had to do the hot water was on eggs bacon grits and toast the toast had to be done lightly grandpa didnt like his toast burnt and didnt like it done in one of those machines either she put three slices of bread in a tin pan and slid it into the broiler maybe i got high blood pressure maybe i ought to go on a diet i shore do tire easily now but you just cant stop a game because youre tired you got to let them play had to stop them early in the first place aint never goin to have him come down on a game know how he feels and thats that his wants come first thats that her breast hung lower than usual this morning they were at her waist line she looked down at herself it was an impersonal and curious examination remember the time when you were something to look at look at you now my god lucky you got a man you sure couldnt get one now not even a old one fact is you couldnt get a dead one the grits were boiling shed wait a few minutes before putting the biscuits in the oven she wanted them to be hot for him thats how he liked them shed done real well this weekend she hadnt counted her take but she knew that shed done better than anybody else in the neighborhood her players were more than gamblers they were her friends they came and kept coming she smiled if youre goin to do somethin you might as well do it right im proud of my games theyre the best round thats fact theres no gettin around it either she couldnt understand jims boy hed been there last night mattie had always liked him in fact she still did what happened last night hadnt changed that but she just couldnt understand him trying to pull one over on her he shouldve known better theyd run through all her new decks all she had was five new decks on hand five had always been more than enough but not last night no last night some had a run of good luck but some had a run of bad luck too good luck and bad luck always seemed to run together its just a question of what side of the coins facing up or going to fall when luck is running bad some of the players would try anything cleaning their glasses sitting tight and motionless as their hearts almost burst through their chests with the fall of each card drinking coffee by the pot others whiskey without ever showing it calling for new decks as though all the other decks theyd touched during the night were cursed or worse alive with hatred for them shed watched her players over the years she knew them and they knew her she didnt argue with them about their ways not even when some of them got loud and cursed a bit too much she just didnt want them to wake paul up and they didnt they seemed to remember that he was upstairs and quiet down sometimes shed have to give one of them a look thats all it would take her players were one big family they were her children her brothers and sisters yet mattie often wondered about her saturdavrelatives the quiet knowing that each had about the other bluff was impossible each knew the other too well more than their money and time they brought their innermost selves to the round oak table and a bit of each was placed with each bet and a bit lost with each pot the winnings never seemed to balance things out they were always looking for those bits and scraps that got away the last time mattie had seen it all happen even to herself theyd all grown old around the oak table each came and humbly offered himself to the game hoping for a sign an omen a bit of luck after all the psychology and odds had been stretched to the end fate spoke the final word so they played each saturday using their skills of a lifetime knowing how little they counted without lucks blessings mattie as well as the rest knew something else they loved the game and loved to challenge and prick the lady perhaps to force her smile her blessing how could jims boy know anything about their saturdays their game had everything to do with living nothing to do with winning but winning was important too just how would you explain all this to a young boy you just dont because you cant mattie sent jims boy to buy five new decks he was younger than the rest of the players but he was jims boy they played several hands then jim noticed the white borders on the back of the cards some of the borders were thicker in places jim snatched the cards from the table and thew them against the wall his hands were quick and one lashed noisily across his sons cheek the boy left jim was mad his anger hung heavy over the table stilling and stiffening the players sarah bless her she started talking fast soon everybody was listening sarahs words had buried the boys cheating it was just nonsensetalk at first then she got quiet and started up again it was about her marti her daughter i know people are talking about her it aint true either shes just developed fast thats all shes goin to marry ralph hes her age aint nothin to all the talk about ed why hes twice her age and a lot more aint nothin to it there was just the betting and faces naked and still staring at the table i dont know what to do this things ripping my insides out god the heads raised and the faces looked at sarah she breathed hard i pass big bill spoke up next it aint easy livin ill take two cards it aint easy tryin to make it but we just keep tryin sarah lifes like a bad joke you hear for the first time sometimes the more you think about it the funnier it gets well the more you think about livin the funnier it gets but it just dont get funny until you get some of it behind you then you can laugh then it seems like youve always been a child doin and thinkin childish things then its funny real funny and the jokes been on you but too much thinking had gone by paul was coming down mattie waited paul grunted his mornin there was a twinkle in his eyes mattie smiled at her old man he was short just a bit shorter than mattie his thin wrinkled brown frame was straight he moved slowly and unsteadily but with a tall pride he brushed his shoes and at the same time he looked her kitchen over mattie tried to walk without limping or dragging her feet the pain was still there and still hurt when she moved but it didnt hurt anymore when she walked it just made it hard for her to walk paul watched but said nothing he polished his old cracked shoes mattie had tried for years to get him to polish his shoes before he got dressed he never would so shed always put the shoeshine box next to his chair at the table she still didnt like it he always managed to get a little shoe polish on his white cuffs or socks but shed learned to live with his ways his brush strokes warmed the shoes to a bright shine he looked for his rag a few beads of water and the rag then the black leather would raise a shine like glass in the sun he looked at his right heel the rubber on the outside was almost down to the leather mattie sat opposite her husband his hands were a bit shaky as he pushed his butter into the biscuit slowly he went about his eating it was a serious business with him she watched satisfied with his silent chewing and expressionless enjoyment theyd had a good life together each had managed to stand tall and free of the other but theyd been together in their living she felt sad she remembered telling him some years ago how much she loved him and how good he was all this took place many years back during the time when she believed that everything had to be said he answered mattie youre the good one and once more the strong one i just got sense enough to know that i find my joy in what i know i mean what i know down deep about the both of us occasionally he looked at her his eyes smiled he wanted to speak to say something but he thought better of it mattie was breathing hard it looked as though her shoulders were pulling up her stomach in order to get air into her her eyes were red the long curly hair under her chin seemed longer sometime ago shed used the long black and gray hairs framing her forehead to cover the bald spot at the back of her head now the long black and grays in the front were fewer and no attempt was made to cover the back she just brushed it accepting in amazement what the years had done to her her jaws hung loose her neck and chin were one run of flesh disappearing into her chest paul stood and brushed off a few crumbs from his clothes with the back of his hand he rubbed most of the crumbs off his lips and chin mattie you dont look well ought to go back to bed you mustve had a fitfall night last night go on back to bed and rest some more plan to paul i plan to go back paul left slowly he walked down the street his head was low his blurred gaze followed the irregular cracks and ridges in the sidewalks he too felt tired hed wanted to say something to her but there was no way now too much too long had changed any talking about some things after all he hadnt been fair with her hed helped her in this game of theirs and couldnt go back on her now it meant too much to her mattie rested on the couch in the living room just a little sleep and ill be back strong again she thought of her man everybody loved paul he was a good man top deacon in the church he was a real christian everybody said so she even said so hed always been the same a good man shed respected him for that shed never do anything to harm or hurt him people just accepted her for what she was she loved her cards and couldnt take much of churches her paul wasnt like all the other christians he lived his religion she went to sleep paul walked up the bridge over the railroad tracks and yard it was a harder and longer walk this morning but his pace was steady and shoulders high nothing seemed quite right this morning yet everything seemed right but in a different way although tired and weary inside his spirits felt light and free although his legs were heavy and troublesome to lift they felt young and vibrant he couldnt reconcile all these different feelings god he muttered you know i aint never professed to be nothin but what i am you know

church for over the last thirty years he was the first one there on sunday morning at seven fortyfive each sunday morning he opened the doors the nightcooled air moved into the church with him the sun warmed the large doorway and brightened the center aisle usually paul dusted the pews and pulpit although he dusted yesterday evening he liked to go over everything just one more time with everybody coming in on sunday morning looking so nice he didnt want anyone to get dirty by coming to church today he felt a little too tired he sat on the deacons bench it was his bench theyd made him a deacon forty years ago hed been a deacon a long time he never did anything never said anything about how the church was run hed just been a deacon sometimes a praying or singing one he closed his eyes and took a nap hed feel a bit stronger after a while he was weary right now he still could see the sunlight making a warm path down the center aisle he couldnt really see it but his closed eye lids were bright and warm mattie tried to rest shed slept for less than an hour it was a worrisome time for her she couldnt help thinking about her paul yet she was the one ailing she started to get up but didnt sometimes bein strong is lettin other people be she wondered what paul had meant it didnt make too much sense to her her games were taking too much out of her she thought about giving them up but what would her saturdays be like she didnt need the money anymore there was nobody but her and paul the kids were gone but she had her games it was her saturday nights she looked forward to them

down expecting to see her tiredflat bosom smouldering soon bursting into flame the tall one spoke first mattie it just happened so peacefully like we thought he was asleep we didnt know he was dying until the morning service just when the preacher took his text he fell off the bench he tried to say something about a game i dont think i understand exactly i think it was something about a game she came to once she stared from behind the plastic oxygen tent and smiled discrimination has struck at the heart of the american j yti l dreampromise of freedom and equality of opportunity tnc for over years it has gnawed at the political and vs g social fabric of america at times threatening to over c whelm us it has exacted high costsin human suffering economic loss a loss that approached billion in inferior education blighted neighborhoods and infant mortality to mention only a few racial discrimination has been a serious handicap to our foreign policy especially in our relations with the peoples of the developing nations of asia africa and latin america as the republican candidate for the united states senate i advocate a broadlybased massive assault against all remaining forms of discrimination in american life i call for an open societya society which extends to all americans the freedom and opportunity to have equal justice under law to obtain quality education to enjoy decent housing and good health and to gain equal access to the economic benefits available in a free enterprise system in order to achieve an open society the thinking and approach to the problem of civil_rights must be redirected there must be a major shift in emphasis in current programs i suggest three guidelines a coordinated comprehensive strategic attack the problems of racial discrimination are interrelated they occur in discernible patterns patterns of segregation in housing are reflected in de facto segregation in schools substandard education is correlated with high rates of unemployment limitations on employment and the opportunity for vocational advancement in turn restrict income and economic mobility discrimination is a system that will yield only to a coordinated comprehensive strategic attack in recent years other than civil_rights groups the federal government has borne the brunt of this attack but state and local governments and the private sector of our nation our universities churches our labor unions businesses and civic associationsmust be allies an excellent example has been massachusetts which has actually moved in a direction that is well in advance of the federal government if this nation is to deal with more than the individual symptoms a constructive partnership will be needed between the public and the private sectors at all levels metropolitan planning the problem of discrimination against the negro is no longer a regional problem the experiences of depression war and population migration have made it a problem of national scope increasingly focused in our metropolitan centers of population negroes who have moved to the nations cities have been excluded by economic and racial barriers from the predominantly white residential suburbs the growing ghettos of our central cities with their deteriorating housing inferior schools and generally inadequate public facilities now stand as the greatest challenge to the achievement of an open society if the nation is to resolve the problems stemming from racial concentration in our cities it will need metropolitanwide planning it cannot be bound by local prejudice or by the inertia of poorly conceived governmental programs too many federal programs stop with the central city when the basic problems of discrimination are much wider here must be a willingness to experiment with enlarged governmental districts intergovernmental compacts new site locations for housing schools and other public facilities and programs that link two or more communities in the metropolitan area in substance a new metropolitan perspective must be applied to virtually all facets of discrimination in our urban society without such planning the problems of the ghetto will become insurmountable vigorous enforcement of the law another guideline for any effective civil_rights program is vigorous enforcement of the law the national administrations failure to enforce civil_rights laws has caused great disappointment title vi of the civil rights act of bans discrimination in all federally assisted programs but not until may of did the secretary of health education and welfare announce that federal funds would be withheld from school districts that practice discrimination one year after passage of the civil rights act the united states commission on civil rights found that there were discernible patterns of noncompliance in nearly twothirds of the hospitals surveyeddespite the fact that each hospital had received financial assistance from the federal government weak enforcement can be traced in other areas to inadequate planning and staffing moreover some enforcement procedures have proved to be ineffective tools in rooting out discrimination the complaint system for example has generally proved useless because the burden of filing court suits has been placed on the victims of discrimination existing civil_rights law must be a more potent weapon in the war against segregation and discrimination legislation must be vigorously enforced enforcement agencies must be provided with adequate staffs to provide the necessary leadership and those laws which contain inadequate enforcement procedures must be amended these principles should guide our attack in the following major areas of discrimination in american society i education twelve years after the supreme court decision on school segregation virtually no progress has been made in desegregating our schools only about six per cent of southern negro children attend school with white children in both the north and south negro schools are almost always inferior in quality to white schools and both negro and white school children now receive an inferior education to the extent that they are not being prepared to live in a pluralistic society the elimination of segregation from the schools is the most critical issue facing american education today the united states office of education sets the guidelines under which school systems must desegregate the most recent guidelines of march are considerably stronger than those issued in the past however despite the may deadline for filing compliance agreements for the school year by mid july school systems in the south had failed to submit plans for desegregation as a first step for meeting government demands close to more school districts had submitted agreements but attached conditions that may prove unacceptable upon review in the face of this open defiance of the civil rights act of no federal funds were withdrawn from school districts that discriminate until may of this year and only districts were affected at the time whereas segregation in the south has traditionally been supported by law northern style segregation commonly referred to as de facto segregation has risen primarily from community custom and indifference segregated patterns of housing and gerrymandered school districts in philadelphia percent of the pupils enrolled in public schools are negro in manhattan percent of the children are nonwhite in washington d c percent of the pupils in public schools are negro and the percentages are increasing the tragedy of the ghetto however involves more than the racial concentration of our schools as psychologist dr kenneth clark states segregation and inferior education reinforce each other the quality of education invariably suffers the federal government has taken no action in the north in the mistaken belief that the mere threat of withholding funds would force school districts to take steps toward ending de facto segregation but even this threat has been removed with the recent announcement by secretary of health education and welfare john gardner that title vi of the civil rights act of did not apply to de facto segregation recommendations to meet the crisis in education faced in the north and south alike i strongly urge that the following steps be taken action on school desegregation prompt and vigorous enforcement of title vi of the civil rights act of banning discrimination in all federally assisted programs is required the federal government must not hesitate to cut off funds from school districts which fail to meet the governments standard to assure this end congress should provide adequate staff and funding for the enforcement operation of the office of education and should increase its initial appropriation of to desegregating school districts congress should enact title iii of the administrations civil rights bill of which would strengthen the office of the attorney general in desegregation suits ttiis section would allow the attorney general to file desegregation suits even if he did not have a written complaint and local residents were financially able to sue on their own behalf reducing racial concentration shortterm measures such as the pairing of schools busing for example the metropolitan council for educational opportunitiesbetter known as metcoin massachusetts and open enrollment while quite useful should not be regarded as permanent solutions to the problem of racial imbalance an adequate solution will require metropolitan area planning congress should move to clarify the ambiguities contained in title vi of the civil rights act of by enacting legislation which makes de facto segregation of schools illegal and provides for the withholding of funds from school districts which practice de facto segregation the federal courts should be given the authority to enforce the provisions of the law at present massachusetts is faced with an anomalous situation in which state funds have been withheld because of de facto segregation in the boston school system while millions of dollars are poured into the city by the federal government federal grants issued under title i of the elementary and secondary school act should be used as incentives to metropolitan planning federal funds issued for school construction should be used to break up rather than strengthen the patterns of segregation the states in cooperation with the federal government localities and private sector should implement effective metropolitan planning in education such planning should include the enlargement of school districts new transportation patterns and the construction of new schools aimed at reducing racial concentration educational parks in particular represent a promising bold approach to the problem of achieving quality education and more racially balanced schools these school complexes would assemble on a single large campus children from an attendance area broad enough to include both majority and minority children the concentration of students teachers and resources would result in richer programs and more services than any individual school could provide their strategic location would help alleviate the problem of racial imbalance as well teachers and curriculum teachers can play a vital role in upgrading the quality of education and in school integration where practice teaching is done on a segregated basis the federal government should take action under tital vi of the civil rights act of state departments of education and local boards of education should actively recruit and train qualified teachers who are negro congress should provide adequate funding for the national teacher corps an imaginative effort aimed at breaking down the vicious cycle of poverty and ignorance in rural and urban slums a comprehensive system of preschool centers for underprivileged children operating both during the school year and during the summer months is required the hightly successful operation headstart program should be expanded systemized and imaginatively administered finally new methods of curriculum should be devised textbooks should reflect a more realistic view of the role of minority groups in our history for millions of negroes housing means the lack of free choice in selecting a place to live and congested ghettos that breed broken homes delinquency illegitimacy drug addiction and crime since world war ii the pattern in housing has been new homes in the surburbs for white families with rising incomes and old homes in central cities for negroes indeed the trend in recent years has been accelerating because i believe the situation in housing has reached crisis proportions i strongly urge that the following steps be taken banning housing discrimination the administrations housing bill banning racial discrimination in the sale rental or financing of all types of housing represents a potentially important advance in assuring freedom of choice in the open market this legislation is a significant step toward achieving the promise and spirit of the constitution and the declaration of independence nevertheless the administrations method of attacking discrimination in housing ignores a more potent instrument the president could deal with the problem of discrimination in housing more effectively by issuing an appropriate executive order president kennedys executive order no banning discrimination in fha and vafinanced housing covered per cent of the total housing supply by extending the executive order to all housing financed through banks and savings and loan institutions whose deposits are guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic more than per cent of the housing supply could be covered in the absence of an executive order the administrations bill should be supported however it should be strengthened in its proposed methods of enforcement the concept of a federal fair housing board with effective enforcement powersadopted as an amendment in the house judiciary committeehas sound precedent in numerous state open housing laws states and local governments should also take the initiative in ensuring open housing massachusetts has strong fair housing laws they have been widely accepted by the citizens of the commonwealth eighteen states now have similar housing laws on the books these laws should be strengthened and vigorously enforced the massachusetts republican platform of calling for increased funds and authority for the massachusetts commission against discrimination should be implemented housing low and moderate income families our present federal and state housing programs have been hampered by inadequate funds poor planning and the power of suburban areas to veto housing plans thus confining subsidized housing to the core city ghetto a coordinated effort between our public and private sectors is urgently needed to increase the rate of housing production for low and moderate income families the present rate of housing production is only million units per year most of this housing is priced beyond the reach of families below the median income level housing production must be increased to at least million units per yearat least half of which should be made available to low and moderateincome families both federal and state governments and private sources as well should contribute toward filling this gap congress should provide funds for the department of housing and urban development hud to conduct research in such areas as the amount of substandard housing and the need for lowincome housing in the nation so that federal programs may be directed to the areas of greatest need the rent supplement program recently approved by congress should be made metropolitan wide in scope by elimination of the amendment allowing local government to veto rent supplement projects as originally introduced the rent supplement bill was designed to encourage the development of housing throughout the metropolitan region and to rent a portion of these new units to low income families under a supplement program the local veto amendment minimizes the possibility of locating units outside of congested city cores metropolitan planning any attempt to reduce racial concentration in housing must necessarily involve the dispersal of lowincome families through metropolitan planning the various governmental units must undertake joint ventures to meet the problems of both desegregation and increasing the supply of low and moderate income housing on a metropolitan areawide basis districts within the metropolitan area should be rezoned and provisions made for low and moderate income housing programs these programs should be comprehensive enough to provide for community services and transportation networks to other areas federal and state housing funds going to local governments should be used as incentives for the development of metropolitanwide plans for low and moderate income housing revitalization of the ghetto on a longterm basis the plight of the ghetto can and will be relieved by an open market in housing and meaningful planning of low and moderate income housing outside of the central city in the meantime we must utilize our present resources to rehabilitate the ghetto it is not enough to tear down and renovate our slums equally important is the need to link the physical rehabilitation of the slum to the social rehabilitation of its inhabitants the administrations demonstration cities bill represents a new approach to the problem which deserves to be tested however the program is deficient in its failure to embrace the entire urban community the program should provide incentives for planning on a broader scale for those areas in which the problem of segregation transcends the boundaries of the central city community action programs provide people living within the ghetto the opportunity to improve their situation through cooperative effort they also serve to call the publics attention to the substandard living conditions of the invisible poor to be effective these programs will require imaginative approaches by governmental agencies at the local state and national levels iv employment l millions of negroes remain untouched by the wealth of our affluent society the unemployment rate among negroes is seven per cent more than twice the average for whites often negroes can only find employment in lowskilled lowwage occupations and industries with the lowest growth rates and the most limited opportunities for advancement moreover these jobs are most vulnerable to the rapid pace of automation joblessness among negro youth is a particularly acute problem as of april per cent of outofschool negro youths between and were unemployed twice the rate for white youths in the same category these unemployment figures are reflected in the mounting welfare budgets of our major cities recommendations no single simple quick measure can eliminate these critical problems i strongly urge the adoption of a broadly based action program which includes the following points new enforcement powers for the equal employment opportunity commission title vii of the civil rights act of which prohibits discrimination by employers unions and employment agencies should be strengthened at present the equal employment opportunity commission created by the act to carry out title vii can only investigate complaints of discrimination and then seek conciliation if no redress is possible the individual must take the initiative in seeking redress in the courts because of the complaint system the eeoc has had only negligible impact on employment discrimination in addition the eeoc has been hampered by insufficient investigative powers and resources limited enforcement powers which are complicated and ineffective and a lack of administrative authority to undertake or coordinate manpower development or economic opportunity programs in support of its enforcement activities title vii of the civil rights act of should be amended to authorize the equal employment opportunity commission to issue cease and desist orders against individuals engaged in unlawful employment practices and to order back pay to those who have suffered financial loss through the denial of equal employment opportunity state fair employment practices commissions a number of states have made important advances in establishing state antidiscrimination commissions however the effectiveness of these state agencies has often been limited by inadequate financial support and excessive restraint in enforcement states should take the initiative in strengthening state fair employment practices commissions eliminating discrimination in trade unions in spite of the progress made by labor unions to promote equal employment practices a number of unions continue to discriminate against negroes unions have a special obligation to make a place for those against whom they and employers have too long discriminated i urge therefore that government contracting authority in accordance with the civil rights act of and an executive order banning discrimination on work done by federal contract be used to insure equal employment practices and expanded training opportunities on all federal projects it is regrettable that the department of labor and justice did not initiate action against trade unions to enforce nondiscrimination on government contracts until february unions on all levels evaluate and revise all programs and practices that discriminate unfairly in job placement job training or advancement national union leadership should take affirmative action against unions that continue discriminatory practices unions increase job opportunities in the skilled crafts and building trades by a actively recruiting negroes and others into craft unions b establishing preapprenticeship training to help negro youths qualify for apprenticeship programs metropolitan job councils metropolitan job councils should be established by private sources in all major urban areas to plan coordinate and implement local programs to increase job opportunities for negroes membership should include representatives of business organized labor education and other appropriate community organizations these councils would accumulate uptodate information on the negro labor force and job opportunities in the area and would help coordinate and improve existing programs technical assistance would be offered by the councils to help employers and unions make positive efforts to recruit negro workers and eliminate unnecessarily rigid hiring specifications rural employment programs many marginal farmers have become victims of mechanization shrinking acreage allotments and racial prejudice the migration of unskilled rural negroes to urban areas has created additional problems between and the number of negro farmers decreased by per cent to meet these problems i recommend that the secretary of agriculture move immediately to implement the recommendations of the united states civil rights commission aimed at the elimination of segregation in department of agriculture programs the secretary has made little progress in implementing the report which is now over a year old the department of agriculture extend to negro farmers the necessary assistance information and encouragement to give them the equal opportunity to diversify their farm enterprises federal state and local agencies and private groups as well cooperate in the development of comprehensive programs to facilitate the adjustment of rural families moving to urban areas centers should be created in rural surplus labor areas to help potential migrants make arrangements for jobs and housing and should provide vocational and personal counselling employment programs for negro youth programs for intensive counselling of negro youth the sector of our population with the highest incidence of unemployment are grossly inadequate the need exists for yearround youth job placement services counselling services for inschool youths should be improved and expanded with the aid of skilled vocational advisers acquainted with requirements of industry expanded high school vocational education programs are also needed in urban and rural areas to train youths effectively for occupations in which employment opportunities are available business and industry should work closely with schools and labor unions through metropolitan job councils where possible to gear inschool training realistically to job requirements and to broaden inservice training opportunities negroes are subject to more illnesses and disabilities than white people they lose between one and onethird times as many days of work from disease or disability and have a higher infant mortality rate and a seven years shorter life expectancy the figures are integrally related to poor living conditions and inadequate health care the effects of inadequate health care are compounded by discriminationespecially in the south despite the fact that title vi of the civil rights act of bans discrimination from health facilities receiving federal funds widespread discrimination against negroes still exists negro doctors dentists and technicians are all too often refused staff privileges and excluded from professional societies negro nurses are excluded from training programs paid lower wages and forced to eat in segregated cafeterias and negro patients continue to be placed in segregated wards the persistence of this discrimination can be traced in large part to the failure of the u s department of health education and welfare to take steps necessary to achieve compliance with the law effective enforcement action has not been taken except in cases where complaints have been filed field inspections have not even been made to ascertain the extent of noncompliance to remedy these abuses in medical care i strongly urge that the following steps be taken enforcing compliance in health care hew should conduct surveys and thorough field examinations to determine the extent of discrimination in federally assisted health programs funds should be withheld from those hospitals which continue to discriminate against negroes in violation of the civil rights act of finally hew should take steps to ensure that hospitals participating in the medicare program comply with federal laws against discrimination improved health services while the new programs of medicare and medical aid for the indigent represent increased provision of medical services to low income families many of whom are negro they should be supplemented by additional experimentation in the concept of neighborhood health centers which provide a range of health services on a coordinated basis to all members of the family in a single location the neighborhood health center sponsored by tufts university in the columbia point housing development is an excellent example of how health services can be more effectively delivered to low income families that would not otherwise receive them comprehensive study and evaluation of ways of improving the quality and availability of medical services to low income families in both urban and rural areas medical research organizations both private and public should undertake thorough studies to examine the causes of the negros high infant mortality rate and lower life expectancy and should develop a comprehensive plan of attack on these problems the continued disparity between the negro and white population in these vital statistics is cause for deep national concern protecting negroes and civil_rights workers the tragic shooting of james meredith in mississippi was one in a series of violent acts committed against civil_rights workers since an estimated thirty negro and white civil_rights workers have been murdered in the south while countless others have been the victims of beatings bombings maimings and shootings the continuing failure of allwhite juries to convict assailants has in addition focused the nations attention on the gross inequities in the jury system in the south we can no longer tolerate a system of justice in which negroes and civil_rights workers are not free to exercise their constitutional rights we can no longer postpone fulfillment of our national pledge to liberty and justice for all it is time to guarantee that justice will be done throughout the nation a number of bills pending before congress and sponsored by republicans and democrats alike are designed to remedy these flagrant abuses i urge that congress enact a strong civil_rights bill during this session one that includes in this area the following provision for a representative crosssection of the population on jury lists thereby eliminating discrimination on the grounds of race or color in jury selection removal of certain criminal cases to the federal courts where state jury selection procedures are not in accordance with federal procedures greater federal protection against intimidation of negroes and civil_rights workers including stronger federal criminal penalties for those who deprive individuals of their federally protected rights amendment of the united states code so that local county and city governments are held jointly liable with officials employed by the government who deprive persons of rights protected by the code establishment of an indemnification board within the federal government with authority to grant money damages to the persons whose federally protected rights have been violated voting rights the voting rights act of largely removed the legal barriers to voting however apathy fear and ignorance continue to impede negro registration and voting while congressional action in the area of voting is not now needed the administration must take the lead in enforcement it has not yet enforced the law in large areas of the south notably georgia beyond enforcement the administration must provide more imaginative and innovative voter registration education where it has sent federal examiners pamphlets and posters in all federal facilities advertising voter registration might be used finally voter registration hours should be better advertised in southern communities home rule for the district of columbia since the people of washington d c have been under the jurisdiction of the congresstheir pleas for selfgovernment largely ignored the situation is made more intolerable by the fact that per cent of the population is negro while ten members of the powerful house district committee are from the south that this situation should exist in a nation which prides itself on its democratic principles is deplorable enough but that such a situation be permitted to continue in our nations capitol is reprehensible attempts to get a home rule bill through congress this year have once again failed but this issue must not be allowed to die i strongly urge congress to act and to restore democracy to our nations capitol once more f fcmg r the challenge of a great society cannot be fulfilled until we have achieved an open society with equal opportunity for all americans to obtain quality education enjoy the minimum comforts of decent housing sustain a potentially healthful existence and gain access to the material benefits of our abundant free economy this challenge is a particularly fitting one for the republican party as the party of lincoln to undertake it is a challenge underlined by the noble purpose and inspiration of a uniquely american dream for over the course of more than three centuries we have dared to seek r strength for our society by giving freedom to its members we have liberated common men and women and have discovered uncommon faith and power we have dedicated ourselves to the importance of the individual and have achieved unparalleled greatness as a nation as a people we must now fulfill the promise of that dream we must build a truly open society where all men have the right to achieve their individuality where every man has the right to participate in the american dream art of blending militant action with practical politicking as one of martin luther king jrs lieutenants in the campaign to end slums in chicago he is a cool and articulate spokesman for the aggrieved negro community and as director at jesse jackson is a seasoned veteran of the civil_rights struggle of the sixties but with a difference he has mastered the fine of operation breadbasket the jobgetting arm of the coordinating council of community organizations cccosouthern christian leadership council sclc coalition he spearheads a drive which brought chicago negroes jobs worth some in the first six months of the programs existence an associate pastor at fellowship baptist church in chicago the rev mr jackson is a student at the university of chicago divinity school he is a native of greenville s c and a graduate of a t college in greensboro n c where he was president of the student body and also served the community as field secretary for core he moved his family to chicago so that he could study at the seminary and he plans to remain in the ministry the heavy demands of the freedom movement notwithstanding at a time when many activists his age are rejecting the notion of nonviolence the rev mr jackson remains its advocate his confidence is as indomitable as his six power as dej till scribed by its initiator i k stokely carmichael g chairman of the stukscji i tvt dent nonviolent coordinating committee sncc is both a slogan and a political and psychological technique as a slogan it has the value that others do but as a technique for achieving change and rallying together the most powerless groups in american societythe negro poorit has enormous potential the national reaction to both the slogan and technique has been directed for the most part by advocates of a counter position in the white and negro communities those who are spokesmen for white fright contending for the national title as leading spokesman for the white fright advocates is eugene patterson editor of the atlanta constitution believing as do most white frighters that negro militancy equals riots rape and in a favorite phrase of white fright supporters irreparable harm to the negro movement the constitution under patterson has devoted almost more editorial space in recent weeks to denouncing black power than he has to supporting his papers hawkish position on the vietnam war it is too easy to characterize the opponents of black power as weakkneed moderates or even as clever divide and conquer manipulators who aim at destroying the surface unity that exists among the various negro civil_rights groups the white fright position is basically that american whites have admittedly been brutal and oppressive with years of white power therefore black power will mean that negroes will be brutal and oppressive if they ever get the upper hand this masochistic wishful thinking both deplored and welcomed as proof of the incompetency of negro militants springs from a desire to eliminate the militantand therefore uncontrollable sectors of the negro movement it amounts to little more than a refinement of the mccarthy eras redbaiting techniques and might well be called blackbaiting but the best analysis of the white fright conditionand its reaction to black powerhas come strangely enough from a white metropolitan daily newspaper the boston herald whose lead editorial reexamining black power on july reads black power has claimed its first two victims they are vice president hubert humphrey and roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp both men honored veterans of the civil_rights movement succumbed temporarily at least to the most ancient of maladies the inability to adjust to a new idea the editorial described humphreys criticism of black power as racism and apartheid and gave wilkins description of black power as black death it went on to say we find nothing subversive in sncc chairman stokely carmichaels remarks on the contrary says the herald this type of thinking is both practical and traditionally american nor should the older generation of civil_rights leaders object to the young negroes wanting to run their own show with white men supporting rather than dominating the various organizations this should be interpreted as a sign of maturity it means that negroes having won their legal rights under the old system are now ready to work toward their goals under their own leadership like any other minority this too is traditional american history does not show that the irish were content to be led by yankees or that working men were content to be led by their employees in short we are suggesting that the older generation of civil_rights leaders avoid the mistakes of hubert humphrey and roy wilkins and resist the urge to panic at the sound of black power judiciallegislative front the writer defined the new challenge facing negro leaders as the building of pride selfrespect and selfesteem and confidence of negroes as a group such advice was not taken then and probably wont be taken now but the challenge is still present and the recent disruptions in the civil_rights movement over the term black power clearly indicate that the need is more urgent than ever and that nethe editorial ends with a warning to both white and negro advocates of white fright we suggest that the older civil_rights generation reexamine this new concept of direct action and concentrate on the more thoughtful speeches of black_power advocates these young men are surprisingly realistic and are fully aware of both their capabilities and their limitations and like it or not they are destined to be the doers of the new era of civil_rights whether they do good or evil depends in part on whether their predecessors encourage or repress them apparently the a civil rights move ment has now reached s a p int wherein the old ways of doing things can no longer disguise the fact that our present tactics cannot budge the immovable stumbling block white americas rigid determination to keep black americans in their placewhich most of our leaders have long pretended would give way in only a matter of time the only alternative to the civil rights movement itself it seems to me would be stagnation or riots and more riots i think that what we really need is a complete reevaluation of the aims and methods of most of our civil_rights organizations also i believe it is long past time when we should stop pointing to the token gains made by the few amongst us and turn our full attention to the plight of the deprived and relentlessly oppressed many i think too that we must stop deluding ourselves with the belief that there are many white people of good will who are eagerly standing by to help in our allout fight for complete equality that there are some white people of good will cannot be denied but it should be obvious to all black folk by now that such white folk are few and far between if we are ever to find any solution to our increasingly intolerable situation we must go to the people themselves to our unfortunate brothers and sisters left behind in the shanties and the shacks and the teeming ghettos and listen to their ideas for only those who face the enemy qua enemy on a daily basis can really know the magnitude of the battle that lies ahead and only they can really know how they want to conduct their fight and i believe this is precisely what sncc has been doing and why directly or otherwise it has come up with the term black power i believe this is snccs way of trying to inculcate in black people the idea that if we are to survive we must somehow gain a sense of solidarity and rid ourselves of the old feelings of helplessness and inferiority that have always paralyzed us in america that sncc has really hit upon something can be readily ascertained by the instant and overwhelming hostility shown by the national press and a majority of those in the white community to ward this one twoword slogan to be sure it is more than just a slogan it is symbolic of a possible way of life a way of life that terrifies the white american even before it is realized for if we finally wake up to the fact that we too have power we will no longer willingly play the lackey for the white man who will then not only lose some of his selfcontinned from page esteem when he loses his ancient doormats but this same white man lives in constant fear that we will some day enslave our former masters that this idea is utterly irrational is beside the point after all if man were wholly rational he would never have been a bigot in the first place would he the current crisis facing f rtt y the civil_rights movement has the quality of death written in characters of blood fire and selfdestruction it is a killer stalking human preyand finding tj only americans without hearts religion intellect or democracy the american dream is failing so to speak and americans are proving to be just plain white people living a democratic lie in a nondemocratic society americans are proving by their actions that they are psychologically incapable of developing a native and original multiracial culture america has become a land of guiltridden illiterate and fearful proletarians white men and black men have failed to discover each other white mothers fear for their daughters black mothers fear for fear of their husbands amalgamation is not a concept but a condemnation to a nation tall and tense such is the stupid dread of a christian society a nation of christians spitting on priests and nuns and negroes here is the sad evidence of another rome in ashes but nero is a realtor heard in the choir on sunday mornings nero is a white homeowner or businessman standing against the windy sunlight looking for cleopatra in the ghetto nero is the black man afraid to give up his belly needs for his dignity this land of lincoln and du bois cries for interracial hot blood as a monument to its stupidity in spite of all the prophets in spite of all the warnings and sincere whites and blacks we shall not overcome unless a blackwhite jesus arises or willie mays picks up a gun instead of a bat the alternative is blood or blessedness everything or nothing it is black brown and yellow men against the western sleepwalker and at the same time it is the population asking the rest of the human race to preserve humanity black men must take by any means they can the blindfold from justice there are some wars in which a careful disorderliness is simply good tactics and whoever said that the socalled black revolution is anything else but a war against ignorance any man can die or be destroyed for his country but only a negro an american negro there is no other can save it if black power causes fear then black men obviously cause something profoundly deeper in the minds of many white americans richard wright wrote of black_power as a tool to be used by black men everywhere for the sole purpose of freeing themselves black power is black powder unjamming those solid mountains of white power and hatred black power may mean black people making decisions and building strong pyramids along the vile banks of hate in america white america is not aware of such dragon and suggestive language from the negro community black toms have not used such humorless and truthpiercing phrases before the outcries stem from to my mind the fact that white people have for so long put their words into the mouths of negroes that they cant imagine the coming of strong new voices unrelated to marian anderson or ralph bunche my opinion is that the civil_rights movement is not at the crossroads per se the very nature of the movement itself dictates that crisis become an integral and accepted part of its existence what the civil_rights movement is after is a chance for black americans to share in the power and the privileges which have previously been allocated to the whites and a negro elite it is a struggle to get the powerful and the privileged to relinquish their inequitable grip and let people in america share in the wealth and potential of america as americans and not as negroes jews orientals puerto ricans and wasps as kenneth clark states in the negro american no group of human beings can easily and graciously give up power and privilege such change can only come through conflict and anguish and the everpresent threat of retrogression being an underdog minority movement civil_rights is constantly subjected to emergencies and pressures and crisis is never any further away than the next confrontation with whites the next split in leadership or the fight against racism itself becoming racist having witnessed the civil rights movement survive both neardefeats and defeats i can only state that the fervor and determination for a successful resolution to the blight of racial inequality is so deeply rooted as to allay any fears that may exist about there being some ongoing form of active and dedicated civil_rights activity we have now lived with more than a decade of civil rights agitation for many this has become one of the basic elements of existence they cannot even remember when this was not an issue vital and pressing in their lives they are not going to be turned back but if the questions posed above refer to the fact that it would appear the movement is at the crossroads regarding what form of strategy will be utilized then i believe we have a more fruitful question for debate typically civil_rights thrusts have been basically nonviolent in nature the largest groups within the movement up until recently have steadfastly maintained a peaceful posture with the advent of the slogan black power and the vagueness and frustration that it represents there is a new crisis in the civil_rights movement as i mentioned earlier crisis is the common denominator of the civil_rights movement the question is of course is this new crisis of significant impact to actually represent enough of a threat to make significant numbers of people see it as an actual choice or alternative to nonviolence as the basic strategy characteristic the original question essentially asks what is the alternative to the nonviolent tactic in the struggle for equal rights the only practical alternative i can see to nonviolent tactics on the part of negroes is a wholesale and genuine acceptance and implementation of equal rights on the part of whites just as i do not see white america relinquishing its preferred position voluntarily so i dont see any long term practicality in black violence too many negroes are becoming involved in pragmatic answers to a basically moral and ethical question this makes us subject to the same kinds of expediencies and rationalizations that greatly account for the position we find ourselves in vizavis the whites negroes trying to explain and distinguish kinds of violence remind me of whites trying to justify separate but equal my response to question number two is that black power is subject to the same vagueness and great latitude of interpretation as is any slogan attempting to simplify a massively complex thing such as the emotion and feeling of people we americans have a deeprooted fear of the word power our whole national trend is based on the fear of power being concentrated when we link this basic fear and distrust of power with the basic fear distrust and ignorance of black humans we have something that both fascinates and frightens whites the press is alert and very swift to pounce upon anything of this nature in its business of making headlines the public reaction if we can identify one was similar to that of people discovering that unidentified flying objects do in fact in some form exist it is frightening because for so long we were told they were objects of the imagination suddenly we are faced with the realization that some strange force in a somewhat identifiable form which may or may not be harmful does in fact exist for me the essential question is this can the struggle against racism be justified if it in turn becomes racist itself the civil rights movement is being pressed to choose between the peaceful dignified and effective posture of nonviolence and the racisttinged call for defensive violence this defensive violence is not a case of fighting fire with fire but rather a case of lighting a forest fire with matches negroes are a minority in america we have the least money housing education and most important power we are not going to get power commensurate with numbers if we choose to fight the white man with the tools he used to subjugate us we are superior to the extent we press constantly for american ideals and their acrosstheboard fulfillment while the whites ignore them further to the extent we do this in a dignified and intelligent manner we will be more successful in our demands than they in theirs the black nihilists notwithstanding i think that the majority of black americans are interested in nam war and a desire for structural changes in the american economy black power this muchmaligned and misunderstood term simply means the marshaling of all power available to the black communities throughout americapolitical social economicto force the kind of changes necessary to end white oppression black power grows out of a clear realization that there are power forces among whites responsible for this oppression and that counter forces equal or superior in strength will have to be used against white society to end conditions causing racial discrimination so quick and hostile a reaction from whites stems from their misinterpretation traditional fears of negro closeness and more importantly the fear that the customary battle lines in the civil_rights movement will be changed to the advantage of negroes in other words whites could see fighting the battle if the most effective weapon negroes could muster was a feeble appeal to moral conscience arrayed against the massive weight of white economic and political control of negro neighborhoods now that segments of the movement have proposed fighting the battle on different grounds using weapons which propose not only to hurt the white mans conscience but his pocketbook and traditional political position as well whites are taking a second more frightful look perhaps a more fundamental reason for whites adverse reaction to black_power has been their inability to adjust psychologically to the sudden shift in the negro mood from one of patient plodding toward eventual freedom to defiant audacious demands for freedom now their failure to adjust to and accept the political economic and social rearrangements black_power demands made a rash emotional outcry from whites leading to misinterpretation almost inevitable theres no question that the movement is at the crossroads but to understand why j you have to go back to the late s before the term black power became popular during the latter half of the decade and into the early s a combination of historical developments dissolution of european empires in asia and africa the castro revolution in cuba the sitins and freedom rides in the south the burgeoning peace movement among othersproduced a class of impatient young rebels who were grossly intolerant of the gap between americas preachments and practices among these youthful radicals were stokely carmichael marion barry and john lewis all leaders of sncc at one time mario savio and bettina aptheker student leaders at berkeley clark kissinger tom hayden bob ross and other leaders of students for a democratic society essentially these radicals are telling america to practice what she preaches or suffer the consequences in the arena of world politics in the civil_rights movement the leaders of sncc and core heavily influenced by the developments referred to have split off from the more conservative naacp national urban league and sclc because the traditional methods of change have not closed the gap between theory and practice fast enough at the heart of the schism are these burning questions the answers to which will largely determine in which camp the masses of black people will enlist and thusly which road the movement will take from here on can the movement tolerate such a deep split at a time when quest for rights had been doing all their born days this parade saw leaders taking part in a pushshove match with beefbellied cracker cops at one point and spouting pussyfoot oratory over the privilege of pitching a tent at another meanwhile the great white fathers in washington were engaged in a marathon goosestep operation of successive steps to water down sections of this years civil_rights actand an act it is becoming which if the waterdown process continues must stop just short of liquidation pun intended everytime unrest boils up in the black community the white folks simply pass another rights act or bill to quiet them down for a spell but alas the meredith marchers emerged at the back of a pickup truck bed on the campus of a negro college where leaders were revealed to be infinitely more in accord on the matter of who would foot the bills than who would be permitted to caress the mike and serenade the crowd predictably they later wound up chastizing one another and chestizing themselves but in this they were of course doing what they do best entertaining and kowtowing to white folks and wobbly financiers mind you this is not to say that all of the fault of the foregoing rests on leaders alone they can be no better than their followers it is in large part the mental attitudes of their followers which reduce leaders to fundraising gimmicks geared to white pocketbooks and make it virtually necessary that they court coverage in the white press in order to emerge and remain as negro leaders we negroes will never get too far as a group so long as a negro must go through the white press in order to reach us so long as we depend on white sources for information and ideas about ourselves what in my opinion can be done about the situation it is hard to say in a brief discourse but to begin with the movement was crippled from the start by an ultra assimilationist craze for acceptance at all costs into a morally decadent white cesspool now cynically called the great society they have stupidly therefore placed love in a position of priority over respect from which love of necessity in the long run must flow frankly my hope is with the future generations this generation may bethough slightly less so than their parentsalready it is sad to say just a bit too far lost although this is not to give up on them entirely for this reason i like the budding movement for freedom schools i would add as adult counterparts tnt clubs t o w a r d negro togetherness which among other things would periodically hold soul talks and agitate at the grass roots level among negroes for business enterprise and educational achievement these may eventually manage to teach black children what i call an enlightened blackness a dynamic new sense of negritude the main drawback of the schools up to now has been the necessity for using women white mainly as teachers and moderators this is due in large part to the reluctance of negroes to donate their own leisure their fear of blackness and the fact that men are for the most part away at work or standing somewhere watching pretty girls go by or trying to make it to the next broad consequently the black child still suffers a shortage of male models and there is no one to teach black boys the arts of karate and boxing for example as muchneeded psychological mechanisms not so much for selfdefense as this is not no matter what you may have heard the age of flesh and bones alone in weaponry with a new burst of pride the black child also would gain the sense of aggressive persistence necessary for getting ahead in a successcrazed society this is essential provided they are not going to reject capitalism altogether and by rejection i do not mean merely failing to take as tenacious a part in the system as possible a course they have followed in the past why for example are four out of five jewish persons of college age in school two out of five orientals about one out of five white christiansand so few negroes by comparison to argue that it is merely because negroes experience a harsher degree of discrimination is to overlook the fact thatas the foregoing figures suggestmajor groups discriminated against except for negroes mexicans indians and puerto ricans exceed the college entrance standard set by the anglo saxon discriminators what we lack are pride and industry and nothing else will fully solve the black mans problems until he has those things the cohesion necessary for breaking down barriers will flow naturally from that else either the few barriers broken down by other means will seldom be utilized maximally by negroes as a whole so in a larger sense it is not the civil_rights movement socalled at the crossroads it is the misled leaders the uncle toms rev sambos and dr thomases who have come to the crossroads as indicated by their increasing necessity for revealing themselves as toms leading to a teaming up of the toms so to speak as over against the one or two true tigers among negro leaders rev kings dream is daily turning into a nightmare although i do not begrudge him his hallucinations of any sort but if rev king can dream so can i and other children of poverty unlike rev king and discrimination we have a dream of a new army of black men dedicated to freedom manhood and human dignity we have a dream of soon one morning demanding that the white man give us a chance in america and should it not be at once forthcoming we have a dream of preying instead of praying for our equal rights no we are not beyond flaying either nor swinging instead of singing and we foresee a black blitzkrieg already shown bubbling last summer in omaha chicago cleveland and elsewheremaking america a giant mushrooming watts in which this country will either solve its problems or get the destruction it deserves so many negro leaders and other crackpot lexicographers have been taking bushwhacks at the definition of black power that if i didnt know better than to believe a word they say id be completely confused by now whitney young for example opines that black_power is neither black nor whiteit is the green of the dollar bill the maroon of the textbook and the gray of the pay envelope although he is of course quite right on the surface i dont know about that green power talk my pay envelope is brown and whats insidethe paycheckis blue and often leaves me feeling if not looking the selfsame way frankly i feel fairly certain that negro leaderswith the exception of stokely carmichael and floyd mckissickdont know what any kind of power let alone black_power means james meredith for all the effort to educate him in the white folks schools and in africa still thought that a bible had more power than a bullet an uneducated white fellow had to teach him a bit of the power of perfunctory piety that is why they spend most of their time defensively explaining what black_power does not mean instead of what it means they plead that black_power is neither antiwhite nor antiblack i believe that black_power is at least problack that it means being black in all areas of the struggle for black manhood among racesby any and all means available to black men and their allies i suspect any informed person who pretends not to know what black pow er means of telling a baldfaced lie they know the meaning of power the ability to influence another even against his will if necessary and the meaning of black black power then means the ability to make others particularly white folks walk the white chalk line in a way that is of equal benefit to blacks black power would offset political and paycheck brutalitya cause and thereby automatically obliterate the current cry against police brutalityan effect white power means dollar bills billy clubs trick ballotry and bullets black power can someday be all of these too but unlike white power which except for greed and a bullyboy psychosis is wielded without a cause black_power is power in selfdefensebut no less deadly in effect it is a phrase which merely spoken is able to scare the hell out of white folks and that is good however i thought at first they were talking about sexual power about the only area in which we negro males are generally conceded the right to boast of superiority in terms of both equipment and performance and yet as of this writing those who use the slogan appear to believe that it means mainly bloc voting bloc power if you will instead of black_power indeed in another sense white powerwielders can depend on negro leaders to block power rather than blacken it negro leaders including most of those who spout the slogan would be the first to help quell any instance of the use of black_power outside whiteapproved channels hence one function the slogan has is a kind of capacity for separating the black sheep from the colored goats among negro leaders still should some leaders manage to make black_power materialize white liberals would tryand probably succeed intaking it over indeed one of the main reasons for white opposition to the phrase is its threat to white liberal power in the civil_rights movement note that more than preachers almost all white took out a full page ad in the new york times presenting a couple of thousand explanatory words and offering to provide the power structure more on demand to interpret the phrase the white presswhich unfortunately just about everybody gets his cueflew into a rage in a fearstricken effort to befuddle the concept even colored critics threw up the smokescreen of a black state and the difficulty of colored folk getting along together let alone running a state i do not think black_power advocates as a whole are calling for a separate state they appear to believe that as soon as we separate off the white folks will simply drop an atom bomb on us however negroes will eventually have separate cities anyway and now comprising twothirds of the district of columbia will soon have an allnegro state then we can move the white house to howard university and call it the black house even rev kingmay the lord have mercy on his soulprofesses to blame the black_power slogan for sapping the strength of the wobblylegged meredith march prophesies that black_power would be equally as evil as white power and has the holy gall to call on colored folk to think in terms of shared power white politicians quickly caught something of this demoniacal deception hubert humphrey stood with solemnfaced piety and told an audience of purplegummed negro leaders that black men are becoming racists while lbj limplipped a barefaced weaselworded line about being against white or black_power i believe that they see as clearly as i do black judgment day around the corner they can wait and see what it means not only the civil v r g rights movement but i vu the entire united at the crossroads negroes will no longer live on the periphery of the country they are expected to live and die for whites must decide whether it is better to share the country with all of its citizens or to face continual disruption of business as usual resulting in deterioration of all phases of american life for our negro leaders who are fast losing their following there could be no better rallying cry than black power instead of hysterically denouncing this cry the civil_rights organizations should grasp the opportunity to harness the energy of those who have lost hope and are floundering in violence and to channel this unused and undeveloped power into constructive and practical effort toward economic power political power educational power the power to protect ourselves from physical and emotional harm the inner power that comes with selfesteem the power to develop to full stature as human beings the white press is as usual attempting to create the situation it ostensibly seeks to preventan explosion that would obviate the necessity for sharing the power and sell a few newspapers as a side benefit or failing that to suppress the movement by instilling in the white public the fear of reprisal for its crimes and in our responsible leaders fear of censure from liberal whites the only white power that will diminish with black_power is the power of whites over blacks all other white power will increase proportionately since in this country white power plus black_power plus yellow power plus red power equal american power thats the way it is the day the civil_rights movement began it r i ii was at the crossroads su and that day by the way was not the day the proud black lady refused to get up from her seat on the bus it was the day the first black slaves said no to his slave owner and that was nearly years ago the black mans fight for human rights has never been such a socially acceptable thing as it is today but it has always been in motion even though it sometimes manifested itself as no more of a nuisance than a fly on the back of a rhinoceros the thing that amazes me about the whole civil_rights movement though and my black brothers and sisters is that we have been able to strip ourselves of our conditioning and see a reality that our white countrymen have not yet begun to see we have though existing within the framework of this most hostile society dedicated to the perpetuation of black men as inferior beings and make no mistake about it this society is in fact dedicated totallyperhaps even at the risk of destroying the world to the principle that the black man will not be equal been able to rise above our negative conditioning and at this very moment although perhaps they dont deserve it we are plotting the course of saving the whole goddamn world what thrills me about us is our tremendous stamina even though they infiltrate the ranks of some of our best organizations and render them almost totally ineffective another organization is born every time they hamper the established one and that organization fights even more vigorously than the parent group and while it lives in its effective state it slashes away at the injustice about us and brings us still closer to the goals that we will attain because we are not only black and beautiful but we are the children of the most oppressed of our times and we are the ones who are aware of injustice and we are the ones who will right all the wrongs perpetrated against us and our ancestors and we are the ones who will save the world and bring a new day a brilliantly alive society that swings and sings and rings out the world over for decency and honesty and sincerity and understanding and beauty and love what are the alternatives if we are presently at the crossroads the alternatives are simple and i always seem to oversimplify thingsperhaps because i see them so clearly that i dont have to be bogged down in trivia we fight on with every facility available to us and we wait we fight on in every city and town in the country we fight on and we spread the love we have been told we cannot feel for ourselves to each and every black man we meet we fight on and we see in our black brothers and sisters the dignity they tried to tell us they had but we could never know we fight on and at the same time we look about us and wait we look about us and wait because somewhere somewhere in the tenements in harlem or from the west side of chicago or from watts there will be another other white power will increase proportionately since in this country white power plus black_power plus yellow power plus red power equal american power thats the way it is continued from page malcolm and this one wont be murdered there will be another malcom and his words will reflect the emotions the ideas the beliefs the worries the torture of those from the bottom as well as those from the top yes the man on top too because the black man at the top is just as disenfranchised as the man who walks through the alley picking up pop bottles to get the price of his bottle of wine somewhere there will be another malcolm and we will again have a universal voice but even if we dont find another brother malcolm we will still fight on because we are a people who know only one way and that is the way of accomplishment the way of victory weve never really lost you know not even a battle even the fact that we fight is a victory what are the practical alternatives to it i keep thinking of that i laugh to myself because every black man in this country is aware that our time has come yes even those who have sold out and have been granted the luxury of thinking they are white and have been allowed the accept ance of the establishment still feel something when they see their precious black women largely relegated to the role of domestics still tighten up when they see black children suffering in their inhuman world bleed when they hear of a black family destroyed because of a bombing when they pass through the area of the most disenfranchised in their airconditioned automobiles they feel their blackness they know it god dont hate them please because theyll be back theyll be standing in the line when the time comes because their blackness will not let them escape their responsibility to the brave dead blackmen who have made their success possible today without a word passing between them one black man looks at another one and instinctively they know that they will not tolerate another hundred years of economic slavery and if it means that some of us have to die to get our point across to the world then we will die but we will not die meekly we will not die without making our statement its true that we are really no prouder than any other oppressed people in history but we are the last of the long sufferers and as a result of our oppression we have gained a dignity our oppressors can never have and we try just a little harder than the man on top we do just a little better job than he does and we are a hell of a lot more alive god it must be terrible not to be born black in this day and age the fact that core and i sncc have taken difi ferent roads from the naacp the urban league and sclc does not lead me to believe that the civil_rights movement as a whole is at a crossroads where one road can lead to success and the other to disaster the older organizations are continuing in the way they have always taken using legal techniques moral persuasion nonviolent demonstrations and cooperation with whites there has been a tendency in the two younger organizations to develop grassroots leadership and power a tendency which is now coming to the fore instead of taking one road the civil_rights movement is taking two roads in my opinion this is a good thing as the problem of racism cannot be solved by any panacea it needs to be attacked on a variety of fronts by whatever tactics is most effective in a given situation our leaders have used too much energy in fighting and criticizing each other from the utterances of some of them it would seem that other negro leaders are greater enemies to the civil_rights movement than white bigots every one has his favorite solution strategy and tactics but that does not mean that other tactics and approaches are not effective and should not be used i would not consider the civil_rights movement to be at a crossroads because if direct political action fails there is still the alternative of legal and persuasive techniques employed by the older organizations if these methods prove ineffectual there are the techniques of political and economic mobilization already adopted by the other two organizations i think we should beware of expecting perfection or utopia as president kennedy said life is hard some men spend the war stateside and others are killed i think we should constantly strive toward perfection but not be too disappointed if we do not achieve it in my opinion black power means organizing black people so that they can have power commensurate with their numbers in their communities states and in the nation this will mean that they may dominate some communities politically will be a strong force in some states and will wield power in the national government this is similar to what other groups have done in the detroit suburb of hamtramck for instance the poles regularly elect a polish mayor polish state representatives and senators and polish representatives to congress the irish have long dominated boston and recently we had an irish catholic president we have catholic power jewish power italian power and armenian power let there be black power too black people have long voted for whites to represent them now whites should learn to vote for black representatives its the ability of the man which matters not the color of his skin the adverse reaction of the white press to the phrase black power stems from two things the whites attitude toward blacks and their feelings about themselves one of the things which incenses the black man toward the white is his absolute refusal to see the black man to the white he is invisible not there a white makes a movie or a television show about a hospital say where black internes nurses and orderlies are falling over each other but the picture will be lily white there may be a promotion coming up but he never considers competent black workers for the position to him the black man is invisible he does not exist or he may indeed see the black man but through the distortion of his own preconceptions and prejudice sixty years ago if you mentioned black writers to a white bigot he would say a nigger write a book how can an ape write a book today at the term black power many whites have the same reaction the only difference is that it is stated in more genteel language the second reason for the whites reaction to the term black power is internaltheir sense of guilt when you have kidnapped enslaved beaten murdered raped exploited cheated traduced and committed injustice toward a race for years how can you escape feelings of guilt and the fear that they will do to you what you have done to them a people that can burn a man cut off his genitals and toes and distribute them for souvenirs and incarcerate loyal japaneseamericans in concentration camps would have long ago reacted violently to such treatment as they have meted out and they fear the black man will do what they would have done they cannot conceive that he can have magnanimity generosity and compassion so far there is no prominent black leader advocating such violence although some have advocated protecting ones self when attacked as is every mans legal and godgiven right all men are not saints incidentally the only way you can become a saint is through martyrdom and they do not have martin luther king jrs saintly qualities and find it hard to look with compassion upon some policeman who is beating their women or shooting a child or calling them black sonsofbitches black power does not mean violence but it will give black men a sense of pride and of solidarity and will make them unwilling to continue to bear exploitation the direction which black power will take depends upon white power if white power acts wisely and with all speedy urgency in making this a livable country for every man then there will be no reason to fear black power someone has said that p the civil rights movef ment in the summer of with its nonviolent marches and its demonstrations had reached the crossroads i believe it would be more accurately descriptive of the at situation to say that the movement had reached a deadend it was time for a fundamental change of tactics the supreme court of the united states had spoken more than a decade earlier all those magnificent civil rights bills had been passed or were on the verge of passage many middle class negroes and white liberals hailed these landmarks as evidence that at long last america was ready to set a place at the table of the great feast for her black sons and daughters so that they too might eat high on that gargantuan hog known as the great society from the narrow point of view of the black middle class things were a little betterfor the black middle class that is the white establishment had enough affluence now and enough sagacity and audacity to integrate most of them and at least let them sit at the foot of the table by the time the platter got down to them only the leavings were left but at least they were at long last at the table and in substantial numbers and the leavings in collier heights in atlanta and in shaker heights in ohio and on long island and in westchester and in crown heights in brooklyn were we will admit some fairdemiddling leavings this new approach constituted a definite departure from the establishments timetested tactic of tokenism notwithstanding the french have a saying apropos to the situation which translated into english means roughly the more things change the more they remain the same the price the black middle class was called upon to pay was to become an amorphous group without roots or culture dependent entirely on the whims and quirks and ex pediences of the white establishment in a word they were to become white men in black skins they were required to sever any and all connections with the negro masses an act many of them were very happy to accomplish since they had never looked upon their negroness as a thing of any intrinsic value at a time when the unity of black people was an absolute essential for achieving liberation many of the black middle class were ready to throw in the towel the struggle was over as far as many of them were concerned the black middle class seemed to think that what they ate made the black masses fat and that when they prospered the black masses prospered automatically and inevitably meanwhile the gap between the black millions and the black middle class steadily widened at a rate alarming to those who were seriously concerned with achieving economic political and psychological freedom for the majority of black people this should have been and was anticipated by some since it was becoming increasingly clear that the white establishment never had any intention of integrating the black masses even as the country boasted of a great and prosperous society conditions in black ghettos of the great cities and in the southern backwoods worsened thus we had reached not a crossroads but a deadend in the racial crisis so now in the waning months of the question is posed is there an alternate route i think there is i have for a long time thought that there were many roads to the promised land and the tragic thing is that we have sent all our forces down a single highway and not even the main one but a detour i believe the main highway to black liberation is through a total unification and galvanization of black strength throughout the nation and that nothing short of this will achieve the victory the struggle for integration is pure sham if we do not go to the integration table prepared to negotiate from strength black strength block by block in the teeming cities plantation by plantation in the southern backwoods and the countryside black folk must be organized for an assault upon the holy citadels of white power integration comes after liberation a slave cannot integrate with his master in the whole history of revolts and revolutions integration has never been the main slogan of a revolution the oppresseds fight is to free himself from his oppressor not to integrate with him integration is the step after freedom when the freedman makes up his own mind as to whether he wishes to integrate with his former master for integration to have any real meaning other than reenslavement for the former slave the former slave must approach this decision to be or not to be a part of the great society based on a position of strength all else is total hatinhand abjection here am i old massa take me thus the concept of black power or black consciousness is an idea whose day has come it is not a new idea but it is an idea that the situation requires yes demands this concept calls upon us black folk to unify our strength politically economically psychologically and culturally it calls upon us to write our own history create our own myths and legends washington and jefferson do not belong to our black children they are not the founding fathers of black americans they are not our legendary heroes they were our peoples slavemasters no amount of falsification of history can disguise this fact our legendary heroes are nat turner frederick douglass denmark vesey harriet tubman sojourner truth white john brown and red sitting bull these and many more are our heroes and most of us have never heard of them black consciousness carries with it of course the right of selfdefense men are not free unless they affirm the right to defend themselves frederick douglass understood this more than a century ago understood it profoundly out of his own lifes experience reflecting on the time he turned upon covey a cruel slavebreaker who flogged him daily and worked him past endurance and kept him on starvation rations one day douglass turned on covey and soundly thrashed him douglass writes this battle with mr covey was the turning point in my career i was a changed being after that fight i was nothing before i was a man now with a renewed determination to be a free man the gratification afforded by the triumph was a full compensation for whatever else might follow even death itselfi now resolved that however long i might remain a slave in form the day had passed when i could be a slave in fact black power is not an advocacy of violence it advocates nonviolence but in depth it keeps everybody nonviolent it stays the hands of the practitioners of violence nonviolence which denies the right of selfdefense encourages and precipitates violence on the part of the practitioners we black folk have a deep need to defend ourselves indeed we have an obligation we must teach the brutalizers how it feels to be brutalized we must teach them that it hurts theyll never know unless we teach them black consciousness means placing less stress on moving into white neighborhoods and putting more creative energy into changing our own neighborhoods from citadels of despair into monuments of hope it means that all the harlems of the usa should be in the hands of harlemites this is the starting place for black liberation to create black politicians answerable to black constituents and not to the white bosses downtown black teachers and principals in charge of our public schools in charge of shaping the lives of black children and giving them some sense of pride and dignity and beauty in their blackness of course the teachers will have to undergo a great deal of debrainwashing since many of them are as contemptuous of black children as are most of the white teachers of whom they are but terribly bad imitations black power works toward the day when black folk will control the economic destinies of their communities it seems to me there need be no strong schism at this moment between the advocates of black_power and the black bourgeoisie if one of the principal tenets of black consciousness is economic power the starting place is with the black middle class may their tribes increase black power advocates are no present danger to them one of the great dangers clear and present is the steadily growing chasm between the black middle class and the black masses and he who contributes to this widening gap plays into the hands of the white establishment why is there this tremendous reaction from the white establishment to this new concept of black_power and why is there this violent paranoiac reaction from the poor white man let us consider the latter first that is the poor white man he need not feel threatened he has nothing that black consciousness wants fundamentally he is as powerless as the black man the only thing he has that black men lack is his white skin and that is the one thing black power does not want black consciousness affirms the dignity of blackness affirms the beauty of our blackness but the white establishment in which all the power is vested does have cause to worry because the black mans aim is to retake the power stolen from him centuries ago some white politicians are certainly threatened the white leeches in the ghetto are threatened those who feed upon the ghettos misery power has to come from somewhere since it does not create itself out of a vacuum therefore black_power must necessarily weaken the stranglehold of the white power structure especially in the black communities this then is what the jumping up and down is all about it isnt that the members of the white establishment do not understand the implications of black power and black consciousness on the contrary it is precisely because it understands more deeply than do many of us black folk bedford stuyvesant in brooklyn has black citizens and has never enjoyed black representation in the congress of the united states the white persons representing bedford stuyvesant now are threatened by the concept of black power the same can be said for many areas in the northern cities and in the rural areas of the south and every other place where black folk outnumber white folk for if black power means anything at all it means one man one vote it means an end to taxation without representation black consciousness also threatens the power of some gentlemen in the trade union establishment yes there are some unions even some progressive ones whose leadership is white and entrenched and whose membership down through the years has become almost entirely black yet this black membership is not reflected in the toplevel leadership hence we have white presidents of black unions undoubtedly some of these white men have given able leadership notwithstanding the days of great white fatherism are numbered on this earth and these leaders good bad and indifferent must be classified as being among the last of the great white fathers there has been no parallel in history to the negro experience in the usa american slavery and the slave trade were undoubtedly the crudest episodes in the entire history of mans inhumanity to man by comparison roman and egyptian slavery were humanitarian experiments considering all the carnage connected with the slave trade the to million lives lost in the middle passage considering the physical brutality connected with the plantation life during the days of american slavery the injury and brutality inflicted upon the minds and souls and personalities of black folk were the crudest aspects of american slavery the most diabolical and deliberate the white ancestry of this country took a great and prideful people and brought them in chains across a mighty ocean thousands of miles from the land of their fathers broke up their families and clans and tribes robbed them of their language broke their personalities down bit by bit and forged them into niggers cruder still they made black men believe they themselves were niggers and therefore deserving of their lot as slaves it has been a long tedious journey from slavery to this place this moment in the last part of the twentieth century far far too many of us still regard ourselves as niggers but as we have mentioned before one of the main tasks of black consciousness is to affirm the beauty of our blackness to see beauty in black skin and thick lips and broad nostrils and kinky hair to rid our vocabulary of good hair and high yaller and our medicine cabinets of bleaching creams to deniggerize ourselves is a key task of black consciousness to rid the world of niggers is the black mans burden and now we want to proclaim black consciousness is not racism it is unequivocably antiracist its firm dedication is to rid the world of racism black consciousness does not teach hatred it teaches love but it teaches us that love like charity must begin at home that it must begin with ourselves our beautiful black selves it advocates a love so powerful that it will settle for nothing short of love in return therefore it does not advocate unrequited love which is a sick bit under any guise or circumstance most black folk have no need to love those who would spit on them or practice genocide against them furthermore in the present confrontation love and hate are total irrelevances profound love can only exist between equals generally speaking a slave cannot love his master any slave who does is out of his mind his cottonpicking mind but masters have always needed to believe in the myth of the loyal slave the loving slave hence the myths of uncle tom and gunga din and aunt jemima were pure figments of the white mans wish fulfillment some black folks historically have felt an obligation to act out the image to play the coon role according to the script written by the great white fathers some of us still have a need to play the role correspondingly most white people today demand that black folk either love them or hate them so long as they do not profess indifference to them there is this pathetic need in most white americans for the black man to be obsessed with them one way or the other finally black consciousness understands that the nigger having been invented to justify american slavery ultimately became the rationale for colonizing three quarters of the human race thus there evolved two kinds of homo sapiens on this earthexploiter and exploited a master race of white men and a subservient race of niggers thus evolved such concepts as the white mans burden and the noble savage our mutual heritage with the people of africa and even on a broader basis our mutual experiences with all the colored peoples of the world visavis the white man create a bond between us and colored people everywhere black consciousness proclaims that our struggle for liberation is a part of the great revolution sweeping the entire world a revolution against all the great white fathers in every nook and corner of this earth in this context we black americans are no longer a minority but a part of that vast majority of humanity yearning to be free and struggling with every ounce of their strength to throw off the blackmans burden and the yoke of white supremacy we are a part of that fellowship of the disinherited which will surely inherit the earth in this century we are dues paying members in the brotherhood of blackness what ultimately became v worjy the outstanding result i yv of the neg r family debate was the excuse it created for a slackening of action to solve the problem that the debate was supposed to be about for a government that wanted to cool it to avoid action that could no longer be avoided without having to take the blame for inaction the moynihan controversy provided an ideal distraction this conclusion of two eminent sociologists writing in washington universitys transaction points up a lesson that can be drawn from the fuss that has been stirred up over the meaning of black power the distraction developed in the white press only after vicepresident humphrey and a negro leader who remains enchanted by president johnson kicked off the excitement by equating black power with black racism the debate that ensued has become almost too tiresome to review in detail it has been dominated by intentional misunderstandings and baseless imputations that have put some sections of the movement even sympathetic white journalists into a state of confusion and disarray a nation that should be awakened to the evils of white racism of the present day and that must be enlightened as the result of white racism of the past is distracted this year by the black power scarecrow as it was last year by the negro family fuss it is fair to suggest that a government that wants to avoid confrontation with white racism so that it can get on with the war so splendidly supported by racist allies like john stennis senate military affairs committee and mendel rivers house military affairs committee is pleased to have provided a new diversion as a minority experienced in the selforganization needed to combat persecution and imbued with the selfrespect that has provided morale for that combat american jews should have had no difficulty in recognizing and welcoming the advocacy of black power for many generations we have used in the confines of our family circle a phrase whose meaning was never very different is it good for the jews this was a touchstone for viewing political and international developments it was a factor seriously debated before every election it never stood for a parochial jewish supremacism or racism it was a way of expressing the race pride that went into the racial organization that was so successfully employed in combatting vicious antisemitism and in watering down the antisemitism of the polished gentlemens agreement variety we developed organizations which while never having used the phrase jewish power built a power structure that has contained and pushed back antisemitism in the case of the antidefamamation league as harry golden has pointed out in a little girl is dead the very origin of the organization was as the reaction to the lynching of a jew in atlanta by the same foe that the negro freedom movement is fighting today i take pride as a jew in the contributions these organizations jewishled and jewishstaffed have made during the decisive stages of the civil rights revolution one of the really meaningful breakthroughs in the fight against the racism that has characterized public schooling was the antidefamation leagues publication of a study on the treatment of minorities in secondary school textbooks what the relatively powerless association for the study of negro life and history had been saying for years was now picked up and pressed as the position of an organization that was trained in the use and application of power getting itself heard and getting its message across a staff member of the american jewish congress made what i believe was a pioneer suggestion in a paper on job equality at a core conference on job equality in it is not yet official ajc doctrine and the seed has as yet rested on barren soil still there is promise for the future in staff attorney joseph p robisons thought in particular there is hardly any question that existing seniority rosters and waiting listsfor jobs union membership or training programs can be nullified if they were built up at a time when discrimination was in effect they are tainted with illegality and cannot be relied on this and the many major official contributions made by the american jewish congress to the cause of interracial justice far outweigh the negative performance of one of the organizations leaders who resigned in a huff from the national board of core because the organization chose to investigate before acting on the mt vernon incident that incident involving a temperamental and to me wholly understandable if not forgiveable outburst by a local chapter spokesman provoked beyond endurance by the participation of some local jews in the resistance to school integration was blown up out of all proportion by the sensational character of the resignation the subsequent attacks on core did a great disservice not only to the cause of equality and justice for the negro but i daresay provoked and stimulated the very antisemitic sentiments that were supposed to have been protested by the resignation it had and has an unintended side effect it provided a lesson in the importance and justification of black power in its most basic sense that negroes are now in control of their own decisions and no longer want or need whites in key positions of civil_rights groups to quote jonathan randals formulation of the concensus of negro and white students at this summers national student association conference the white liberal veto power over thought and action that comes from a whites being in a position where he can use the threat of the damaging effect of his resignation as a lever to influence policy is dead wrong and its elimination was long overdue a temporary cessation or slackening of the support of those who do not understand this is an unfortunate but necessary price to pay this is not to say that all white liberals are evil or do not have the depth of understanding necessary to continue to be welcome as aides and participants rabbi a j heschel for one sensed the importance of negro leadership and negro decisionmaking when he wrote two years ago in jewish world that the problem is above all the regeneration of the moral vigor of the negro great spiritual resources of the negro still lie untapped black power can be the key to reaching the masses of the oppressed in the ghettoes whose untapped resources are the key to achieving as tom wicker of the new york times has suggested the unfulfilled promises of the past who is the lawbreaker wrote mr wicker the man who takes his rights by violence or the man who withholds or stifles or trifles with the rights of others as a jew who remembers that the rosenwald fund financed years ago the work and study that made possible the publication of dr w e b du bois black reconstruction i take pride in recalling that the phrase black power was coined over four years ago by the brilliant historian lerone bennett jr in his synthesis of the first reconstruction that was later published as a chapter in his before the mayflower the lesson du bois taught repeated and retold by bennett was that the first reconstruction failed not because there was too much black power but not enough as a member of the naacp i take pride in the fact that the basic premises the real meaning of black power were first set forth by loren miller then a national vice president of the association in his position paper farewell to the liberals first published in the nation and officially reprinted and distributed in by the naa cp i rejoice that the rest of the movement is catching up with his conclusion to liberals a fond farewell with thanks for services rendered until you are ready to reenlist as foot soldiers and subordinates in a negroled negroofficered army under the banner of freedom now with the new equal em vrtjrj ployment opportunity vv section of the federal civil rights law requirmg employers to hire job applicants without regard to race color creed or sex now in effect it is imperativeindeed screamingly imperativethat we of the staffsided sex hairy chests all organize immediately a male citizens council to crush this insidious sexual rights movement race color creedthese are not important but sex if men are to preserve their male way of life their traditional male supremacy they must join together now in a militant male rights party on a platform of total segregation of the sexes this creeping equality must be stopped these sexual agitators must be made to understand that feminine equality besides being ungentlemanly violates all the edicts of science and god innumerable studies have again and again proved that there are anthropological differences between the sexes that the male is the superior sex and that if the lord didnt believe in segregation he wouldnt have created two different sexes in the first place segregation is therefore right and natural let us gather behind our banner male supremacy forever and faithful to our symbol the crowing rooster march out to do battle with these ironfisted federalists in washington who would crush our beloved way of life they must be stamped outfor their own good for blinded by their progressiveness they fail to see the results of intermingling the sexes paternity suits divorce cases unwed mothers population explosions unwed fathers and worst by far mongrelization yes gentlemen by all thats right and natural mongrelization will be the result of this radical new law that forces us to give a woman a mans job can you imagine for example what will happen when a man walks into a mens room and finds a woman attendant this is the sort of thing they do in france and look what happened to that country it has never been publicly admitted but every waterloo that nation has suffered has been caused by a skirt fluttering about in that most hallowed of male strongholds the mens room another example the takeoff is delayed because the pilot talked on the phone minutes to her copilot about what she was going to wear on the flight to atlanta the copilot answered in minutes that she was wearing an offtheshoulder wild blue yonder which ought to fix that navigator the bitch you say that will be all james to the butler and she dumps the clam broth over your head the hair of which has just been cut and dutifully bandaided by the new barber with bangs when the stuff hits your shoes you dont care because the shoeshine girl did a hellova job anyway by this time youre ready to become an ugly green giantuntil you find out shes not wearing green this season i tell you men if this new sexual rights law is allowed to continue it will besides leading to mongrelization spell the end of our traditional system of separate but equal facilities the only answer is total segregation of the sexes im not prejudiced mind you some of my best friends are women in fact when i was a kid one of them took care of me but that certainly doesnt mean that i want my son to marry one now we of the male citizens council or male rights party would take care of our womenfolk just as weve always done wed keep them in hair curlers and bobby pins and girdles let them live on our property see that theyre fed call them familiarly by their first names and bury them but that doesnt mean they have to vote why should they even want to vote protected as they are or go to school much less with us they lead the school dropouts anyway you start going to school with them you start marrying them and you know what that leads to too if you marry them they cant help but think theyre as good as you are and if they start thinking theyre as good as you are the only thing left to do is to ship them back to where they came from let them lower their own property values for a change see how they like it in other words theres nothing wrong with women people as long as they keep their placeand their smell its bad enough smelling their perfume on the street much less having to sit next to them in a restaurant and smell it women simply have no right to agitate for sexual equality theyre being misledby atheistic communists who are preying on their prejudices its prejudice pure and simple theyre prejudiced thats all in fact if these female sexual agitators dont watch themselves theyre going to end up worst than negroes so what about it mr male us of a its up to you organize call a male citizens council meeting tonightif you can sneak out of the house at a time when most black thinkerswho are not necessarily negro leaders have alloted to the white man the task of saving the white man it is a rare pleasure to read william stringfellows dissenter in a great society holt rinehart winston many moral men have separated from the church viewing it as an integral part of the apparatus that sends the havenots the wretched to the gallows of degradation but stringfellow in his christian view of america in crisis is something other than the executioner who would use christianity as a noose with eyes not blinded by western lye lie the author views poverty property and people charging this society with the idolatry of money the dominant ethic of white supremacy and the placing of property rights before human rights he brings to bear some of the keener observations yet made on the subject matter the idolatry of money has its most grotesque form as a doctrine of immortality writes stringfellow suggesting that money is the basis of ones moral worth in america he observes that if one leaves a substantial estate death is cheated of victory for a while if not ultimately defeated because the money he leaves will sustain the memory of the man and of his fortune he adds the poor just die and are at once forgotten stringfellow calls institutionalized private charity a monster so heavily oriented toward its own maintenance that it has little left over to meet the empirical needs of those whom it purports to help in a word the author sees the current war on poverty as simply more political exploitation citing mayor richard daley and his chicago machine as perhaps the most aggravated example in the nation on the warfare between the races as he calls it suffice it to say that stringfellow tells white americans exactly what crimes they have committed against black people and reflects for them precisely what they themselves have become in the procss at best paternalists at worst racists he suggests that the difference between a mayor daley or a mayor yorty and a governor wallace or a bull connor is one of aesthetics not ethics stringfellows message to his white brothers conversely conveys why today in america moral black men can scream get whitey and feel absolutely no remorse over the inclusiveness of their battle cry he candidly states the massive indifference of the ordinary white citizen of good intentions is the moral equivalent of the perfidy of the white racists the profound apathy of the white moderates is ethically tantamount to the radical impudence of the white racists stringfellow contends that white supremacy must be exorcised if there is to be reconciliation between black men and white men but not unlike most black thinkers he does not see reconciliation as a likely prospect he thinks instead that the white establishment will use its military forcewhite powerand forsees what he calls the day of wrath and it is in this confrontationwhich it seems the events since his writing have brought even closerthat stringfellow summons white christians to a most specific witness which he says must surely be the same as the witness already given by so many negro christians during those long years of anguish and protest the witness of the cross if white people are to practice alas what they have preachedwhich would indeed be a metamorphosis without historical precedentthis witness according to stringfellow demands that they not protest even if the knife is at the belly at a time when moral and immoral men alike have grown tired of the gospel one rather doubts that this lay theologians message to the white man will inspire a more humane relation to self and others than did the message of the messiah for whom his doctrine is named but however one might feel about stringfellows interpretation of what white people must do it is a testament to his moral courage that he has quite impressively related to them the painful truth of what they have already done and persist in doing and for black people who can afford to buy bookswho are usually those still trying to join middleclass white americaperhaps this five buck investment will prove antidotal towards the quest for what stringfellow calls a fair share of the emptinessd llorens bernard malamud is justifiably considered one of the best serious writers in the united states his book the fixer farrar straus and giroux merely adds to the impressive credentials contributing to his present status the fixer joins the assistant the natural and others of malamuds studies of the nature and character of people times and places malamud has the ability to develop a mutually complementary character and story line by that is meant that the character and story actually flow together and seem to belong in the same book the fixer is a russian jew a little after the turn of this century the story takes place in russia but it is readily apparent that witha few subtle changes the story could have taken place in any number of localities to any number of minority groups it is the universality of the plot giving the book its broad base of appeal which makes it a really good book the jew is unjustly caught in a mire of prejudice suspicion and the law as he passes for a gentile in order to get a better job and is later caught coincidentally with his arrest for ethnic trespassing he is charged with the unsolved murder of a young boy the most moving and impressive exhibition of malamuds talent is displayed as he traces the activities and reactions of the fixer to jail the fixer ultimately becomes a martyr not because he is a brave man but because he happened to have the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the right time it is impossible to do malamud and his book justice in a few short paragraphs let me suggest therefore that you buy and read it for yourselfbrooks johnson he edge of the spia y ral of musicians probe sat crosslegged on a blue cl th his sopra sax resting against his inner knee his afrohorn linking his ankles like a bridge the afrohorn was the newest axe to cut the dead wood of the world but probe since his return from exile had chosen only special times to reveal the new sound there were more rumors about it than there were ears and souls that had heard the horn speak probes dark full head tilted toward the vibrations of the music as if the ring of sound from the six wailing pieces was tightening creating a spiralling circle the black audience unaware at first of its collectiveness had begun to move in a soundless rhythm as if it were the tiny twitchings of an embryo the waiters in the club fell against the wall shadows dark pillars holding up the building and letting the free air purify the mind of the club the drums took an oblique magwas hands like the forked tongue of a dark snake probed the skins probed the whole belly of the coming circle beginning to close the circle haigs alto arc rapid piano incisions billys thin green flute arcs and tangents staces examinations of his own trumpet discoveries all fell separately yet together into a blanket which mojohn had begun weaving on bass when the set began the audience breathed and probe moved into the inner ranges of the sax outside the sound barrier club three white people were opening the door jan a tenor sax case in his hand had his game all planned he had blown with probe six years ago on the west coast he did not believe that there was anything to this new philosophy the musicians were talking about he would talk to probe personally he had known many negro musicians and their struggles to be themselves were no different from any other artists struggles including his own things were happening so fast that there was no one who knew all directions at once he did not mind ron and tasha coming along they were two of the hippiest ofays in town and if anybody could break the circle of the sound club it would be friends and old friends of friends ron was bearded and scholarly thickset shabbily dressed but clean he had tried to visit the club before but all of his attempts had been futile he almost carried the result of one attempt to court he could not understand why the cats would want to bury themselves in harlem and close the doors to the outside world rons articles and reviews had helped many black musicians but of all of them probe adams had benefitted the most since his graduation from yale ron had knocked around the music world once he thought he wanted to sing blues he had tried but that was in college the best compliment he ever got was from mississippi john or muddy waters one of the two during a civil_rights rally in alabama he had spontaneously leaped up during the rally and played from his soul muddy was in the audience and later told ron boy you keep that up you gwine put me back on the plantation ron was not fully satisfied that he had found the depth of the black mans psyche in his book he had said this yet he knew that if he believed strongly enough some of the old cats would break down his sincerity was written all over his face holding tashas hand he saw the door opening tasha was a shapely blonde who had dyed her hair black it now matched her eyes she was a vassar girl and had once begun a biography of oliver fullerton excerpts had been published in down beat and she became noted as a critic and authority on the fullerton movement fullertons development as an important jazz trombonist had been interrupted soon after tashas article no one knew why sometimes tasha was afraid to think about it if they had married she knew that oliver would have been able to continue making it but he had gotten strung out on h sometimes she believed her friends who said oliver was psychopathic at least when he stopped beating her she forgave him and she did not believe it when he was really hooked she still loved him it was her own love protected deep inside her encased her little black secret and her passport to the inner world that oliver had died trying to enter it would be only a matter of time she would translate love into an honest appraisal of black music i am sorry the tall brown doorman said sessions for brothers and sisters only whats the matter baby jan leaned his head in and looked around as if wondering what the man was talking about i said man if you cant recognize a brother you better let me have your job he held up his case were friends of probe the man called for assistance quickly two men stepped out of the shadows whats the trouble brother these people say theyre friends of the probe what people asked one of the men he was neatly dressed a clean shaven head with large darting eyes he looked past the three newcomers there was a silence finally as if it were some supreme effort he looked at the three im sorry but for your own safety we cannot allow you man what you talkin bout asked jan smiling quizzically are you blocking brothers now i told him i am blood we friends of the probe the three men at the door went into a huddle the doorman was skeptical but he had seen some bloods that were pretty light he looked at this cat again and as the other two men were debating whether or not to go get probes wife in the audience he decided against the whole thing he left the huddle and returned with a sign which said we cannot allow nonbrothers because of the danger involved with extensions jan looked at the sign and a smile crept across his face in the street a cop was passing and leaned in the doorman motioned the cop in he wanted a witness to this he knew what might happen but he had never seen it jan shook his head at the sign turning to ron and tasha he was about to explain that he had seen the same sign on the west coast it was incredible that all the spades believed this thing about the lethal vibrations from the new sound the doorman was shoving the sign in their faces as the cop a big pimpled irishman moved through the group all right break it up break it up you people outside want to come in the other two men inside seeing the doormans decision and the potential belligerence of the whites folded their hands buddhalike the doorman stood with his back to the door now listen officer if these people go in the responsibility is yours the irish cop not knowing whether he should get angry over what he figured was reverse discrimination smirked and made a path for the three he would not go far inside because he didnt think the sounds were worth listening to if it wasnt harlem he could see why these people would want to go in but he had never seen anything worthwhile from niggers in harlem dont worry you got a license dont you let them go through said one of the doormans friends suddenly a peace seemed to gather over the faces of the three club members now they folded their arms and went into the dark cavern which led to the music in front of them walked the invaders see said jan if you press these cats theyll cop out they moved toward the music in an alien silence probe was deep into a rearaction sax monologue the whole circle now like a bracelet of many colored lights gyrated under probes wisdom probe was a thoughtful fullheaded black man with narrow eyes and a large nose his lips swelled over the reed and each note fell into the circle like an acrobat on a tight rope stretched radially across the center of the universe he heard the whistle of the wind three ghosts like chaff blown from a wasteland clung to the wall he tightened the circle movement began from within it shaking without breaking balance he had to prepare the womb for the afrohorn its vibrations were beyond his mental frequencies unless he got deeper into motives he sent out his call for motives the blanket of the bass rippled and the fierce wind in all their minds blew the blanket back and there sat the city of samson the white pillars imposing but how easy it is to tear the building down with motives here they come probe healed of his blindness born anew of spirit sealed his reed with pure air he moved to the edge of the circle rested his sax and lifted his axe there are only three afrohorns in the world they were forged from a rare metal found only in africa and south america no one knows who forged the horns but the general opinion among musicologists is that it was the egyptians one european museum guards an afrohorn the other is supposed to be somewhere on the west coast of mexico among a tribe of indians probe grew into his from a black peddler who claimed to have traveled a thousand miles just to give it to his son from that day on probes sax handled like a child a child waiting for itself to grow out of itself inside the center of the gyrations is an atom stripped of time black the gathering of the hunters deeper coming laced in the energy of the sun he is blowing magwas hands reverence of skin under the single voices is the child of a woman black they are building back the wall crumbling under the disturbance in the rear of the room jan did not hear the volt nor did he see the mystery behind probes first statement on the afrohorn he had closed his eyes trying to capture or elude the panthers of the music but he had no eyes he did not feel ron slump against him strands of tashas hair were matted on a button of rons jacket but she did not move when he slumped something was hitting them like waves like shock waves before his mind went black jan recalled the feeling when his father had beat him for playing with a nigger and later he allowed the feeling to merge with his dislike of white people when he fell his case hit the floor and opened revealing a shiny tenor saxophone that gleamed and vibrated in the freedom of freedom rons sleep had been quick like the rush of posthypnotic suggestions he dropped tashas hand slumped felt the wall give no it was the air and he fell faceforward across a table his heart silent in respect for truer vibrations the musicians stood the horn and probe drew up the shadows now from the audience a child climbed upon the chords of sound growing out of the circle of the womb searching with fingers and then with motive and as the volume of the music increasedpenetrating the thick callousness of the irishman twirling his stick outside of black fleshthe musicians walked off one by one linked to probes respectful nod at each and his quiet pronouncement of their names he mopped his face with a blue cloth whats the matter here step aside folks these people are unconscious look at their faces theyre dead dead what happened dead its true then its true a people fighting for the opportunity to hold slaves forever who were more concerned about domination by the whites in all aspects of life than about justice who had hanged slaves indiscriminately on suspicion of intent to revolt who had surrendered to mob violence anyone suspected of antislavery such a people could not be expected to abide by the rules of war where people of color were concerned there were approximately of these men in the union army including infantry seven cavalry and artillery regiments and in the navy it is important to remember that they were of four origins free men from the northern states slaves from the conquered areas of the rebellion fugitive slaves and slaves from the loyal states who had joined the army with or without the consent of their masters louisiana kentucky and tennessee furnished nearly onethird of the total number the free men were citizens of their states and of the united states and some of them were veterans or sons or grandsons of veterans of the revolution and war of the slaves from conquered areas were wards of the government known as contrabands under the confiscation acts the fugitive slaves were free after the emancipation proclamation both contrabands and fugitives were free by military force therefore by due process of law if their owners had been killed in armed resistance to the government that too was by due process of law these men of color had been caught between the fury of rebellious masters and the solid legions of loyal men they had died of disease neglect and hunger they had hidden in the canebrakes the swamps and the hills away from the passions of those who sought to drive them back to ruin they never were safe they never were free until courageous men like general hunter on the sea islands and butler in new orleans and thomas in the lower mississippi valley compelled rebels and prejudiced loyalists alike to respect them as men by putting rifles in their hands then their own courage put the seal of a great government upon their citizenship let us never forget that the condition of the fugitives who came in a great wave toward the union army was appalling if there were nothing else in the way of evidence the testimony of honorable men on that point would damn the institution of slavery completely the fugitives were broken in spirit some came alone some brought their families few had any sort of possessions their souls cried out against centuries of oppression they had been able to see but dimly beyond the limited horizon of the old plantation area they now came through the heart of a rugged and beautiful timberland where are the headwaters of rivers that flow to the sea where men learn the cruelty as well as the beauty of natural law where they feel the full force and meaning of life and must choose their own destiny here they discovered the overpowering majesty of the mountains the rustle of trees in the ancient forests the wild animals that roamed in the hinterlands for the first time many of them could stand erect and say i am a man their longings increased their horizons broadened but their fears deepened with every step they took for on every mountain path behind every tree in every shadow lurked death or cruel retribution their only hope was to reach the protection of the union armies the influx forced establishment of refugee camps around the perimeter of the battle area grant put the refugees to work harvesting cotton and used the profits to provide food medical care and clothing the army used them as laborers but it needed help and that help was not slow in coming christian benevolence had its roots down deep in america the men and women of the s who had dedicated their lives to organized benevolence had served well both their country and their god thousands now entered the portals which had been opened by the army into the vast arena of social reconstruction here was confusion and much work to be done and it was done by the combined efforts of the army and the benevolent societies with the blessing of the civil government they went straight to the heart of the problem there were men women and children many of them aged infirm and sick they had to be cared for as rapidly as the narrowing limits of the rebellion released them their only present source of sustenance was charity their only hope over the long view was education so there came into being in the towns and on the plantations from which owners or workers or both had fled training schools for labor and for life hospitals and workshops the purpose was to enrich the nation spare it the burden of a permanent drain upon charity and alleviate the disastrous consequences of the rebellion it was the chaplains under the inspiring leadership of john eaton of the twentyseventh ohio infantry volunteers in grants army a native of new hampshire and former superintendent of schools in toledo who took over the job of education and it was the army officers and privates who performed a noble but unrecorded service on a man to man basis after benevolent societies provided the money and the teachers for the schools the army furnished subsistence and transportation the benevolent societies furnished clothing books and other educational materials organizations most active in this work were the american missionary society the new england freedmans aid society of boston the freedmans relief association of new york the western sanitary commission of st louis the northwest freedmans aid commission of chicago and the western freedmans aid commission of cincinnati these organizations had in operation at the close of the war when the freedmans bureau was established by congress approximately schools with teachers and pupils in schools and orphan asylums the work had been accomplished under difficulties almost insurmountable the white population in the entire area of occupation turned its energies to preventing a solution of the problem instead of helping only in nashville and st louis did they contribute to the support of the schools there were incessant raids by confederate cavalry particularly by wheeler and forrest and the farther freedmen were from the army the more difficult it was to maintain schools best results were achieved in the west in cities like vicksburg chattanooga and memphis and in the east in the seaports and coastal areas except for north carolina plantations were isolated plantation owners were a law unto themselvesnot much could be done in the way of learning when school hours had to be adjusted to a long day in the cotton field teachers were victims of hostility cruelty and disease many dying of yellow fever smallpox and plain lack of decent food and living quarters both teachers and pupils were abused subjected to acts of violence and kidnapped school buildings were defaced torn down and burned the attitude of men in rebellion toward all efforts to assist the transition of slaves to freedom and to aid in social reconstruction of the area was no different from their attitude toward people of color in uniform they used slaves everywhere in their labor battalions their war effort was based on slave labor they used some free persons of color in their enlisted units but in no case was there any promise of emancipation they considered all union men of color as in insurrection for which the penalty was death and all white officers of these men as guilty of inciting insurrection for which the penalty was death by the laws of all slave states governor john letcher of virginia demanded from general jackson the surrender of captured negro troops and their white officers to be tried under the same law as had been john brown general beauregard wanted to execute all abolition prisoners as he called them by the garrote everyone apparently spoke of a union uniform on a negro as an abolition uniform secretary of war seddon said with regard to the officers we ought never to be inconvenienced with such prisoners this was a general order of jefferson davis as early as november supported by act of the confederate congress after lincolns emancipation proclamation on christmas eve davis ordered all negro prisoners and officers turned over to the states the confederate congress changed the rules and may ordered negro troops to be turned over to the states and the officers to be executed after trial by army tribunals it was not generally enforced because of certain retaliation by the lincoln administration there was substituted for the death penalty a refusal to include soldiers of color in prisoner exchange this led to a complete breakdown of the exchange system more importantly however the slaughtering of negro soldiers instead of taking them prisoners which had been going on from the beginning of the war was now intensified negro troops were not given the status of prisoners of war confederates murdered them at fort pillow in tennessee after they had surrendered they slipped in behind burnsides army and killed wagoners they killed them when union transports were captured on the cumberland river they bayoneted wounded men as they advanced to the attack at millikens bend they murdered prisoners at poison spring god alone knows how many helpless fugitives they murdered in the wake of shermans march to the sea they carried them away into slavery and they hanged them army correspondence makes very clear that the old practice of slave owners was continued of never making a record of punishments or cruelties it also makes certain that thousands of such cases occurred which can never be documented that continued after the war and down to the present time after the second battle of bull run lees army was in control of the battlefield and general pope was given permission to send men both to bury the union dead and to care for the wounded the men were sent on this mission of mercy but the negroes who drove the improvised ambulances and dug the graves were seized by the confederates and sold into slavery stonewall jackson carried away from harpers ferry all the negroes he could lay his hands on either lee knew about it or he was ignorant of what went on in his own army by january he was pleading that slaves be brought into the army as soldiers and two months later the government heeded his request but he had never been willing to exchange negro troops with grant and one wonders how many such prisoners of war his men actually had taken apparently the choice of murdering or selling into slavery was left pretty much to the soldiers involved the richmond enquirer said that should the union place negroes in the field none would be taken prisoner because the troops understood what to do in such cases it added that if any negroes had been captured as soldiers in the enemys ranks the newspaper knew nothing about it closely related to this problem is that of why confederate soldiers who robbed the union dead of their clothes at nightand by the thousandsand did not hesitate to take the clothing off wounded soldiers on the battlefield would not rob dead negro soldiers of their uniforms there was a specious argument in some southern newspapers to the effect that negroes had no right to wear the uniform and therefore it was not legitimately before the confederate soldier to be taken something of the character of these men is revealed by the behavior of forrest who operated with his brothers one of the most infamous slave trading establishments in the country was brutal in his treatment of negroes during the war and afterward yet was said to have had two wives one white and one black and two children by each it is revealed too by their turning union prisoners who were colored or were white citizens of southern states over to state authorities to be shot as traitors when everyone involved in the rebellion was a traitor to the united states union officers such as hunter butler sherman and others were con demned to death in absentia by the davis government by state governments and by field commanders the practice was almost as common as the earlier one of offering large sums for the delivery dead or alive of prominent antislavery leaders the interesting point is that no matter what the offenses charged against them may have been the broad base of the indictment in every case as it had been in every charge against antislavery men was incitement of slaves to insurrection the one thing that saved the captured officers of negro troops was the large pool of confederate officers in union prison camps and the certainty that rooney lee second son of robert e lee would be the first one executed in retaliation general hunter held the sons of many prominent slaveholders as hostages to make certain that his own men would not be executed if captured jefferson daviss rejoinder to the emancipation proclamation which gave freedom to the slaves was that it doomed several millions of an inferior race to extermination and that it incited them to general assassination of their masters by urging them to abstain from violence unless in necessary selfdefense if the english language means anything here was an open threat of extermination who was to do it except southerners and where but in the south there was more to this however than the claim that union soldiers of color were not engaged in war but in sedition davis and his cohorts were claiming a legal peaceful right of secession they demanded that it be recognized they claimed the right of their states to compel citizens of the united states to resist the federal authority they denied the right of citizens to obey federal authority in resistance to state authority subordination of the federal government and subordination of the colored people went together in and in the fact that negro troops had compiled a brilliant record during the war only served to intensify hatred by the southern whites in defeat make no mistake about the contribution of those regiments they fought brilliantly in a halfhundred important engagements nearly of the enlisted men lost their lives and won congressional medals of honor make no mistake either of the hatred of confederate veterans toward them it was impossible to keep an army in the south forever and the killing to beat the negro down never ceased even momentarily until congress got control of reconstruction away from president johnson negroes were killed raped and robbed from one end of the south to the other and no record was ever made of individual cases then the master terrorist of the slave country nathan bedford forrest the commercial slave trader of prewar days the murderer of union prisoners at fort pillowtook over and the whole south was honeycombed by organizations of many names but for convenience called the ku klux klan the klan has persisted to the present time it was an organized defiance of all law a government within a government without legal sanctions in its origins preaching hatred only of people of color seeking to destroy every vestige of hope for liberty justice and equality reversing the verdict of the battlefield negro citizenship for all practical purposes was transformed over night into a huge joke everything they had gained was stripped away every brutality ever visited upon their slave parents were revisited upon them the klan was organized lawlessness it was a fountain of hatred it was the impenetrable barrier to equality it was to the united states what the nazis were to germany it did not create hatred it took all of the hatred violence and oppression coming out of years of slavery and the rebellion consolidated it and nourished it through the years large parts of the south from that day to this have been under the rule of the klan it controls politics the police the courts the schools the churches the unions it represents systematized hatred of the negro the constitution and the government of the united states there is no dividing line between the violence of preklan days and klan days the thirteenth amendment became a part of the constitution december congress passed a civil_rights act over johnsons veto april less than one month later a bloody race riot occurred in memphis tennessee in which former confederate soldiers killed negro refugees and two white men burned homes schools and four churches in new orleans july they killed and wounded more schoolhouses were burned in tullahoma shelbyville gallatin athens knoxville and columbia books and equipment were destroyed with the buildings the worst of it was that the negroes were supporting these schools from their meager earnings and there was no way of restoring them early the following year the ku klux klan was organized and congress divided the area of rebellion into five military districts under an army of occupation it was little more than a skeleton force for administrative purposes having the numerical strength of an ordinary state police force it gave moral support to the reconstruction governments but was never strong enough to maintain order against the determined efforts of the klan waves of brutality murder and race riots swept across the black belt between the years and with the worst of the offenses in louisiana tennessee mississippi and south carolina new orleans opelousas vicksburg yazoo city and clinton were the scenes of downright massacres this was a veritable reign of terror with the klan whipping negroes murdering assaulting tarandfeathering schoolteachers burning the schools the churches and the homes where centered the activities which gave faith knowledge and selfrespect to the newly enfranchised negroes it did not arise from poverty of the whites but from opposition to education for the negroes to their participation in public affairs to their aspiration for equality driving out northern teachers did the job because there were no southern ones and the school system established by john eaton was broken up by lincolns hope for a change in the basic structure of southern life had failed even in the most progressive state the first to be restored to the union in july it was perfectly clear even by that time that the southern people were not going to look upon the negro any differently after than they had before unless it be with more scorn and contempt the concept of racialism was retained not that of the equality of men restraints were removed from the klan schools were segregated registration of whites and blacks was kept in separate books the federal civil_rights act was bitterly denounced and nullified wherever possible defeat was inherent in the reconstruction program because the government had no intention of occupying the south with military forces for a prolonged period a horrible wave of brutality sadism and anarchy swept over the people of color again as soon as the army was withdrawn and the reconstruction governments fell the federal authorities either could not or would not but certainly did not protect them they were helpless to defend themselves the state and local governments were apathetic even the civil war did not teach the people of the united states that the rights of men must rest upon something more substantial than prevailing sentiment in a given community that they must rest upon law and not upon sufferance upon the national conscience not upon local prejudice all of the inequities to which the people of color were subjected thereafter added up to an imperfect freedom derived from the will of the community and dependent upon toleration rather than right the history of the prewar antislavery contest of the war itself and of the postwar strife in the former slave states shows that where local government controls the affairs of men the rights of men depend not upon the spirit of the law but upon the caprice of their fellow men at any given time and that is precarious tenure indeed the idea that the degree of civil freedom belonging to any person can rightfully be fixed by popular sentiment is wrong local government will not protect in the case of minority groups or of persons it dislikes or regards as inferior or fears these are the people who most need the protection of law because they ordinarily do not have the wealth the education the family connections or any of the other intangible assets which safeguard the rights of so many against encroachment these were the freedmen at the close of the civil war state laws went right on allowing the white people to do what they had always done victims were only people of color and life was cheap the will of the community reinforced by the heavy hand of death denied them equality of public services and enjoyment of the amenities of life restricted their earning capacity controlled their lives by irresponsible private power and arbitrary police authority and permitted education for work only and that in moderation they continued to live in squalid shacks because they were not allowed to live elsewhere they were denied access to work commensurate with their ability being excluded from all but unskilled labor in the white mans economic world they served in our wars and came back to squalor and oppression they accepted it or starved or got out they were victims of economic discrimination political exclusion social rejection and inferior education it was not and is not a question of civil_rights it was unfinished business it was the survival of slavery in a land dedicated to freedom a colossal betrayal of the principles on which the nation was founded a continuation of the agelong struggle of men to be free of human rights versus slavery for control of the nation of democracy in all its radiance against privilege and arbitrary power the nation shrank from its full responsibility in and paid for its error with the lives of young men it did the same in and ushered in a century of paganism turned to anarchy the people of color had to be beaten down and they were beaten hanged burned mutilated and otherwise tortured this was the era of lynchingsthe same old formulathe same old methodthe same old objectiveboth on a grand scale and in a manner to attract the attention of the civilized world these lynchings were ofttimes great public attractions advertised in advance and attended by thousands of people between and there were in georgia in mississippi in texas in louisiana in florida in alabama and lesser numbers in other states to a total of this was anarchy a complete desecration of constitutional government it was government by men and not by law these mobs claimed to represent the will of their communities they had claimed as much both north and south before the war when they roamed the streets of the cities spreading death and destruction and we suppose in a sense they did because it is difficult to say who is most guilty the ignorant and depraved who perpetrate such crimes or those who know the enormity of the offenses but do nothing to prevent them every person who ever committed an act of violence on a person of color is known or could have been known to law enforcement agencies a high percentage of those lynched both men and women were innocent of all wrong the objective was to beat the people of color down by fear many were lynched for such offenses as trying to act like a white man seeking employment acting as strikebreakers using offensive language making boastful remarks many of the victims were framed by women for instance to cover their own indiscretions lynchings like the trials of slaves in earlier days quickly prevented any evidence being established any testimony being presented any possibility of acquittal the basis of mob action was always rumor and the death of the victim the only certain fact victims as of old were hunted with bloodhounds there was always an eagerness for the hunt that could produce a mob in a matter of minutes and a craving for the satisfaction of momentary power shown by mock trials and executions for one moment in their lives a few men could play god sheriff judge jury and executioner they would have chased their victims to hell and back if necessary for that and they did take them from officers of the law from jails from court rooms and from hospital beds mobs were frequently more interested in torture than in the killing itself victims were sometimes tied to trees or fence posts and used for target practice their toes and fingers were cut off one joint at a time their teeth were pulled out with pliers their testicles were crushed or cut off or burned off they were strangled they were roasted over slow fires their bodies after they were dead were soaked with gasoline and burned they were dragged by ropes behind trucks until the flesh was torn from their bodies women sometimes with babies in their arms and children went to these affairs mothers were known to have wakened their children to take them to lynchings thousands of people were involved law enforcement officials bowed to the will of these mobs and seldom would juries indict or convict the reasons for this roman orgy are not hard to find the africans were captured torn from their homeland and made beasts of burden in a distant land they were freed with a great deal of help from themselves given citizenship in the land of their humiliation and suffered from the gift of the ballot at the hands of their country as much as they had from the gift of their color at the hands of god more of them were shot down in the first twenty years of freedom than in years of slavery every step forward in knowledge and selfrespect hardened resistance all they ever wanted and asked for was an equal chance in the race of life a chance to be men it is a great tragedy that social reconstruction could not have been achieved in a respectable manner but the white people were drunk with power frenzied by the thought of interference and confirmed in the practice of evil deeds and doctrines for nearly a century that is a matter of history they would not have any part of it lawlessness in the former rebellious area to prevent it was appalling and to a large degree successful civil and political rights are still denied the people of color after a century of citizenship this concept of a white mans government grew stronger through the years the man of color who aspired to cast a ballot was dangerous he must be driven out or shot unless he renounced his rights as a man and a citizen we do not know how much weight to give to each of the several causes of this behavior but know with certainty what is involved and it is neither pleasant nor good from any point of view the first is a determination to keep an outmoded undemocratic even vicious political system which gives to the dominant whites complete control of local governments tremendous influence in political parties and the power to keep congress from passing laws for the benefit or protection of the people of color it gives white men in the old slave states with the lowest cultural level in the nation a great deal more power than anyone else in government they had it because they were slaveholders they have it because they oppress people of color and keep them from voting hatred has smothered the law it is the controlling factor the white people did not intend that the freedmen ever should make decisions or participate in public affairs not if they had to go to the brink of racial war to prevent it the second cause of oppression is a measure of personal happiness inequality seems at times to be nearer peoples heart than liberty itself there are millions who walk away from those who weep from those who are bowed down by heavy burdens from those who are lost in the storm and have nowhere to turn because they are despised they measure their happiness by someone elses misery their riches by someone elses poverty their intelligence by someone elses ignorance it seems paradoxical that such a large part of our personal satisfaction comes not from the richness of our own spiritual and material possessions but from the poverty of our neighbors not more than onethird of the white population of the slave states had any direct connection with slavery it kept the slave states poor it put a stigma upon labor it prevented the establishment of schools it drove the poor man out or up into the back country but the nonslaveholding population did nothing about it and one of the reasons was because they could look about them and see this large population of slaves so infinitely worse off than themselves the same held true after the civil war so long as they could keep the negro down they were content actually smug about their own ignorance poverty low level of culture and second rate achievements so the interests of the genteel politician and the redneck were joined people of color must never be allowed to make decisions or enter into the competition of achievement the white man had found his artificial badge of superiority in the paleness of his skin it was not man against man but one portion of the population against another the degree to which people of color insisted upon equality before the law was the measure of the degree of violence upon them trouble did not come from a recognition of equal rights but from their denial the third cause of oppression had to do with sex one can not dig very deep into the history of slavery or into the postwar era of race relations without being aware of its importance female slaves were fair game for any white man thousands were bought and sold for no other purpose and every place of public accommodation had its complement of female slaves to wait upon gentlemen guests slaveholders their sons overseers and apparently anyone else of mercurial temperament had a field day there was no one to whom the woman could appeal for protection without danger of terrible punishment the law provided no protection slaves were only property and rape was trespass the enormous amount of mixed blood forced back into the slave population was proof of their helplessness it was one of the reasons and a very powerful one for the fight to preserve slavery one very competent authority says that fifty per cent of the people of color in the southern cities in were of mixed blood the situation was no different after the war the grievances of these oppressed people were many and they are sickening but the one expressed with most vehemence and bitterness even today is the inability of the men to protect their women they were vulnerable to abuse by employers landlords and professional men of every sort complaint led only to heartaches at home resistance led to starvation and reprisal led to death it was the price an oppressed people had to pay for the poor privilege of staying alive white women hated the victims of their menfolk and it was the white women who would not accept association of the two groups except upon the basis of their own superiority equality was ruled out in the fourth place people are cruel and happily so they are more cruel to their fellow men than they are to animals the whites were unspeakably cruel to the slaves and they were equally so to the freedmen their victims had a will to resist which fed the flames of passion slaves were whipped and branded and castrated and starved by their owners and overseers whose will was law pregnant women were hunted with dogs and slaves who ran away were shot freedmen were whipped and castrated and hanged and burned and shot and set upon by dogs there was no one to protect them as slaves and there was no one to protect them as free persons why should a people who had learned to love brutal exhibitions give up its ready made pool of victims about whom no one was concerned finally there was the refusal of the old slave states to accept the verdict of the civil war the south always had been a land of stagnation and frustration and the negro was blamed for the whole of it the union was dedicated to freedom but the south was determined to keep slaves the union like the rest of the civilized world was moving toward free dom and equality for all men but the south chose to break up the union to preserve slavery it lost the war because its constitutional philosophy of decentralization could destroy but not create a nation it clung to the doctrine and to as much of slavery as it could salvage because it was the key to white supremacy the central theme of southern history is negro inferiority when historians continued to talk about slavery as a humane and benevolent institution and anthropologists about racial inequalities as an established scientific fact when the flag of rebellion was flown beside or above the stars and stripes in schoolrooms when men in public office shouted from the housetops their devotion to state sovereignty which never was when preachers and teachers and lawyers and newspaper editors demanded segregation foreverwhen all these things were true and the ku klux klan was allowed to flourish is there any wonder that people of color were beaten and shot and treated like dogs so were a people crucified three centuries of oppression three centuries of patient effort to attain full measure of freedom emancipation was something more than a formality it carried with it the human rights of men we failed to sustain those rights and freedom became a mockerywe pass then to a pattern of oppression much broader in scope segregation was renewed in all of its hateful forms some of which prevailed throughout the entire nation and grew worse through the years the person of color might have refuse scattered in his yard crosses burned before his home stones thrown through his window he might be shoved off the streets or abducted at night and severely beaten or have his house burned down he might be discharged from his job the bus might pass him by as he waited in vain for public transportation hospitals might refuse him admittance physicians and dentists might be always too busy to serve his needs banks might refuse him credit his neighbors might set up elaborate schemes to prevent him from buying or renting property in the community he might sit unserved in a public restaurant wait for hours to buy a pair of shoes or be tossed bodily out of a bar all of these things might happen and have happened a million times because the protection of persons and property is in the hands of local police officials they can be and are negligent in performance of their duty and brutal in their treatment of individuals who have done no wrong and they were invariably both where the person of color was concerned what could these people do when police officials would not protect and juries would not convict officials behaved like people wanted them to behave or they were not elected to office white people were protected against police brutality and illegal arrest because they were white people the people of color had no protection at all except the law and there was no one to make police officials obey the law they sat behind shuttered windows at night and none of them ever walked down a street with complete assurance of being able to get home again unmolested prejudice discrimination oppressioncall it what you willagainst our people of color is a form of social insanity it is destroying all of us whatever harms a part of society harms all of it it is destroying our government god himself gave color to man and from that color we have fashioned a single law that supersedes all constitutions and statutes the law of public opinion in a community it destroys equality when some people have to obey the orders of other people equality is extinguished the sure guaranty of peace and security of each race said justice john marshall harlan is the clear distinct unconditional recognition by our governments national and state of every right that inheres in civil freedom and of equality before the law of all citizens of the united states without regard to race we boast of freedom enjoyed by our people above all other people but it is difficult to reconcile that boast with a state of law which practically puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow citizens our equals before the law john marshall harlan had been a slaveholder he had been opposed to the thirteenth amendment but he had fought under thomas to preserve the union and constitutional government he believed in justice in equality of rights and in government by law civil_rights jf nr movement has reached ii a plateau from which can move n increasingly smaller circles toward piecemeal removal of barriers prohibiting status gains for negroeslunch counter and other public accommodation integration token employment and school integration and similar largely middleclass aimsor can begin to dig in for what appears to be years of exceedingly difficult work whose end result will be a realization of welfare gains for negroes and incidentally for other poor americans which will include elimination of poverty un and underemployment slums and substandard housing todays activists are often criticised for not having developed a master plan for achieving the latter or national social change and seems to operate best when considering local issues on a local scale the difference between yesterdays scattered sitin demonstrations and todays grassroots organizational work with frankly political aims in rural and urban areas with high negro concentration is that the organizers of the latter intend to build a national movement not a coalition with leaders chosen from the top but a national association of local interest groups who realize more and more that the future of lowdnes county negroes is tied inescapably to the future of negroes in chicago and los angeles and that their common future is tied to americas acts in vietnam and the congo this national association does not suppose a third party but a second force which can hopefully unite on issues of common concern for common good against majority racist sentiment in america it does suppose that negro unity on political questions will increase and that organizations like the lowdnes county freedom organization will become the rule rather than the exception the corruption which exists in established city politics throughout the united states make independent politics a necessity for negroes coalitions with liberal whites may follow if negroes can come to them from a position of strength the coalitionists who dream of negrolaborpoor white alliances must realize that identity of interest alone does not build unity and that differences between the interests of poor negroes and relatively wealthy bluecollar unionized workers are plain and are apt to be devisive the difficulty of eliminating the racism which causes white unity and white powermust be met by some arm of the civil_rights movement in the near future partisan politics must be avoided by negroes unless no other alternative presents itself those who urge reforming the democratic party from within must be aware that joining often means becoming and therefore deadens the reformers zeal when he must reform himself political education of the masses is a must for any sort of politically inspired gains it is regrettable that fewif anynegro political units the lowdnes county freedom organization is a notable exception concentrate on any more than registration deadlines and election turnouts political decisions are made yearround and leaders and followers must have yearround knowledge and vigilance to insure their rights are being protected the new movement must initiate actions and programs of its own while supporting those measures which will benefit their own community and the community as a whole it must be an action movement and not a reaction movement finally negroes must strive for negro representation of negro constituencies but not just color for colors sake but simply because few white politicians are willing or eager or capable of fairly representing predominately negro units since white voters will not vote for negro politicians negroes must use their unity in negro minority situations to force the white majority to elect their candidate in exchange for negro support for a goal desired by the white community the organizations being built today in hayneville alabama on philadelphias west side throughout mississippi and in watts must form a connection which allows independent action to meet local needs but demands concerted drives toward goals desired by all finally the movement must broaden its scope and its vision of itself and its condition it must connect vietnam and watts poverty here with escalation there the right to dissent with mounting pressures for consensus politics and realize that national barriers can act as fences to hold everyones freedom in when these are breached when our concern becomes the worlds concern and their concern ours we will have made a giant step toward a really great international society she most essential question confronting me is the psychological and physical survival of the black man in america i believe that it is impossible for me to separate myself from the collective survival of my people most of our problems whether we wish to accept this or not are group problems further they are basically the results of centuries of a unique kind of oppression the only salvation for us therefore is to translate our individual problems into group problems and then as a group proceed to eliminate them we must survive as a people not as a collection of assimilated freaksrootless and faceless as a writer and social activist i believe it is necessary therefore to address my art ideas and actions to the collective needs of my people it is my duty to trans ditions which our people face into form the oppressive objective con something more compatible with our physical and spiritual needs it is my duty also to help my people destroy the slave mentality which affects us all it is my duty to listen to the voice of my people to learn from them and to dedicate my life to total liberation of us all it is my duty to protect myself and my people from the enemy within as well as without i feel that there is no higher duty that a black man can perform in this society considering the condition his people find themselves in we must seek the total liberation of black people from all aspects of their oppression we must remember that our current ideas are the products of a particular kind of history a history which began when my forefathers were sold into slavery that our lives have been influenced by people like malcolm_x the writings of garvey du bois monroe trotter claude mckay and frederick douglass i would like to believe that i am an extension of these forces that i am motivated by the spirit of the nat turners the denmark veseys and a friend named herbie johnson who died from an o d when he was seventeen and by millions upon millions of unknown black people who slaved to survive like my parents did so that one day their sons and daughters would rise up take control and reclaim their manhood currently i am greatly motivated by the ideas of writers and thinkers like frantz fanon charles fuller bill davis rolland snellings and the theoretical writings of harold cruse and max stanford le roi jones writings on music and his play black mass have recently provided meaningful insights into the spiritual nature of black people there are so many excellent and relevant black writers and creative artists there is a writer in philly named james stewart who under better social conditions would be recognized as a writer of great depth and intensity of course there are also colleagues like dan watts editor of liberator and social activists and writers like ted wilson and eddie ellis all of these writers have one thing in common and that is a consummate desire to see black people liberated by any means necessary they are willing to sacrifice everything they have to accomplish these ends and this is finallyit must bemore important than any single creative or artistic trait that they may have for finally our art will be judged in terms of its relevancy to the age that produced us and the degree to which we were willing to extend it into reality in the end nothing else will matter whether it was aesthetically perfect or artful or if it lacked craft others after us will ask did it help liberate us what are the crucial issues of our times for us as i have already stated it is survival and the nature of that survival further can we survive as long as the white man dominates the world with his idea of what the world should be i believe we can not therefore we must understand that in order for us to survive we must come together as a people organize to confront the western white man on all levels of conflict we must look at this struggle from the perspective of what fanon calls the third world that is internationally in terms of the developing nations of africa asia and latin america we must see ourselves as the extension of that third world situated in the bosom of the beast in doing this we must assign ourselves the task of developing a new humanism so that we may ultimately create a synthesis of the best that mankind has to offer and thereby move to alter the existing power relationships then and then only is there hope for our children then and then only will we understand what manhood is it is not about what moynihan and other white sociologists say it is it is not about assimilating into a dying society totally lacking in spiritual substance it must be about something much deeper something much more pertinent to the overall needs of black people and if blood must flow so that our black spirit can prevail then damn it let it flow otherwise look forward to a bland existence in the wilderness of white america look forward to the pervasive mediocrity of western society inundating us and the entire nonwhite world these are harsh realities they are not intended to soothe but to create conflict meaningful conflict among a people who have generally been in a semihypnotic state currently the question of black_power occupies the center of our lives it must continue to do so everything that i have spoken about must ultimately be dealt with in terms of powerphysical psychological and spiritual black people are being asked very concrete questions about the political structure of america it is becoming clear that neither the democrats nor the republicans offer any meaningful solutions to our problems black people must have their own political structure in which to determine their own destiny the future of peoples of african descent living in america is dependent upon the degree to which these and other salient realities are understood and accepted we must give our total selves to the struggle to achieve our human rights and finally it is in struggle that we will learn who we are the many problems rj personal or otherwise which preoccupy me l today revolve around the readiness and preparedness of my new breed generation to replace its elders in racial leadership my concern is primarily within the areas of values overall maturity and last but not least ideological clarity too oftenin many nations im afraiddo young intellectuals and activists satisfy themselves with oversimplified solutions to vastly complicated problems which involve the destinies of countless peoples i emphasize this because until recently i had been guilty of these mistakes in the current africanamerican freedom struggle we are witnessing the epic rise of a people to national consciousness identity and selfrespect along with concrete historically justified aspirations for selfdetermination needless to say this movement will not wait for moderation or gradual methods of social change slogans are often strategic and necessarya psychic tonicif and when they reflect the spiritual desires of the oppressed but slogans alone are not enough neither is onesided dogmatic thinking we must constantly remind ourselves that our generation has been extremely fortunate to come into its own in this historic era our slave and freedman ancestors wouldve given their right arms to be in our shoes and we must act with the awareness that the decisions we make as leaders will affect the lives of our peopleand perhaps the worldfor years to come if we guided by nihilistic dogmamerely sloganize and postulate while neglecting the organization political cultural and economic of our peoplebacking up our slogansthen we will have failed our people and future generations it is dramatic and stimulating mounting the tribune above the crowd and screaming defiance at our oppressors amid encouraging shouts and approving cheers but it is ever so much more difficult to engage in the backbreaking labor of organizing ourselves and our brothers into the institutions which will provide the programs to guide us to selfdetermination too often we get lost in adulation and other egosicknesses forgetting that its not ones image or reputation but ones deeds which are instrumental in creating the final victory or tragic defeat within the general framework of organization lies the area of mental or philosophical organizationideology within the struggle within the ranks of the youth we have a diversity of ideologies from mysticism bordering on racism to maoism fanonism garveyism etc and some positive synthesis must be developed which will unify this babel of theories into one invincible africanamericanism geared to victory also theres the question of positive revolutionary standards and values i would warn our people that many opportunists are screaming black and brother and sister today this is now the hip thing we must develop positive values within the movement so that any demogogue who yells down with whitey is not mistaken for a black leader only positive standards and revolutionary values can arm our people against opportunism in all of its forms if a socalled militant doesnt live eat and sleep like the people then he bears watching if the brothers and sisters on the block in the bars poolrooms beauty parlors and barbershops dont know usas the sncc militants are knownthen were not doing our jobs we can romanticize about magic new culture etc but material progress for our broad masses will do more spirituallyand culturallythan a thousand witch chants an afroamerican peoples council composed of grassroots delegates dealing with concrete rural and ghetto problems is worth more than a thousand semibourgeois coffee and fashion shops a national afroamerican congress led by popular elementsis worth more than a million adulatory photographsgiant sizein militant black publications this is not meant to deny the positive values of our african and afroamerican cultural movement our music history art etc but it is merely a question of emphasis frantz fanon among others has written that colonial peoples are remaking their cultures when they are in the streets fighting for freedom also there are certain elements who would substitute culture for concrete work with the people so we have much work to do in all areas in the coming months and yearsand much personal growing however i am optimistic i have faith in our people and in our youth luckily we have the inspiring writings and deeds of the great men and women who have shaken the oppressive orders of the twentieth century the warriors thinkers and prophets of the wretched of the earth from preworld war europe to the current tricontinental revolution we have examples of courageous writers and thinkers men and women who trod the awesome path to victory or death du bois garvey padmore lenin trotsky mao fanon guevara nkrumahto mention a few and their works are available to those of us who would study the past in order to define the present and chart the course to the future what we as afroamericans must understand is that this is not a new battle that we fight it has been continuously fought since the first group of people were enslaved against their wills if we and our generation do not succeed it will continue until certain people realize that as long as a few have while the worlds peoples have not the earth will be unfit for human habitationyes the haves and the have nots when our generation speaks it is the tongue the voice of the wretched of the earth within this land black_power freedom now malcolm lives burn baby burn these are the battlecries of a nation in chainsthe shouts of defiance affirming justice and the rights of man we embody the primary issues now facing humanity whether the worlds peoples will be allowed to determine their own destinies or be policed by selfappointed emperors bent upon destructionby bomb gun or gas whether the worlds wealth will be equally shared among the masses of men or hoarded by a selfish few whether the worlds affairs will be governed by the opinions of the masses of peoplesdemocraticallyor by those of a few monopolies oligarchies or power elites we young men and women we new breed afroamericans are not really a phenomenon one sees us in the hard eyes of latin students revolting against the latest caudillo backed by the gringo empire our hands grip the rifles of asian youth dedicated to freeing and uniting their countries trampling down the palaces of miniature hitlers our hearts beat amid the vibrant passion of the youth of congo mozambique tanzania and dishonored ghana we are the newnew men and women with new visions of human destiny as for the africanamerican future i can only repeat that much of it rests upon our untried shoulders we must honestly labor and strive to prepare ourselves for the herculean tasks that lie ahead the broad masses of our people long suppressed are now stirring to life never to sleep again we have provided the slogans that shook the collective psyche kindling the flames of hope within our national heart this is a beginning the great africanamerican people are now assuming their collective personality a nation is emerging upon the stage of history woe to those who distort its aims or trample upon its dreams but we must also recognize the depths of our situation that our problems are inextricably linked to those of the american republic and through it to the world this latter problem will require all of our broadvisioned maturity and courage if it is to be solved we must take a full and careful look at the white americansstudy them as they have studied us we must realize that they are not one vast monolithic whitey but are composed of various ethnic groupings nationalities classesprogressives reactionaries liberals idealists etc we must encourage dialogue as brother malcolm did in his later years as the black_power paper says teach whites their roles encourage those who are sincere to repudiate their latent native racism developed systematically within them through the centuries by one of the most vicious systems known to man so that they can rise to our humanistic level this does not mean that we will become toms or lose our black consciousness it means that we must take the lead for the first time in history in restoring humanism to this republic for to be black or africanamerican in these times in this land is to be the bearers of light and human spirituality among a people wretchedly starved and dying for lack of inner essence and spiritual truth we wouldnt change we would still be black brothers and sistersmore so and deeper because we would function as a spiritualas well as political and socialvanguard of the future if we succeed if we can accomplish these tasks i see a total restructuring of american society into a true haven for democracy the longawaited american revolution i see a place of honor for the africanamerican nation among the councils of humanity if we fail i see utter destruction a colonial race wararmageddonwhich will despoil this republic making the fall of rome resemble a picnic destroying the majority of its people along with their great creative potential however again i am optimistic i believe that we have it within us to accomplish these tasksprovided we properly prepare ourselves the past was dark the night is long but we bring the sunrise the most pervasive nr y trend for todays i r young black intellects i uals is their vigor and degree of selfconsciousness about being black the dynamics of american assimilation have backfired and given rise to an unintended revolution black people have an increased sensitivity in reacting to the institutionalized nature of bigotry and are developing a more positive regard for black culture and community for the older black generation this has meant an escalation of the traditional pattern of negotiating for progressive changes while for young blacks the revolution means reconstituting the basic processes of u s life as they affect black people only by grasping this central theme is it possible to understand the brooding anger hostility and danger of black attitudes and actions these generalizations are based on a rapidly growing number of actions being undertaken by black people to combat racism such as legal changes sought by the naacp militant resistance as displayed by robert williams mass marches and negotiations as directed by sclc and northern urban riotrebellions rather than attempt an analysis of some collection of these actions and in so doing spell out how i agree and disagree with aspects of each i will offer a sample of pointed personal reflections as evidence for such generalizations in other words by pointing out which people i feel are sayingdoing significant things and outlining some issues of considerable importance hopefully the general theme will be made more concrete the two men most clearly embodying the essential character of the black intellectual rebellious freedom courageous integrity wisdom and social consciousness are malcolm_x and w e b du bois malcolm_x presented black manhood as a possibility not via the normal whiteorientated status channels but by emerging from the black community he possessed a style of life and rhetoric around which a movement of decisive proportions could have been assembled his published autobiography is a modern classic destined to supplant up from slavery which is still quite in demand as the negro life study to become familiar with his life shows at least three reactions to the american scene he was a nigger of the ghetto with little hope of escaping crime and a life of fear after becoming a muslim malcolm emerged as the spokesman for a position of total black alienation from american whites malcolm grew in stature he then began developing a view which focused on the problems appreciating the problematic nature of whites and heading toward a more differentiated dynamic view of american society this latter development in the thought of malcolm_x presents a challenge for someone to continue it while already constituting a fresh perspective from which to program a new black selfconsciousness du bois is the one outstanding black intellectualactivist who continued trying to promote changes in the american society without compromising the interests of black people he joined an unrelenting scientific career with a spirit of communalism for the folk culture of black people the regrettable fact is not that we have lost him by death for his was a full and productive life but the popular misuse of his life and work by ideological groups of small significance and polite bourgeois blacks with short memories albert camus serviced all men by discussing the man who rebels the one who has the courage to say no by not being black he broadens the horizon and presents the possibility of an international revolutionary spirit but there are many who are in the process of creating who are still reaping the influence of such men as malcolm du bois and camus when summarizing the most relevant writers of today it would be important to cite the penetrating insights and critical precision of ralph ellison the cathartic quality of leroi jones expressive tragedy the brutal surrealistic truths of chester himes and the colorful poetic symbols of melvin tolson these men are creatively interpreting the black experience in american life the question of what these and other writers are saying must remain for reading them or their critics interpreting these writers must be a dynamic process because the blackwhite problem is so explosive and consequently in need of constant reevaluation nevertheless it is possible to undertake a general formulation of issues faced by them one major issue is the managed illusion and destructive impact of certain popular u s american concepts and norms an example of this is the blind worship of political citizenship a practice which falsely categorizes issues into foreign and domestic and at the same time denies existing sociopolitical categories of american life the consensus and conflicts of race religion nationality and social class are what dominate american life each of these is grounded in the peculiar development of american history but at the same time is linked to an international pattern of a similar nature the issue involves the need to face problems with a more concrete less naive view of social and political reality as an example the fact of poverty in india mississippi or haiti presents the same constellation of problems for which we must begin to think of the same programs for their solutions people are hungry the people are colored the land has been raped by corrupt and oppressive political regimes the same forces are at work promoting overt racism in rhodesia south africa angola mississippi watts and harlem and we cannot promote change unless we follow the advice of claude mckay and for their thousand blows deal one death blow and similarly the barbaric death game of the viet nam war a second major issue concerns the nature of the goals of the black community with the increased potential of technology and mechanical efficiency reigning as the supreme value black people must reassess and thereby reconstitute their values in light of this baldwin has rhetorically asked who wants to integrate into a burning house black people on the streets of many cities gave their answer with the rioters cry bum baby burn who can say perhaps there was no other way for those black people to express themselves and feel confident that they were heard however if we remain on this level the depth of the problem will cause everyone to burn the problem demands that we find and cultivate a basis on which to save ourselves and hopefully everybody in the midsts of antihuman values and antipeople institutions this leads us to the last major issue id like to discuss as every major social analyst has reported america is controlled and managed by power if this be true then a man or a people without power is a ward of those in power for possessing power makes one an autonomous agent from the immediate control of others with power people need power black people need black_power the central point is that the black community in order for black people to survive and develop a positive standard of life must develop social economic and political power autonomous from the immediate control by outside forces in addition to the obvious material results of such a development even the use of the term has meaning too long the images and concepts held by blacks have been projected in the interests of others the communications media made the term black_power into a fearsome cry a veritable war whoop well thats exactly what it is but the really frightening thing is that the war is not going to be a nat turner or mau mau affair the frightening thing is that nobody knows what its going to be like the dictums of a systematic ideology are no longer relevant the dictums must now come from hopefully serious dialogue between the intellectuals use of scientific knowledge and the experience of the people or the experience of the people will speak for itself ergo watts even in light of these and other problems i can turn to the future with some optimism this results from my faith in human beings to rebel and also from the degree of brotherhood i have experienced yes the future of black people must be understood with this in mind we an ever growing number of black intellectuals are committing our lives to the black community in hopes of surviving of everyone surviving our version of the national anthem is being wailed by such as john coltrane and archie shepp our soldiers are organizers for sncc and other such organizations our armageddon is fast approaching in sum as put by black poet laureate of harlem langston hughes o let america be america again the land that never has been yet and yet must be the land where every man is free the issue most crucial v to our times in amerj ii g ica is the struggle for human rights now being waged and most significantly in our streets the black mans struggle in america is but a part of the total picture viewing other places such as south africa reveals that the struggle against racism is the most crucial one facing the world today as a black man in america i can only address myself to the problems which directly affect me i dont think black men should place problems existing elsewhere ahead of the problems in america however much they might be related the only author who truly addressed himself to the problems of the twentieth century dr w e b du bois cut swiftly to the marrow of the problem with his prophecy that the problem of the century would be the color line most of the writers who have addressed themselves to the problem have merely echoed what du bois said early in this century unless there is total social change i foresee a bleak future for black people in america without total change negroes may expect to experience in the future what they are experiencing today that policemen are required to protect a few hundred black people who try to walk down a street as happened in chicago this summer is symbolic of what negroes are now experiencing for the great majority of negroes the future looks bleak both economically and socially the white man has everything going for him at this point and he is determined to preserve the status quo one can readily understand upon looking at the position the white man occupies in america today why he will not change unless he is forced to america today is a white mans country it was created for him and he has spent an enormous amount of time and energy maintaining this structure the lesson of slavery teaches us that the founding fathers turned their backs on the black man at the inception of this country and their example has been since followed the white man refuses to understand that black people simply want the rights white people enjoy they do not try to understand this because to do so would be admitting that they have wronged a people and they do not want to admit this fact or come to terms with their guilt the rights of black people to peaceably assemble are restricted in this country as a result of the hatred of whites thus black people who protest are reprimanded while white hecklers are tolerated while admitting that the cause of protesters is right and just the establishments in our cities use every legal means to restrict protest and in effect perpetuate the denial of the rights negroes are striving for the efforts of leaders such as dr martin_luther_king jr while most laudible seem doomed to failure you cant use a philosophy people do not accept in order to change people dr_kings belief is strong and sure the tragedy is that the majority of white americans do not accept his philosophy or share his dream about the brotherhood of man acts of hatred on the part of white northerners this summer unveiled a heretofore hidden beast the cries of chicagos mayor daley and other principals of the northern establishmentconsidering dr_king a meddling outsiderare not unlike the cries from the southland shades of wallace barnett eastland and company the black man is told that he can only do that which the white man approves for example black people are told to turn their backs on stokely carmichael because whites do not approve of what he says much of the truth in what carmichael is saying is completely glossed over by whites attempts to discredit carmichael are largely the result of white peoples fear of what they have interpreted his message to be though the white man goes to great lengths to prove that the negro cant achieve his goal without aid of the white man it is certain that most of what the black man has accomplished in america has been without the aid of all save a handful of whites the cry black_power has been heard while in essence it is true that an ethnic group should control the community where it is the majority it also is true that the negro must achieve his goals within the framework of the existing society the negro must join the american mainstream as a full citizen if american citizenship is the negros goal the negro cannot practice race hatred to exclude a man from participation in society on the basis of skin color whether white or blackno matter what name you give the exclusionis race hatred black_power has a beautiful ring and sound but we cant get hung up on slogans and allow the nicesounding things men say to mislead us so long as the white majority does not fully accept black politicians whatever power wielded by black politicians though controlled by and sensitive to the desires of the black community will remain second class power the black man cannot prevail in america as a separate entity he is too small a minority but to date the black man has never been a full citizen a part of the american mainstream with that thought in mind it naturally follows that white men must admit that black men have rights which whites have to respect disrespect for black men on the part of white men is responsible for most of the racial hangups in america the negro is not attempting to win and influence white people but instead is attempting to bring about complete social change in america this can be achieved without love but it cannot be achieved without respect most white people are totally opposed to the equality of negroes in this society the mere thought of negroes as their equal caused many white chicagoans to ban together this summer under a banner nazism thousands of americans died fighting against the white man must accept black men as equals for two very good reasons economic and social progress it is fast becoming economically unfeasible to maintain segregation in america increased technological competition between the worlds nations make folly of this system which wastes the talents and skills of millions of people the future of america is completely intertwined with the future of the negro in america if the negro does not become a citizen in the fullest sense this america may cease to exist to be sure there will be a nation here called america but it will not be the land conceived of in the american dream how unlike the poland of is the poland of today and the change occurred because poland refused to make the social changes that were needed to assure longevity for the peoples dreams as a nation america cant continue to exist with vast numbers of her nativeborn constantly seeking freedom unless the dynamic change which must take place occurs this america is doomed another may arise but this one will surely fall whenever honest discussion about the negro and his struggle takes place the red flag is waved by the bigots and the reactionaries it should be loudly shouted that communismnor any other ism is not the gravest threat confronting america today rather the greatest threat rests within her own shores the white mans problem his inability to accept the black man has for too long lingered without solution the racial problems confronting america today are more the white mans than the black mans the black man is merely asserting that he wants the same rights as the white man that he become a citizen in fact as well as in law the movement has radij t cally reoriented my i own conception of the p vocation i have chosen for to be a preacher is a strange and glorious but nonetheless terrifyingcalling in america at midcentury to preach gods word by tongue alone is not enough one must seek to unleash the creative energies which that word claims on its own merits by putting ones body where once he had cast his rhetoric it is in nathan scotts inimitable eloquence to dare test the spirits to see if they are of god for certain allwhite communities in the greater chicago area remind us of the bitter harvest sown in the deceptive employment of terminology about god rather than encounter with gods children on the multiple jericho roads which bisect the city and which are shifting the boundaries of its ghettos no preacher can ease by without knowing the issues of our time and the knowing is less a matter of literacy than of identification with those whose dispossession and basic powerlessness make them as they were in the days of isaiah micah and amosthe primary issues of the era affairs are certainly soul size it is for this reason that the men of literature who have struck chords of wintered discontent and yearlong searching in me are james baldwin particularly in nobody knows my name the fire next time notes of a native son albert camus his essay neither victims nor executioners the stranger and the plague joseph kafkas the trial lerone bennett especially striking was the negro mood before the mayflower and confrontation black and white thomas wolfes you cant go home again and the web and the rock and of course the anonymous poets who distilled from those mysteries wrapped in enigmas the great wisdom of ages and with gods inspiration created the holy bible man will be in eternal quest for his myths somewhere arthur miller another author who has reached me with peculiar force has written that we must stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and on the laurels of our ancestors lest we cheapen the myth by horatory tribute to the past indeed in our own parochial experience the appeal for black_power is the quest for an authentic myth to articulate a consciousness too long dormant in the ghettos of harlem cleveland los angeles and chicago for in the houghs and in the watts of our cities there too is a nation now in labor through the traumatic crisis and travail of its new birth of freedom we can not afford to abort that event for it rages against the dying of light in all men ours need not be a tragic era if we but live it outside platos cave and in the reflection of gods intent for man namely to live in communityand in truth chicago as a case j ir t study certain predicj ii j tions can be made on the future of the negro in america first o utmost importance is that negroes are locked in the central city the consequence of this fact is not only slums but a systematic institutionalized system of subjugation perhaps in ten years chicago negroes will be divided into three categories the cogs in the system or the supporters of the system basically these will be the educated negroes teaching in the poverty program and the high paid civil_rights leaders their subsistence is derived from supporting the system through hollow attempts to rehabilitate lower income negroes lower income negroes in chicago have been colonized into a definite welfare section of the city largely encompassed by public housing the colony of negroes is supported by public assistance directed and guided by a large welfare bureaucracy as such they are told what to do where to go patrolled by armed guards and as indicated in the above paragraph are placed in a tug of war with the professional negro who derives his in come from giving them services there is a minute third category which is essentially black radicals composed of artists and activists if recent trends are any indication of what happens to this category then they are in a precarious position usually they are arrested for insurrection degraded or pushed off as absurdities there are reasons for this essentially the vested private interests in the ghetto are ostensibly the liberals in the northern city especially jewish interests in the ghetto they hobnob with civil_rights leaders support their activities openly and claim antisemitism when negroes attempt to force them out the radicals are a threat both to financial interests in the ghetto and to the service group of professional negroes the future of the negro in the united states really depends on the success of the minute third category the radical blacksor as courtland cox of sncc says those close to the community using what i here choose to call politicalcultural integration those close to the community will probably choose certain paths a develop a consciousness among negroes through cultural extensions which whites cannot interpret and which they fear such as music poetry art etc b using these cultural extensions as political avenues to organize all blacks into a formidable political base which is securely knotted by the trust in the consciousness of culture i choose to use the northern ghetto simply because the south is becoming highly urbanized and if the achievement of the politicscultural integration can occur in the north it can occur in the south or concomitantly if sncc can achieve the consciousness of blacks based on this type of integration in cities like atlanta then the knowledge can be utilized in the north the other alternative is complete takeover of the black ghetto in the north and through violent power forcing the federal government to deal directly both financially and politically with the black ghetto envisioning this process the takeover of one street instead of burning the stores and houses could perpetuate this process i mean forcing white merchants out of the ghetto thereby forcing them out of the civil_rights movement which in a few years will probably be atrophied i also envision the development of cooperatives by blacks and the rearrangement of land use patterns to accommodate new residential and commercial functions a black renewal and black planning process i dont think this is a figment of the imagination although it may sound like a novel what the world doesnt understand is that if stokely carmichael and the coterie of brains advising him in sncc or northern student movement nsm in detroit and philadelphia are ignored now then the efforts of the vested liberal interests in the ghetto and of the traditional civil_rights organizations will prove successful fifteenyearolds will be twenty in five years and they wont stand for liberalism or the welfare ghetto or phonies i am not merely parading the slogan of black_power but its time that negroes understood that a lilywhite suburb is white power not simply because the population is per cent white but because they have control of their zoning density and landuse patterns actually the planning of the ghetto by negroes induces shared power in the metropolitan area at the present the suburb is the mansion and the central city is the cotton field the analogy is useful since negroes are actually working to support the leisure class of the suburbs in the south they would kill the slave that didnt till the fields now when negroes say that they want to plan their communities it is called antisemitism or it is claimed that this will cause a white backlash after a riot when negroes rampage the streets and burn the exploitative stores cant people see that negroes dont want the stores that they would decide the functions of commercial interests in their neighborhoods are people trying to say that negroes dont know where to locate parks theaters and houses in their communities actually the bitterness arising between civil_rights groups concerning black_power is absurd sclcs and snccs home base atlanta has developed into an interesting idea of shared power in a metropolitan area obstensibly the west side of atlanta with the commercial interests of hunter street the shaded homes and the educated negroes is nothing less than black_power within a community inducing shared power in the city the intensity of negro culture that greets you on hunter street in atlanta is a landmark of what negroes can do here you can hear horace silver ramsey lewis perhaps hear leroi jones read poetry in a coffee shop all in a black community why should negroes prefer to move into an allwhite community and listen to the beatles undoubtedly as far as i am concerned black people will have to build rehabilitate and plan within the ghetto simply the other alternative of asking and inducing the middleincome negro to leave the central city and move into the suburbs not only destroys the cultural patterns that are beautiful and significant to the negro but it is asking him to give up his right to determine what is best within his own race i am wrapped up in the idea of being black as i see it the only way that the three groups of negroes previously mentioned here do not develop is that black people plan their communities from churches to chicken shacks whether america wants to admit it or not this is what negroes are going to want my little sister already knows what it means to be black at and she accepts it if because i know that my sister cant be deceived by liberalism or her friends and i want to see her live and enjoy being black means that i support black_power then i do no negro can afford the deceptions of liberalism and technological progress the only way black people can participate in these changes is the utilization of progressive methods in their own communities a real question that we a f have to deal with is i whether or not black people can act to end racism within the framework of america if not and i think not how do we get them out of that framework that is to ask where do we look to for strength and when asking that become sharply aware that there is no sense of a positive history in the black community only the negative history of being oppressed by the white man it seems to me that our work is to meet that problem with the people we work with and to help deal with it in terms of program i suspect that we will not be able to do much more than lay the foundation for the kind of struggle that black people will have to wage but we can begin to educate the people we work with to their history and i dont mean the history of the white man rather the history of nonwhite people and their role in the stream of world history i accept africa as the cradle of civilization and have to translate this fact to the people in lowndes county alabama in helping them get over the negativeness theyve been taught to feel about being black black people in this country who for so long have been told that they are only per cent of this countrys population will have to see themselves as not independent of the nonwhites in south africa or in guatemala we can no longer consider ourselves part of the united states except as struggling colonial subjects the land of our birth is africa we join with the worldwide black belt in its struggle against white american oppression it is certain that nonwhites within the boundaries of the united states will be doing different things than nonwhites in other places but we have to develop a sense of working together in the same thing or against the same thing that is while were doing different things see ourselves as not independent of each other what this lays out for logical progress the only way black people can participate in these changes is the utilization of progressive methods in their own communities continued from page black people in lowndes county or harlem or greenville mississippi is that what they build they have to control we cannot do that within the context of building a better america which is to say building for america and thats the heart of why sncc has to move towards blackness for us to talk about blackness is to talk about where we can find the basis of building within the framework of a concept of justice towards a civilized society it cannot be found in white americaat least by black people certainly black people are not above wanting decent medical care shelter food clothing even luxuries those things are not in and of themselves bad but america can only give us these things at the cost of our humanity and then it can only give us a barely adequate amount integration into america cannot give us dignity and humanity for it ignores the fact that the society we allegedly can integrate into has always depended on the negation of black people as human beings this fact alone exposes the lie that its possible for black people as a roup to integrate into america for the humanity of white people depends upon the destruction of the foundation of white supremacy this is not to say that sncc organizes around hatred of whites hatred of whites is a legitimate reaction among black people and im not going to put it down james baldwin once wrote that the aware black man is in a state of perpetual rage but sncc emphasizes that being black is not negative and that black people must understand what america has done to black people if we talk about white america about what it is in fact we can get black people to understand that there is no freedom in becoming a part of america the contradiction becomes even clearer when black people understand what they are in fact if that gets translated by white people as organizing hatred of white folks then thats white folks problem thats an expression of white guilt and a demonstration of the fact that white people are not ignorant of what they have done there will be hatred there is hatredthere are many reasons for nonwhites to hate white people there will be violence exposing the truth about what white america has done to us not only in this country but around the world could lead to indiscriminate violence or discriminate in that its directed at white oppression as artist my major problem is to do some of the same things that lsd is doingblowkeanrssm ing minds expanding consciousness black consciousness as a black artist i am working toward reversing the value orientation of the black man in america that decadent value system imposed upon him by whites i believe this can be done in several ways but one manner in which i am participating is by giving the black man a literature of his own a literature with those oppressive values of the dominate american culture diminished to the minimum the american society denies the black man a recognition of existence it dehumanizes him so a literature with black symbols relacing white symbols is needed a literature with newly created black myths and a reestablishment of positive folkways must evolve from the experiences of black artists who have sprung from the people we artists must create a literature with its own band of fantastic black heroes through literature theater and art the revolutionizing of the consciousness of the black people can be achieved as well as establishing channels of black mass communications in giving the black man his own values this aids in combating the white cultures domination our peoples sense of reality has always been distorted by definitions by whites and this must be halted i do not want a black art that is an offshoot of white art or culture or a darker reflection of the white mans hated society a completely mutated and revolutionary form of black aesthetics is needed to foster new ways of thinking and to release the pentup feelings which is the heritage of the sensitive black man black art must go against be against white psychology philosophy and aesthetics black art and ideas should spring from the black masses and should be communicated to the black masses the problem that threatens the black artist is not to become a better artist in the sense of bourgeois white america but to become something different to take on a new identity for the sake of his people perhaps the black artist should think in the ancient tribal patterns in the terms of his people as tribal units and he being the shaman sorcerer medicine man or witch doctor the hereditary relator of tribal myths tales history and wisdom one of my most pressing problems as an alleged activist would be the effectiveness of my program northern california has not gone up in flames it is questionable whether black_power is so imminent a threat in san francisco that it covers the white power structure many of the old civil_rights activists of core and sncc have sold out or are playing house niggers for some unexplained reason to the war on poverty program so to the white man the natives appear happy with their bright new beads and baubles but perhaps this is some kind of ultra sophisticated strategy or ruse and not what it appears as handkerchief headin as a revolutionary activist my major problems are partial failure and delay in northern california we are behind the leaders of the dormant civil_rights movement are sleek bourgeoisies indulged by liberal whites and on the payroll of the establishment here it seems so easy to integrate it is so very easy to get a white girl so the leaders have kept everything cool this is not an excuse on my part that nobody seems to be listening to the revolutionaries even while black men are still being forcibly abducted for that racist war on brown peoples in that land that hardly any of us had heard of before uncle sam decided it would be a good jumping off place into china the oakland police are the same arrogant beasts who protect the rights of whites and abuse the black man in his own neighborhoods they have not been put on the run up here even once so one of the more pressing problems that the black revolution seems little other than a paper tiger in my locale but perhaps i am wrong certainly i know the solution to this problem black unityblack unity for black_power to confront the man are you influenced in your personal outlook by the philosophies of any other writers or thinkers yes but not always consciously to say who had or has exactly the most influence is impossible this is due partly i suspect because living in america i was greatly influenced in my formative years by white writers that i now despise or resent for reasons of their active approval of this racist society so by attempting to reject much of this early conditioning i am constantly searching for new truths and am prone to destroy my new gods rapidly i read richard wright very early and was consciously and unconsciously influenced in my creative life kafka a sad spectre of an alien culture a hero of estrangement a prophet of dying europe was an influence for i did not know myself then this was before i found the beauty and value of my own people with their heritage and history the world that richard wright depicted horrified me at first and i refused to believe in what he spoke of through his art though my eyes told me that he was a man of truth in my childhood and adolescence life was something that happened only to me and books art and movies were something outside life i refused for a long time to put them together and i did at one time accept the american dream of which her writers so gloriously spoke i was in fact at one time a house nigger and it was mainly through reading that i came to view myself in this despicable role george orwell e franklin frazier chester himes and franz fanon have had extreme influence in my development as a black man malcolm_x above all the toilet by leroi jones and whos afraid of virginia woolf by edward albee have had the most recent affect upon me as a dramatist one was created by a black man of truth showing the reality that he knows is a black american reality that many of his brothers share and the other by a white prophet of americas hypocrisy who portrays the degeneracy of his own society a man who hates his own nearly as much as any outsider can being in the middle of this century and so near the beginning of my work i can not say candidly which writers are exerting the most influence upon me but surely they must be those whose work i am learning from whose work i use as some measure to my creation surely these writers are in the main black for this must be if i am to one day be and think completely black of course there is leroi jones but there is also lawrence neal marvin jacknon and welton smith to name a few who are the contemporary writersthat is writers of this centurywho you feel address themselves to the key issues of the times this question seems so broad if i started from the beginning of the century i could get hungup and write a book it is more of a theme than a question to narrow it down ill only mention some few in my time with reservations i include the white proletariat writers of the thirties for i believe that they thought of the black man more in terms of a social abstraction and their manifest good attitudes toward pertinent issues came from political ideology not human motives the absurdist playwrights who are actually old men save for albee who ill include in this category though perhaps i shouldnt but lately have come into prominence i include men like beckett ionesco genet etc though i believe they would resent being listed with those concerned with issues especially social or political issues in their demonstrating the futility and absurdity of mans existence they mirrored the spiritual annihilation of their dying culture so their plays of human issues forecast the relevance of social and political issues today for a new culture is about to sweep aside theirs and the offsprings of that society today in my time i was at first anxious over the progress of baldwin now i only feel quiet hostility after suspecting that baldwin isnt writing for me or to me i keep reading ellison again and again more because i love good art and w the craft of excellent writing and jones has just found himself and his direction as have many of us and though we black writers are not thrashing the same blind and dead horses it is too soon yet to place bets on the real contenders entire schools of black writers are springing up and these are the people addressing themselves to the times in which i am concerned all of the white writers today seem to be ominously quiet list those issues crucial to our times and comment on them the single paramount issue for the black man today is the survival of black people there are too many people in this world the white man knows this the white man can no longer economically exploit the nonwhite peoples any longer he has no need to he has cybernetics the black peoples will soon be systematically exterminated unless they unite they will go the way of the buffalo and the indian what kind of future do you envision for the negroes in america please state why you feel as you do unless drastic changes are made in the next decade i see only death for the black peoples in america and soon following the world unless the black man in america unites he will be given concentration camps instead of integration the relocation centers might be given the euphorism of retaining or retraining camps or such to ease the fears of those whitewashed collegeeducated negroes who would hesitate to enter the fake shower rooms with their phony bars of soap i foresee black babies sterilized at birth in the white hospitals of white america i foresee blacks being assigned the status of public american enemy supreme i see death for blacks at the hands of whites here in america america has already initiated a racial war upon foreign soil and america cannot continue to have so many dark witnesses and dissidents within its house in the coming years there will be parallel revolutions here in america the revolution among the whites will come when the pronounced fascists push to the fore to save capitalism which they realize is in its last and deadliest battle socalled liberal whites and whites of goodwill will be probably shot wholesale by the fascists even before the black man can eliminate these anchors about his neck and then white america will begin the extermination of the black man and in the immediate future there will be revolutions among the black as the black peoples liquidate their socalled leaders who fraternize with and sell them out to the whites when the moderates or liberal negroes are eliminatedthen the black people can find the selfdetermination to fight against the whites the people must and will fight for their own survival and destiny blacks need power to survive and it has to be gotten in other ways than civil_rights bills and wars on poverty it must be taken through strife let me make this clear l g i aint a writer i aint even a thinker i do sp end most of my time considering what the young intellectuals and wise old philosophers are saying in an attempt to make a decision about the right direction for me i am a social worker and being of an existential orientation my decision about direction must not only apply to little old black professional spinster me but to all the little children who come to my neighborhood house as well as the welfare mothers the members of the womens clubs and the teenage drop outs with babies bad marriages and always lots of doctor bills it seems that there are only three alternative goalscomplete annihilation enslavement or assimilation of white folks this is from a worldwide vantage point nationally if we are interested in survival weve got just one possible procedurethat is to become smoother sneakier more articulate toms and to teach our poorer less privileged brother to be less volitile less angry much much less emotionally spontaneous or is the word honest we must become the most adequate pleasing passive secondclass white folk we can be internationally if we american negroes endure the storm there may be a time when the options are ours as colored people to consider if it is at all reasonable in this era when morality is an issue of power to consider humanitarian goals to be valid then we must consider what it will mean in years after the next world war and the total destruction of civilization in the process to have to deal with a minority of vulnerable dependent whites lets face it there aint a negro alive who doesnt know an ofay he would like to save when the shooting starts the problem is that for some it might be a loving mother a secret but meaningful affair a decent boss i talked with a negro woman who lived years with a white woman and reared her daughter in the home the white woman hired a seamstress to make the childs clothes and babysit on the mothers dayoff im sure this good black woman can testify to the goodness of white folk both annihilation and enslavement would take a great toll on the moral fiber of the new society we are too accepting to start rejecting people in a total way we are lovers to the core our society must be built on love not christian love but jesus love black love is sexual aggressive demanding as well as giving tender and protective black love permits a fight but not a murder a lay but not hooking prostitution is a service for the middleclass white population it seems to me few negroes acculturated as such have ever needed to purchase sex our black_power has got to be our black love we must destroy white power with black love now lots of our performers and musicians have already found assimilation to be the best way it would appear that for the most part they are wishing for individualization right out of the negro race to the higher white side and thats not what we want then there is nothing more obnoxious than watching a black man fistfight in a bar for the purity of a white whore that is just wholesale purchase of one of the lies we must love a way that is conquering it must destroy value systems and myths and finally and maybe most important we must destroy races american negroes who are americas only melting pot wouldnt lose a thing but to suggest to the world that it rid itself of the concept of racial supremacy through complete amalgamation would be blasphemous we must not tell not a whisper but begin now before its too late the first step in the use of black love is to slap your white friend when he makes another stupid racist statement instead of becoming embarrassed and alienated the second step is to stop killing men especially other dark ones and the third step is the production of lots of brown babies and of course all will become automatic when we finally really dig love ourselves when you purchase life insurance you buy protection for aracj your family in the event of your premature death but more ww than this one fact you are also starting a valuable savings p rosam which is tax sheltered it is one savings program c which because of specific provisions in the tax law permits wealth to be passed within the family and even from one generation to another completely free of income tax estate and gift taxes you should shop for insurance as you would for consumer goods rates and terms of policies are regulated by law in most states but are by no means uniform or standard one company may offer a better deal on payment life insurance but not in term insurance a check can be made of any insurance company by calling or writing your states insurance commissioners office keep in mind that state licensing laws vary and the company that is licensed to do business in many states is a safe company with which to do business term insurance offers the most protection for the lowest premium in all but very special cases however you dont accumulate cash values many people consider it best to buy insurance at the lowest possible premium rate and invest the difference saved by buying term insurance in common stocks savings accounts and mutual fund shares one important thing to remember is that if you do buy term insurance be sure its the type that is both renewable and convertible this gives you the privilege either to renew the policy as term insurance or to convert it to a different type of policy mutual companies offer dividends to their policyholders these socalled dividends are not taxed by the government for a very simple reasonthe dividend is only a form of refund on an overcharge which brings us to the question of whether or not dividends should be allowed to accumulate suppose you are paying per year for endowment policy which has accumulated dividends of available after youve held the policy for a number of years in effect you are now insured for only because your equity in the policy is available upon your request yet you are paying premiums for of coverage you might be able to secure the same amount of coverage for a great deal less or you might protect your loved ones with a lot more insurance with the same amount of premium before you make a decision to cash in such a policy check what premium youd have to pay at your present age for a term policy or what arrangements could be made to convert the endowment policy at age when taken out to a payment life or straight life contract another factor to consider is the rate of return you are receiving for the accumulated dividends left with the company youll be amazed to learn that most companies are paying around two per cent while you can earn anywhere from to per cent by depositing dividends in a federally insured savings account if you suffer from a disability and consider yourself uninsurable take heart several large insurance companies have set up plans to cover cases formerly considered as uninsurable also you can try to obtain coverage in group contracts where physical examinations are not required at work or through an association or club offering group insurance to members you can also ask your present insurance carrier if you can use accumulated dividends to buy paidup insurance savings bank insurance is generally cheaper because no commissions are paid to brokers or agents generally of the first years premium and per year for the next nine years is paid to insurance salesmen savings bank insurance is not available in all sections of the country and even where available you wont be able to obtain the flexibility in the contracts and the options which are available from most private insurance companies gi insurance is very reasonable in price and those who do not have policies and are in a position to obtain government insurance are missing a surefire money saver if they do not take advantage of the opportunity to get back to the subject of insurance tax shelter our present laws provide that insurance contracts can be exchanged tax free there is no current tax dilution on such insurance exchanges as there is on practically every other switch of investment ie switch from one stock to another because of change in investment objectives a life insurance contract can be exchanged tax free for another life insurance contract annuity or endowment an endowment for another endowment or annuity an annuity for another annuity contract annuities are given tax protection and this tax protection continues as long as the annuitant lives on the death of the assured any gainthe difference between premium costs and lump sum death proceedsreceived by the beneficiaries is free from income tax if your surviving spouse elects to receive death proceeds in installments there will be an increased payment made to such spouse to reflect interest on the delay in making full settlement such spouse can receive not only face of the policy but also the interest factor tax free until such interest exceeds per year insurance proceeds are not subject to income tax they are nevertheless subject to estate taxes by inclusion in the estate of the deceased even though the proceeds are payable to a beneficiary but even here there is a way out all you have to do to remove insurance policies from inclusion in the estate is to give away ownership of the policy during your lifetime this means giving away the incidents of ownershipright to cash in the policy right to borrow on the policy right to change the beneficiary right to sell the policy etc you should pricecompare to get the best available contract for the premiums paid one way you can assure this is to ask the advice and counsel of an insurance consultant these consultants give advice only and charge a fee to tell you how to make the most of your insurance premiums the consultant does not sell insurance but only offers advice and will refer you back to your own broker or agent to make any changes in your coverage health insurancein the average american family medical care has become a biggerthanever expensereviewing these costs two facts will become obvious to you first each bill by itself seems pretty high and second there are an awful lot of them what can you do about it the answer isnt to cut down on trips to the doctor dentist or optometrist the costs of adequate health care has risen tremendously during the past few decades as a nation we are spending over billion each year on medical care or about for every man woman and child family health costs average about per year health economics and good health rank in importance with sufficient food adequate housing recreation and other social and economic needs and concerns of the general population especially amongst the aged voluntary health insurance is playing an important part in providing persons of all ages with health care in essence a program of health insurance is a means of minimizing the economic impact of medical care or of loss of wages through disability through the use of insurance principles which produce a fair sharing of the cost essentially this is a systematic budgetary arrangement by which a person may pay medical bills or have income continued during a period of disability in recent years the american people made new gains toward meeting the costs of their health care more than million people carried hospital or medical expense insurance in more than million of these were wage earners who were insured under programs or other arrangements designed to help replace lost income during periods of disability following are some of the more popular types of coverage available hospital expense protection hospital expense benefits provided by insurance plans help pay the cost of the hospitals daily roomandboard charge and other hospital services such as the use of the operating room laboratory tests surgical dressings and drugs to help meet the rising hospital costs insurance organizations are providing larger hospital daily benefits there is also a trend to extend maximum periods for which benefits will be paid surgical expense protection surgical expense policies provide for operations performed by physicians both in and out of hospitals regular medical expense protection these policies pay the physicians fee for nonsurgical care and often help pay for diagnostic xray and laboratory expenses this coverage also pays for doctor visits to the hospital major medical expense this type of coverage provides protection against virtually all types of health expensesin and out of hospital as long as treatment is prescribed by a physician it even helps pay for costs for special nursing care xray prescriptions and medical appliances among other services insurance companies provide major medical expense protection through group plans individual or family policies many blue cross blue shield and medical societyapproved plans offering extended coverage have been included in the basic hospitalsurgicalmedical plans previously mentioned major medical plans are usually identified by three features the deductible amount the coinsurance feature and high maximum benefits the deductible is the predetermined initial amount the insured person pays of covered expenses before benefit payments begin the insurance company then pays to per cent of the remaining covered expenses with the insured person paying the balance called the coinsured feature benefits provided under major medical plans run as high as or even higher the maximum amount of benefits per year under major policies can apply on a per illness or per injury basis or to the total amount of expenses for all disabilities under the group mechanism major medical expense coverage is provided either on a supplementary or a comprehensive basis on a supplementary basis protection for catastrophic conditions is provided as a complement to basic hospital surgical or regular medical expense protection already in force often an uninsured margin of medical expensefrequently called the corridor amount exists between the basic and supplementary major medical expense plans this corridor functions as the deductible in this instance under comprehensive major medical plans both basic and catastrophic protection is provided in a single plan and these plans are generally available with an initial low deductible amount such as to under both types the insurance company pays to per cent of all hospital and medical expenses above the deductible amount prescribed or rendered by a physician loss of income because of disability loss of income protection provided by insurance companies or through similar wage continuation plans helps replace income lost by wage earners as a result of disability more than threefifths of the total civilian labor force in the united states is protected against the loss of income by insurance company plans or similar formal wage continuation plans personal accident and specific dread disease insurance these policies protect against loss of income against the loss of income or expenses incurred by a specific disease eg polio policies and many provide for accidental loss of life or for dismemberment group accidental death and dismemberment insurance these policies cover most of the contingencies of the previously mentioned policies but coverage is available only to groupsemployee groups associations clubs professional groups etc life insurance many life insurance policies provide for the payment of monthly cash benefits in the event of the policyholders total and permanent disability liability insurance home owners policies and automobile policies can contain medical expense reimbursement provisions to cover the insureds responsibility but also to cover himself and his immediate family usually these benefits are payable even if the insured is at fault workmens compensation this is to provide employees with protection against expenses incurred as a result of an onthejob accident or sickness caused by the nature of the work payments are also made for loss of earnings and for accidental death or permanent disability sick benefits four statesrhode island california new jersey and new york have compulsory laws providing for reimbursement of wage loss due to offthejob sickness or accident medical care by federal authority medical care is furnished by the government in veterans hospitals to veterans in need or veterans suffering from nonservice connected disabilities and of course from disabilities directly connected with service in the armed forces social security disability under certain conditions persons who are covered under the provisions of the federal oldage survivors and the disability insurance act can receive disability payments if they are permanently and totally disabled dental expense policies this is the latest type of insurance protection to mitigate large bills only about persons are presently estimated to be covered by prepaid dental health plans but the idea is catching hold and more and more groups are being formed to provide this type of protection the group health dental insurance inc of new york is an example of nonprofit public plans premiums are modest a husband and wife with two children can visit a dentist of their choice and have him paid by the ghdi if he is a participating dentist for family incomes under the dentist accepts the insurance payment as payment in full for nonparticipating dentists or where family income is over the ghdi pays a set allowance above which the insured has to pay included in the overall dental care is xrays anesthesia and aftercare plus allowances for oral surgery all of this protection is available for only per month dental societies in states have started nonprofit dental service corporations as the forerunner of an overall dental insurance program the blue cross too is experimenting with the inclusion of this coverage as one of its services and is presently operating a prepaid dental plan in an upstate new york county health plans for elder citizens the insurance industry has tried to head off government intervention in the area of providing health care for the nations fast growing senior citizen population most accident and health policies have provisions for the payment of benefits caused by sickness or accident to cease at age however this fact creates a big problem the person who is over usually has reduced earnings and cannot stand the burden of medical expenses even those policies which continue to pay past the th birthday for disabilities commencing prior to the th birthday fall short of providing adequate protection older persons who had little chance of buying health insurance at a relatively reasonable cost several years ago now can get it regardless of their physical condition intensive enrollment drives aimed at persons or older have been scheduled by at least four major insurance companies during this coming year these companies do not ask any medical questions require no medical examination and either the applicant or a relative may buy the policy by mail connecticut is perhaps the first of these plans designed primarily for the elderly who could not afford the insurance plans which were available started by continental casualty in the plan spread from state to state so that by the company was represented in all states buying the policy how to get the best possible health insurance policy for the premium dollar is a perplexing problem it can safely be said that no two accident and health and supplemental coverages policies are exactly alike but what you should know is that each company sets forth the premium charge for each item contained in its contracts you should also note that while companies do offer package policies they are for the most part ready willing and able within the confines of state law to plan a policy to suit your individual needs tailormade policies have an advantage in that you pay for what you want and for what you can use you are in a position to avoid paying for coverage you already have in other policies or for coverage which you do not need you pay considerably more if you want loss of income coverage for sickness to commence with the first day of sickness actually it is the extended sickness which will play havoc with your finances and an eight day or fifteen day or thirty day policy will provide protection against the loss of income for extended sickness and will cost a great deal less in premiums many today are buying their policy protection for their homes as a packagecalled homeowner forms one of the advantages to this was the elimination of duplicate coverages and a considerable savings in premiums brokers have put up super packages which contain an individuals home needs life insurance and accident and health program an opportunity is given to pay for this overall insurance program on a monthly basis by financing the premium due with a premium financing company however the trend in this direction runs counter to the advice of most moneymanagement experts who advocate the more economical annual or triennial payment of insurance premiums they frown on unnecessary borrowing especially on a highcost shortterm basis the spreading of the premiums over the year can probably be accomplished at far less cost financing charges of insurance premiums cost from to per cent per year if policies are grouped to effect savings and the renewal dates are staggered throughout the year and premiums are paid quarterly or semiannually thus all policies for ones automobile those for the home or apartment those for life insurance those for hospital expense accident and health would be grouped into categories and arranged with renewal dates spread throughout the entire year almost as if caught up y in a national fad many college campuses a throughout america c are becoming populated with students who are referred to in a variety of descriptive terms including those of white liberal historically the growth of the white liberal movement closely parallels the enslavement of negroes in this country therefore this is not a new movement but an old one which hasdue to current social conditionsassumed questionable importance the major questions which this analysis raises are related to the social and political implications of the modern white liberal movement do the modern white liberals have the same firebrand leadership quality as those in wendell phillips era or are they instead ideological miscarriages incapable of moving from utopian theory into democratic action basically it is the quality of their social action stuff and not the quantity that will occupy our thoughts it should be noted at the outset that many of the comments pertaining to the white liberal are also appropriate for his counterpart the negro liberal towards a definition the words white liberal are emotionally toned symbols which evoke a variety of images ranging from bearded sandaled grade school dropouts to cleanshaven expensivelyshod college presidents all of whom frequently lock arm in arm in order to walk down a street and sing we shall overcome somewhere between these caricatures we may find a more representative group of people upon whom we can attach the label white liberal levistrauss observed that in any society it is inevitable that a percentage of individuals find themselves placed as it were outside of any system or between two or more irreducible systems the group asks and even requires that these individuals represent certain forms of compromise which cannot be achieved on the collec tive level that they simulate imaginary transitions and embody incompatible systhesis one of the few points that observers like levistrauss can agree upon is the marginality of the white liberal he is at best in an ambiguous position between two contrasting ethnic groups he is a member of the oppressors seeking to help the oppressed rhetorically he stands between two different and often conflicting cultures armed with hope and what at times seems to be an unsatiable ideal the american dream david danzig writing in commentary identified what he perceived to be two schools of white liberalism one whose ultimate goal is the gradual absorption of deserving negroes into white so ciety and one whose ultimate goal is equal rights of all people based upon their status positions in his excellent book the negro mood lerone bennett jr refers to institutional liberals such as certain labor and religious groups and administrative liberals especially social workers and governmental agency executives other writers place the white liberals on a continum with the philosophically wellgrounded altruistic liberal at one end and the confused but wellmeaning and ofttimes dangerous dogooder at the other end borrowing from aaron antonovskys excellent redefinition of the marginal man we may define the white liberal as follows a member of the dominant culture in terms of power and reward potential who seeks to facilitate the movement of members of a less dominant culture into the dominant culture power or powerless is the white liberal an intermediary between the socalled negro community and the white power structure thereby being able to successfully negotiate racial equality howard zinns book the new abolitionists builds a strong case for this position and louis lomax implied as much in the negro revolt the negro is committed to action if the white liberal will use his power and influence to ready his people for honest orderly response the child of change will be born with less pain less hysteria and less loss of blood on the other hand saul alinsky ralph bunche and james baldwin seem to reflect a growing view that the white liberal is but a powerless inept follower in the white community alinsky referred to white liberals as having the tendency to leave the civil_rights struggle when a fight begins ralph bunche once called them mawkish missionaryminded sentimentalists and baldwin asserted that there is no role for the white liberal he is the negros affliction perhaps the greatest criticism of the white liberal is that he is not a liberal but a moderate in philosophical disguise while the white liberal may have membership in the dominant culture it also seems probable that he often lacks power to provide negroes with the much needed social and political boots for an operation bootstraps of equality his liberal actions frequently are interpreted as being somewhat uncle tomishand indeed tend to alienate nonliberal whites including those in power positions jews in particular are disproportionately highly represented in civil_rights activities but disproportionately lowly represented in the white power structure in addition many jewish scholars have been accused of using the negro cause as a means for gaining academic acclaim and financial renumeration its a sad day a disgruntled negro leader frowned when the foremost negro experts are not negroes but jews the precarious position of the white liberal is further undermined by negro patterns of reverse segregation robert penn warren who speaks for the negro charles silberman chrisis in black and white and lewis killian and charles grigg racial crisis in america wrote about many negroes feeling that the presence of white liberals in their organizations are preventing them from achieving racial equality they feel that the sitins prayins marches and other civil_rights activities should be allnegro productionswritten produced directed and acted by negroes still other negroes feel that most white liberals are neither prepared nor willing to assume roles less than top leadership the number of white directors and negro assistant directors in civil_rights or human relations agencies give weight to this fear how come an angry negro civil_rights demonstrator asked the writer whenever we want to complain to the man he always brings in a handful of company negroes who aint even directing themselves not to mention their departments ironically often whites who assume positions of leadership in negro organizations tend to lose touch with both the white power structure and also the other members of the white community such leaders become negroized losing their marginal position and moving into the less dominant culture the negroized white liberal looks like sounds like and suffers like negroes on these rare occasions the white liberal does not have to ask what it is like to be a negro if pressed to generalize about the modern white liberal this writer would say that he the white liberal is but a shadow of the man many civil_rights goals have been lost by the intervention of the white liberal of course many other activities have been won by such intervention however it seems that his lack of complete acceptance in either culture greatly limits the intermediary role of the white liberal and bolsters the cry for black_power new directions a more effective role for the white liberal probably will emerge when the latent anxieties of whites and negroes are subjected to a frank open dialogue it is time to move away from the eternally nice but superficial conversations the goals roles and extent of involvement of both whites and negroes engaging in the civil_rights struggle should be frankly discussed specifically how much does each participant expect to become involved and under what conditions the lack of sincere dialogue is not unique to the modern civil_rights struggle as early as negro freedmen lamented save us from our friendswe know understand and can cope with our enemies we have named them we have them under control it seems axiomatic that total commitment to equality of opportunity for all people is mandatory for the white liberal however total commitment to all civil_rights activities is not mandatory everyone need not march pray picket or go to jail conversely some activity beyond intellectual vociferation seems needed in order to assure the negro masses that the white liberal is not all show and no go this activity as an illustration can be as magnanimous as not fleeing from his neighborhood when negroes move in or the equally supportive act of correcting erroneous remarks made by friends a clear delineation of his projected role at the outset would minimize role inconsistencies of the white liberal by so doing he is less likely to be accused of lacking real commitment to civil_rights as he openly ponders his next move the white liberal is categorized as being a friend of freedom who pauses and hesitates it is this hesitation that caused alinsky to prefer being called a white radical rather than liberal what seems to be but a play on words does in fact get at the esssence of the functional value of the negrowhite partnership in the civil_rights struggle because it is a fad for many white citizens the liberal cause is adopted after all this is an activity about which they can tell their chilldren and grandchildren so they join civil_rights groups without a clear idea as to what they are willing to do this basic uncertainty is compounded by such questions as how they should talk act and dress these then are the confused but wellmeaning dogooders whom we mentioned earlier others join civil_rights causes because of a clear belief in and definition of their roles unfortunately too few white liberals seem to be of this vintage thus it is not the philosophically wellgrounded white liberal who has become the model for the white liberal stereotype but the confused dogooder at this juncture it should be repeated that many of the comments pertaining to the white liberal are appropriate for his counterpart the negro liberal i watched a itu s roup of people enjoy rvw t a performance by comedian bin cosy i was impressed with the humor of the man but i noticed a very curious thing the members of the group seemed to enjoy him even more than the basic humor of his material seemed to warrant after the show i asked one of my white friends why hes just a very funny guy thats all i wasnt satisfied with this and so we discussed the whole thing in more detail at one point it developed that my friend thought that cosby was funnier than dick gregory when i inquired why the answer was just funnier i mean hes really funny just funny theres no race stuff to his material so that was it and that seems to be it with people all over america when it comes to dick gregory what my friend meant was that dick gregory made him think this facet of dick gregorys personality is his greatest contribution to his profession and to his culture of course i dont feel i need mention the fact that in all likelihood there would not have been any bill cosby without dick gregory but there have been other comics who have caused us to thinkwill rogers for example but the difference is that gregory makes us think about the most inhumane sordid unjust ugly social political and economic phenomenon in americainequality but more than that the man worms his humor down into our conscience and makes us squirm none of us likes that except those who are doing all they can to help solve the problem the reason my friend enjoyed bill cosby over and beyond the natural humor of his presentation was the fact that here was a negro comic at last who was funny and didnt remind him about selma jackson birmingham indianola etc his relief manifested itself in the extra show of appreciation and deliverance he mustered in his laughter my friend is not alone in this this same guilt is displayed by others for example a few years back the late nat cole had a very good television show that folded because the madison avenue boys claimed they couldnt get backing for the show now cosby comes along and with less than a years time in the big time he is given an opportunity to appear in his own series my point is that cosby is being welcomed with open arms because he represents a relief to the consciences of people after gregorys constant bombardment against the state of racial affairs in america they can wave cosby around and say see were doing our part but gregorys scathing remarks not only affect the consciences of whites they raise havoc with negroes also he is a constant reminder of what a negro can and ought to do many negroes like whites would like to put their head in the sand and wait until the storm blows over this attitude can best be exemplified in the comment im too violent to be involved in a nonviolent demonstration but gregory has an answer for them baby if you look up and see one of them big mississippi sheriffs with his big revolver cattle rod dog and rope youll become nonviolent as hell and it wont take long either then there is the guy who says i have a good job i have a family to support gregs comment how in the hell do you think you got that job baby i lose more money in missed engagements in a month going down there than you make in a whole year now the negro has his back to the wall just like the white person because greg not only preaches it he practices it there is a possibility that the reason that greg has all of the answers is because he knows all the questions how did he come to know all of the questions and the excuses because he too had his head hidden at one time his head was in the clouds my acquaintance with greg goes back to i remember that my first impression of him centered around the fact that he had tremendous drive and ambition only one thing mattered to greg and that was to make it this monomaniacal drive was not only commendable but was also very wise because that was the only way a poor black man could make it but somewhere between the time greg was struggling to make it and the time he made it something happened to his own attitudes perhaps it was the fact that although the mayor of his hometown gave him a welcome home parade there were places there where he couldnt even go to eat perhaps it was because he could stand up on the stage and entertain a thousand people but there were some who would not and could not entertain him in their homes maybe it was the realization that he could have a thousand dollars in his pocket the admiration of millions and the acquaintance of the head of state and yet be reduced to something less than a man by some bum calling him a nigger like most people who have been converted greg is devout and intense in his newfound faith having come from the side that makes excuses he makes it his most urgent business to now be just the opposite thats why he hits so hard and effectively he can anticipate the rationalizations of others because he used them himself at one time understanding how they think and feel and understanding fully the crisis that exists he can penetrate and pain more than most his constant pinpricking of the american conscience has caused something of an antigregory cult to arise i dont expect that it will be easy for greg to continue to be the conscience of his audience im sure hes aware of the fact that some of his fans have dropped away because he refuses to let them relax and shrug their shoulders about the race problem he by his own actions shows them how and what to do he says do as i say and do as i do but i dont believe that greg has the inclination nor desire to cross back over to the complacent let martin_luther_king do it category he is in a very strange position for he serves as something of a barometer of race relations in america for if america accepts him it will be because her conscience is clear if she rejects him it will be because she cannot afford to have him constantly reminding her of her gross failure its something of a shame that america should need someone like dick gregory but its extremely fortunate that there was someone like gregory ready and able when the time came the negro creative writj f i er in the united states i t is in an unenviable position if he like white writers chooses as his raw material his own experiences and the life reverberating around him he is likely to find only halfhearted acceptance from editors and publishers it will make little difference how well he writes or how fresh and sharp his vision if he treats his material with honesty and holds onto his own integrity what he writes will strike even sympathetic whites as accusatory if on the other hand the negro writer chooses to follow the line of least resistance guarding his work from telltale implications of his own racial identity he may find a kind of success but he is unlikely to fulfill whatever potential he possesses for artistic achievement and this is so simply because no man reaches the summit of his own potential through the conscious denial of who he is and of the forces which have formed him many negro writers have failed because they sought to write as writers not as negro writers not understanding that in a racist and segregationist societyas the american society inherently is their claim to being merely writers and not negro writers has no meaning at all for if their subjects are negroes then the facts of life in america will dictate that the racism and segregation be dealt with in one way or another and if their subjects are whites it is altogether probable that white writers know them better and can present them with more clarity depth and honesty these negro writers failed because they sought to do the impossible and their failure is understandable the critics and the editors and the publishers told them and tell negro writers even now that the reading public which is predominantly white has little interest in negro problems and more damaging still that there is nothing universal in the negro experience in his introduction to the anthology american negro short stories hill wang editor john henrik clarke says of the negro renaissancewhich covered the years between and that it was the richest and most productive period in negro writing in the united states perhaps this is so but if it is then it also means that the negro renaissance was not very rich and productive at all by objective standards but for the reasons already advanced this fact does not surprise after all the work turned out by the writers of the negro renaissance had to find publishers and publishers did not fall over themselves rushing up to harlem claude mckay that excellent poet of the period struggled valiantly to keep a literary journal alive in the end crisis and opportunity the nonliterary organs of social units floated by white funds provided the only somewhat continuous outlet for negro writing and so if relatively few negro writers of short fiction or any fiction came to prominence it is understandable yet on the evidence of mr clarkes anthology and of two other anthologies due for early publication negro writers continued to turn out short stories many of excellent qualityover the years two of the new anthologies mr clarkes and one edited by langston hughes and called the best of negro short stories little brown coare in fact surveys of negro short story writing over the past century the anthologies contain stories by charles waddell chestnutt and paul laurance dunbar who were writing before the turn of the century and stories by the negro renaissance era writers claude mckay arna bontemps eric waldron jean toomer sterling brown rudolph fischer and langston hughes himself the two anthologies include works by a number of writers whose productive periods bridged the gap between the negro renaissance and the new era ushered in by the searing essays of james baldwin among these names are zora neale hurston dorothy west ted poston carl ruthven oftord john p davis arthur p davis john caswell smith and katherine dunham also represented are the talented writers who gained recognition in the wake of richard wrights success with his first explosive novel native son these writers are chester himes ralph ellison willard motley owen dodson ann petry and john oliver killens both anthologies feature short stories by frank yerby the single negro author who found a formula for fiction and stuck to it with great financial success other writers who gained eminence in the late forties and in the fifties and who are represented in the clarke and hughes anthologies are gwendolyn brooks mary elizabeth vroman paule marshall frank london brown alice childress alston anderson james baldwin john a williams and john henrik clarke himself the negro writers of the sixties some of whom are contributors to the new anthologies promise a ringing challenge to john henrik clarkes contention that the negro renaissance was the richest and most productive period in negro writing in the united states already this group of young writers have produced a stunning body of work and many of them have only begun their careers the john a williams anthology beyond the angry black was published several years ago as a paperback and the revised hard cover edition published by cooper square will have one deletion a ralph ellison excerpt and several additions it is not precisely an anthology of short stories and not all its contributors are negroes but the emphasis is on short fiction the younger negro authors in the williams anthology are james baldwin junius edwards s p lomax gloria c oden and carrie allen young others are gwendolyn brooks chester himes langston hughes margaret walker and richard wright white contributors to the williams anthology are john howard griffin the late shirley jackson abram kardiner and lionel ovesey seymour krim dennis lynds john w mcreynolds and paul olsen the hughes and clarke anthologies boast fine new writers who have been read principally in little magazines notably negro digest among this group are martin j hamer conrad kent rivers ernest j gaines pearl crayton mike thelwell and woodie king jr the new and powerful writers of the sixties whose works are in the clarke and hughes anthologies are ronald l fair lerone bennett jr william melvin kelley paule marshall ronald milner robert boles kristin hunter charles wright ernest j gaines and leroi jones all of these writers also have produced novels or books of essays plays biography and history completing the entire list of authors represented in all three new books are loyle hairston alice walker sylvester leaks albert murray charlie russell r j meaddough iii clifford vincent johnson cyrus colter hoyt w fuller and lindsay patterson only a few of the stories are famous the hughes anthology reprints this morning this evening so soon one of the finest of james baldwins fictional works the anthology also includes frank yerbys short story health card which won an o henry award and launched mr yerbys career the clarke anthology includes a sketch it is not really a story by the late great w e b du bois whose career as novelist essayist historian polemicist and bibliographer spanned several generations before his death in ghana on the eve of the march on washington the hughes anthology features a story by the legendary jean toomer often called the best creative writer cane of the negro renaissance period the fairskinned mr toomer apparently stopped writing and rumor has it retired to a country squires life in rural pennsylvania for those who have never read or have forgotten richard wrights early story of black and white communists in mississippi in the thirties bright and morning star will prove a revelation all the power and anger of the writers great talent leap out from the pages and seize the reader and it is not protestas the critics have labeled it it is a great bitter moving story it is reprinted in mr clarkes anthology of the newer writers those who seem to most effectively have mastered the art of short fiction are ernest j gaines paule marshall william melvin kelley and martin j hamer but then they are all good writers period and three of them have published excellent novels the stories in the three anthologies range all over america the west indies europe and africa and there is no single guiding rule by which they may be measured they are in fact as rich and varied and complex as life itself taken together the stories and articles and poems in beyond the angry black the best of negro short stories and american negro short stories tell more about the history of negroes in americaand of their relationship with whites than shelves of volumes of history and sociologyhwf i recall upon meeting m b tolson at the fisk writers conference last spring asking him if he accepted the label given him by karl shapiro the poet who writes in negrowell my boy he answered youll see this afternoon and his generous smile although halfteasing was like his voicewithout a trace of condescension it was certain that the afternoon would affirm what i had surmised one sensed in the dancing eyes that guided his finally weary frame not mere longevity but rare vision and a sense of life his presence was gently humbling evoking joy pride and a most exact anxiety the way he said my boy with such warm affection lingers yet not inspired by me personally i think but rather an extension of the warmth shared by thousands of young black people whose fortune it was to be counted among his students suddenly i felt cheatedculturally deprived yesthat i had not been one of them and moreover cheated because m b tolson had in fact been hidden from me as shapiro has written a great poet has been living in our midst for decades and is almost totally unknown on sunday august dr melvin b tolson poet laureate of liberia distinguished professor of the humanities at tuskegee institute was taken from us succumbing to a long battle with cancer my heart was saddened but amid the sadness there is gladness in the realization that my heart however briefly was among those touched by m b tolson the word charisma comes to mind but not unlike other words that come to mind is insufficient in capturing the spiritgiving force conveyed by tolson a man whose absence from our minds and our lives while with us is but another chapter in this unspeakably bitter travail i recall an associate in a telephone conversation saying to mr tolson we need you it was a fitting tribute to a man whose works speak profoundly of his years for me meeting m b tolson was like experiencing a contemporary nat turner a man whose message to black people could not be encouraged the street was full when the young couple entered the chinese restaurant it was a favorite place to them because the neighborhood had been recently integrated and they could not afford the luxury of exploring some of the more interesting places it was a chilly day the sky was hard and cloudy im really famished helen said that makes two of us oliver replied a waiter met them at the door they knew exactly where they wanted to sit several of the waiters gave them warm nods of approval as they pointed to a table near the kitchen gerald oliver his eyes gleaming studied his bride she now held a menu and began to read aloud her face was round and attractive and her dimples gave hei a youthful appearance what about sweet and soui pork id rather have neckbones he said jokingly okay sweets what about some subgum and pork fine you want egg rolls baby and id like some tea right now mr oliver the waiter took their order and suggested

tell that hed had too much alcohol give those folks what they want he instructed the waiter yes said the waiter were okay oliver said he was a thin quietspoken fellow the old man arose and walked over to their table youd better let me buy you a drink or ill steal that pretty girl from you he laughed not if i can help it oliver said helen did not like the odor of the old man he was dressed sloppily and spoke too coarsely for her taste but he seemed determined to win them over listen im just an old bore said the old man but i like you people may i join you for a second okay helen she reluctantly nodded approval to oliver the old man reached over and touched helens face the waiter who was returning with their meal sensed trouble helen jerked her face away sir the waiter said ill put your drink on your table put it here the old man shouted these beautiful people aint afraid of me are you oliver just smiled the waiter served the young couple and shook his head i love people with color in their skins he said why the hell you think im here most every week for the waiter removed himself with oriental dignity you live in the neighborhood asked oliver helen was disturbed she hated embarrassing situations however the few other customers did not seem to be taking notice forty years thats nice nice nice nice is that all you can say to an old white man hell i can remember when you people couldnt work around here still cant said oliver he lita cigarette helen had dished up her food and began serving olivers plate the old man watched how gracefully she handled the food thats a lovely piece of woman you got there whats your name oliver made the formal introductions the old man got up and shook hands with both of them then he sat down again why dont you let me buy you a drink the waiter had returned to check the table helen asked for more tea this neighborhoods gonna be colored soon not with the way rent is around here helen remarked you people can afford it all right look

buildings around here thats nice said oliver like hell it is we got all jews whats so bad about that the old man watched them closely he broke into a wide smile first it was all wops and swedes then the neighborhood went to pot helen watched the expression on his face slowly change she had been right about him the first time she thought then you people came i like colored all right meg my wife

singmg i think wed better leave now said helen the waiter brought the old man his drink they watched how carefully he sipped it then without thinking he reached across the table and rubbed the side of helens face oliver signaled for the waiter they paid their check and got up from the table after the waiter returned with their change the old man did not notice them when they left he was still talking to himself when they walked out into the night air helen still felt the old mans hand upon her face and she hated his white skin even more e deeply appreciate y wjsj the honor that deyv volves upon us at the first world festival of negro arts to welcome so many talents from the four continents from the four horizons of the spirit but what honors us most of all and what constitutes your greatest merit is the fact that you will have participated in an undertaking much more revolutionary than the exploration of the cosmos the elaboration of a new humanism which this time will include the totality of humanity on the planet earth senegal welcomes you therefore as distinguished guests and first of all dakar greets you thus fulfilling its mission for dakar a black plowshare cast in the fertile ocean has always answered the call of the tradewinds and welcomed visitors arriving by sea or by air thus we can enter into a dialogue the mainspring of civilizations or at any rate of culture here we are here you are assembled ethnologists and sociologists historians and linguists writers and artists your task will be to seek out to spell out the junction of negro art in the life of the black man the function or rather the signs but basically you will probe beyond those signs to discover their meaning today more modestly as an old militant of nigritude i should like to say less about the function and meaning of negro artwhich i have tried to treat elsewherethan about the function and significance that we senegalese attribute to this first world festival of negro arts in a word if we have assumed the terrible responsibility of organizing this festival it is for the defense and illustration of nigritude for people are continuing here and there throughout the world to deny african art as well as negritude by which i mean the negro values of civilization and when they can no longer deny negro art because it is so evident they try to contest its originality its human truth african art has been denied on the pretext that it presents different forms and in fact if it is indeed an entity it is in the diversity of its fields its types even its styles like european art which under its italian french german russian or swedish appearance derives from grecolatin civilization from discursive reason animated by christianity like european art which subjected to frequent revolutions nevertheless remains european in its fundamental characteristics to return to african art it is all the more a unit because if its function is always to actualize its object i mean its matter its nature on the contrary is always to express this object by means of the same signs in the same profound style which is precisely to stylize it as a result one can not long deny negro art because the europeans themselves were the first to discover and to define itthe negro africans preferred to live it the most eminent european artists and writers defended it from pablo picasso to andre malraux whose presence here i salute as conclusive evidence and i need not speak about the african and american negro writers and artists who between the two world wars and since have won the attention of a world torn apart and which because it was tom asunder was seeking its unity its authenticity unable then to deny negro art they have tried to minimize its originality claiming that it had no monopoly either over emotion or over the analogical image not even over the rhvthm and it is true that every genuine artist has these gifts whatever his continent his race his nation may be nevertheless rimbaud had to claim kinship with negritude picasso had to be overwhelmed by a baoule mask apollinaire had to sing of wooden fetishes before western european art would consent after two thousand years to abandon physeds mimesis the imitation of nature it is in large measure the fault of negro arta very fortunate fruitful faultthat the artists of that same western world are inspired today like bazaine by the kmost obscure effort of instinct and sen sitivity and that like masson they define the work of art as a simple play of forms and values that are legibly organized in brief a simply rhythm a play of forces my friend soulages would have said because rhythm is harmonious movement in that it signifies forms but it is not only a question of defending the negro art of the past as it is exhibited today in the musee dynamique it is even more a matter of making it illustrious by showing what it is in the middle of the twentieth century a gusher that does not run dry a basic significant element of the civilization of the universal which is being constructed before our eyes by us and for us by all and for all and first of all for the negro writers and artists as is evidenced by the exposition of contemporary art which bears the meaningful title tendencies and confrontation and so after the first and then the second world war from everywhereafrica america and the very heart of europeyoung black men and girls have risen like young trees pruned by those two wars from the depth of their ancestral experiences from the depth of their more recent experiences as slaves and as colonized people or simply as men of this century wide open to all contributions they have discovered along with a new vision of the world the new words of the new negro words that they provided their works did not need to be placed in anthologies or in museums to fulfill that function which is to express life to represent it so as to help men all men to live better to help their black brothers before all others think of the former black slaves of america deported from mother africa if they did not surrender to the taedium vitae tedium of life if they did not give up like other races destined to die in weak sorrowful languor it was because they had carried within them from the motherland along with the lust for life that creative power which is the original trademark of art for art is nothing other than this primal gesture of homo sapiens thinking man who representing life by the symbolic image intensifies it by rhythm thus magnifying it to give it the value of eternity such at least is negro art and to refer again to the negro americans the art of negro spirituals and the blues the most ordinary labor of the peasant the most painful labor of the slave vivified because it is magnified by the word by the song by the dance by the rhythmic energy which is the very stuff of life but slavery belongs to the past today in senegal to take a current example the new national art rooted in the black basalt of cap vert is being built up once again in dakar a crossroads swept by all the pollens in the world as well as by images and ideas saving us from despair this negro art sustains us in our effort toward economic and social development in our determination to live so too do our poets short story writers and novelists our singers and dancers our painters and sculptors our musicians whether they paint violent mystical abstractions or the noble elegance of royal african courtships whether they sculpt the national lion or fantastic monsters whether they dance the development plan or sing the diversification of crops the negro african artists the senegalese artists of today help us to live today to live a better more abundant life to live more that is to say more intensely reinforcing the high tension that characterized the north suda nese negro african civilization to live better in order to resolve the concrete problems that condition our future listening to me one might believe that negro art is only a technique an ensemble of means at the service of a civilization of the comfortable or in any case at the service of material production let me explain i have spoken not merely of economic growth but of development that is to say the correlative and complementary totality of matter and spirit of the economic and social of the body and the soul i have spoken at the same time of the production of material goods and spiritual goods when i speak of negritude i am referring to a civilization where art is at once technique and vision handicraft and prophecy where art expresses in the words of ogotemmeli the identity of material gestures and spiritual forces the same aged negro said the other day the weaver sings as he pushes his shuttle and his voice continues the chain aiding and leading the chant of the ancestors this means simply that all art in black africa weaving sculpture painting music and danceis speech or better still the wrd mean poetry in fact form and colors timbres and tones movement even the materials used by the artists have the effectiveness of the word provided they are rhythmic for speech having become the word because it has the rhythm of the primeval movement the form of things named recreates them makes them more present more true thus it accomplishes the action of the creator because by renewing that action it prolongs it by art which once again eternizes the life of things and beings by vivifying and magnifying that life beyond its vital function this is the significance of negro art it makes us resemble god by having us participate in its creation i have almost finished by helping the defense and illustration of negro art senegal is conscious of helping to build the civilization of the universal in fact even before our national independence during the past twenty years or so we have never stopped basing our policy on dialogue in all fields and essentially in the realm of culture for culture is the first requisite and the final objective of all development but to dialogue with others to take part in the common work of conscientious determined men who springing up everywhere in the world to bring new values to the symbiosis of complementary values by which the civilization of the universal is determined we negroes need to be ourselves at long last in our dignity our regained identity to be ourselves by cultivating our own values as we have rediscovered them in the sources of negro art because those values spring from biological geographical and historical data they are over and beyond the profound unity of humanity the hallmark of our originality in thought feeling and action to be ourselves not without borrowing not by procuration but rather by our own personal and collective effort and for ourselves otherwise we should merely be poor copies of others in the musee vivant as the negroes of america were in slavery days until the end of the nineteenth century just as we african negroes were in the days of colonization until the eve of the second world war between the two world wars what the young black men and girls of my generation wanted was to abandon the imitative spirit of the old regime to regain along with the sentiment of our dignity the creative spirit which had been for thousands of years the seal of negritude as revealed by the rupestrian art of the african continent we meant to become once again producers of civilization like our ancestors for we were conscious of the fact that the humanism of the twentieth century which can only be the civilization of the universal would be impoverished if it excluded a single continent once again the problem is posed in terms of complementarity of dialogue and interchange not of opposition or racial hatred moreover how could we negroes reject the scientific and technical discoveries of the european and north american peoples thanks to those discoveries man is seen transforming man himself as well as nature ladies and gentlemen you researchers and professors artists and writers are the real humanists of the present day because senegal has chosen to be the fatherland of dialogue and interchange senegal wishes to be your second country in any event it hopes that the great dialogue that begins here today will contribute to the construction of the earth to the fulfilment of man in the november issue of ramparts magazine james baldwin is quoted in an editorial as saying that he could not accept the proposition that the yearold travail of the american negro should result in the attainment of the present level of american civilization white people cannot in the generality be taken as models of how to live rather the white man is himself in sore need of new standards it would be absurd to challenge this excerpted critique with the contention that baldwin has failed to understand the best values of the establishment the charge most often leveled at social critics it is quite apparent from his work that baldwin understands america only all too wellfar better in fact than do most members of the establishment these same men who disparage his writings would do well to read him closely for the full reality behind baldwins remarks is that the present movement toward accepting the negro into american life is predicated on a maintenance of the traditional white status quo an attitude that implicity assumes its values to be supremely desirable a movement that willin a moment of boundless magnanimityallow the negro to elevate himself to babbitts height if he proves himself worthy enough this attitude is absolutely intolerable it embodies the very essence of white supremacy it must be discarded immediately and a new orientation substituted before it condemns the nation to political and social disaster the arrogance of the wasp establishments selfrighteous condescension in legislating what it has convinced itself is the passionate striving of the negro to be at one with the great white society must be halted at once this belief presumes that its holder has nothing to learn from the negro while the negropoor bedeviled black that he ishas the world to gain by taking communion of the new barbarisms god technos well just whose world will he gain duponts dean rusks the planned though obsolete world of general motors the world of los angeles police chief parker lest the reader think these concerns are solitary ones that they pertain to a few problem areas in the south only and not to northern cities that have no problem let us look at william stringfellows book my people is the enemy his conclusions derive from his years of work in harlem as legal counsel for the poor he found that the political recognition which negroes have so far received has been purchased by the surrender of their identity and integrity as negroes although stringfellow is as much in favor of social change in the urban ghettoes as the next perhaps more he remains by no means persuaded that the standard of social improvement should be that of the great american bourgeoisie americas long history of race war and a biracial culture culminating in the violent emotions of watts should have brought the realization that our course of behavior was neither adequate nor equal to needs one would reasonably assume that having come via watts to sudden national awareness that a very real problem still exists this most pragmatic of nations would now create a mode of reconciliation more realistic more just this has not been the case as slick papers are turned out by professional social workers and cityappointed commissions the reality of violent revolution grows more valid more appealing daily while the most elaborate sophistry is used to justify the selfinterests of local and national power structures and the churches must be included still another summer approaches in its coming heat we may witness a watts in every major city outside the south by the edicts and terms in current usage among the administration one sees there an awareness that a problem exists perversely and predictably it is interpreted as the negro problem rather than as a recent issue of ebony saw it as the white problem of america instead of modifying the environment and content of american life creating a viable culture for all the negro along with his fellow nonwhite will be made over until he suits the economic and governmental intents and purposes he is to serve the national policy to date had been one of massive containment of the negro outside the mainstream of american life this tactic having obviously even embarrassingly failed the strategy has now evolved into one of containment through controlled absorption since we couldnt lick them goes this reasoning let us lure them into the same boat were in moving to the back of course and convince them that our battle is theirs also while i have reservations as to the feasibility of this theory it will probably be accepted by the powersthatbe for it seems to have been worked out on the same computer by the same people who created our china policy nuclear defense notions vietnamese war games anticommunism programs etc it will be used by the empowered until some bright randy young man comes up with a better solution now this is all very fine and good but for this to succeed we must all metamorphisize into creatures whose eyes are able to transform all black into white the negro has never indicated any desire to be made white incidentally may i ask just what is wrong with his blackness we are determined to ramrod a white bill of rights down the negros throat while he is still choking on watts but even as great a task as the resolving of race relations is it is incapable of solution until the central problem of western lifeepitomized in americais successfully confronted we have yet to come to terms with the economic facts of life in a rapidly transitional society a society which has not static stability as its goal but the assimilation of constant flux where individual immersion in change is a way of life and an ability to cope will mark ones status thanks to a hundred years of an imposed cultural lag the negro and tens of millions of other citizens are the victims twiceover of a technology and productive system that penalizes them for the deprivation they have suffered under it it is now claimed that through massive applications of education and relearning programs we can create a citizen who fits into the new society but the intrinsic promise of technology coupled with the rate of development is so rapidly expanding that it is very likely all the crash efforts in the world will not avert huge unemployment to say nothing of further alienation from society such as it is disregarding the what and how of quantity and quality our production systems are running under capacity now while new operations and applied science demands maximum efficiency and output at all levels as private corporations continue to bloat in size and dwindle in number while refusing to regulate the quantity and quality of production or reevaluate its scheme of goals the economy will continue to haphazardly spiral upwards on the charts dependent on the paper tigers of war and waste to maintain high growth rates not molded or educated in the context of an exceedingly complex industrial society the minorities have poured into the cities only to find urban monsters in process of decay as decent living areas tens of millions look on as wealth which they have helped to accrue concentrates and accumulates above them they find they have no voice in the direction or quality of their life yet they live in a nation that will conscript them to die in support of their deprivation youth in anxious rebellion and desperate attempts at selfassertion finding few provisions for creative alternatives turns to drugs violence reactionary conservatism and a hypnotic militarism if these responses are frowned upon what other choices are available in a society that punishes with unbelievable cruelty their efforts at free speech free press free assembly we are just now beginning to pay the price of corporate free enterprise as it is carried out to its selfdefeating ends if the spring is to return to our year then it must be preceeded by a new coordination of national and individual purposes a complete revision of existing laws to be fol lowed by ones that are uniformly regulated and enforced a strict adherence to equality before the law for every person regardless of age and a restoration of participative democracy in an electoral system that has real and meaningful choices not merely an exchanging of administrators within the monolith of bureaucracy perhaps the most amazing aspect of the chaos that is modern american life is the simultaneous existence of agencies and abilities capable of effective reform alongside the most incredible disregard of such opportunities why are they going unheeded the students for a democratic society and the student nonviolent coordinating committee are only two of the agencies for social reform that have risen from the people to meet the peoples needs the growing third party movements the black_panther the freedom democratic party are hopeful elements of correction making their influence felt at the state and local seats of government in the cities especially we have witnessed long overdue corrections come about because of grassroots activism not only are activists and intellectuals available personally by the hundreds but the networks of communications are greater than ever with important variations and differences a deluge of new magazines and journals has brought people everywhere into contact unheard of previously new styles of writing encourage feelings of bondedness even as television confirms the brotherhood of men however distant talented and gifted men are everywhere but in the determining positions of the administration or so their attitudes suggest it is tragically grim to wonder if perhaps a rash of wattses are needed to stir the slumbering washingtonians and america at large in the schools and churches what awareness has trickled down to their participants has been opposed if not eliminated by administration usually for fear of fomenting a revolt from the desks and pews but good god could anything be more fearful than a watts in every city in the land even the ones that have no problem people said voltaire deserve the kind of government they have are we to be historys fools serving only to vindicate voltaires wit the phrases and intonations that one hears are those of consensus and concern for opinion and unanimity words whose contents settle all too easily into complacency smug assurance of right and wrong and finally a cheap fascism of the center we are pursuing a resolution of self cast in such unreal forms that we now stand in grave danger of losing what we most would save our souls not only in the theological sense but in the existential religious meaning also by making available no alternative in the direction or quality of life other than that of mr and mrs babbitt living on new main st in megalopolis usa we are well on the way to culminate in the ultimate consumer culture where a man is the last entry in the biggest bookkeeping operation ever made america to relegate the negro to his proper place as a black cog alongside his fellow white cog in a nationmachine seems to be our national and economic predestination we metaphysic that integrated machines run more efficiently more smoothly more profitably sign seen in business office recently of southern corporation integration pays it is my passionate hope that neither of these cogs comes to pass the warnings of marx dostoyevsky huxley fromm and others have been made and should prove sufficient to right reason and right sentiment to refuse to accept the negros contribution and to refuse to accord him respect for himself is to precipitate disaster i do not believe there is a mystique of negritude or that the negros blackness will magically save us but to eradicate him as if he had never existed which according to most american history texts he never has except for being central to the civil war while bleaching him white will be the last sin of our history does manregardless of his colorhave to become the final unit in a national consuming machine must we push the negro into roles that we are unhappy in ourselves perhaps our misery wishing for company of numbers to alleviate it our national motto should be miseria concordia certainly if anything is to be done to stop this pernicious drift living in an atmosphere of gradualism and detached noninvolvement are not among them wake up dear hearts days of crisis will not be long upon us no matter how we approach it our future nationally and individually is inseparably bound to that of the negro and other minorities the dominant life values of the wasp hive and their attendant social heirarchy must undergo a total reordering we must free ourselves to direct our lives in a sounder healthier manner or we shall persist in the antisocial unloving unkind behavior that has brought chaos into our nation our cities our hearts watts need never happen again if it does it will mean that good men have not been allowed to prevail for the answers we so desperately call for and the means to achieve democratic goals are now with us we have only to make use of them we must engage in a reciprocal relationship with the negro not as negro but as human beings careful to keep that relating alive and quick else we again become as rigid and unrealistic as dead in our hearts and souls as the damnable relationship of our past that there will be profound consequences even unforeseen ones is an ineluctable conclusion what matters most is that we remain positive and open to change change which we must seek to understand not fear though we cannot legislate morality we can create the environment that nurtures and sustains moral relationships to paraphrase the opening sentence of woodwards the strange career of jim crow the people of america should be the last to expect indefinite continuity of their institutions and social arrangements to ignore the negros very real identity and assets is to ignore all humanity to neglect and even betray the heart and vision of what democracy is to mean in america mark twain said effect that when country enslaves people the first necpessary job is to make the world feel that the people to enslaved are subhuman the to make his fellowbe next job is countrymen believe that man is inferior and then the unkindest cut of all is to make that man believe himself inferior a good job has been done on the black people in this country as far as convincing them of their inferiority is concerned the general white community has told us in a million different ways and in no uncertain terms that god and nature made a mistake when it came to the fashioning of us and ours the whole society having been thoroughly convinced of the stained threatening and evil nature of anything unfortunate enough to be or referred to as black as an intended matter of courtesy refers to those of african extraction as colored or negro the fact that negro is the spanish word for black is hardly understood it would seem or it would seem that the word black may be intimated or suggested but never simply stated in good english too many negroes if described or referred to as black take it as an affront and i was once told by a canadian irishman that id insulted him by referring to my person as a black woman he insisted that in actuality i was brown not black and i felt obliged to tell him he described himself as white and that he wasnt white either the fact that white people readily and proudly call themselves white glorify all that is white and whitewash all that is glorified becomes unnatural and bigoted in its intent only when these same whites deny persons of african heritage who are black the natural and inalienable right to readily and proudly call themselves black glorify all that is black and blackwash all that is glorified yet one is forced to conclude that this is not the case at all that an astonishing proportion of the white population finds it discomforting that blacks should dare to feel so much glory in being beautifully black in the face of this kind of reasoning the only conclusion one can logically come to is that there is something wrong with this society and its leadership the mans opinion of god is sorry to put it nicely and his opinion of himself is simply vague and hazy consider swearing his love and devotion to the omnipotent one on the one hand yet defying and cursing him with rank impudence on the other using the crutch of his inherently base and callow nature on the one hand and claiming his godhood on the other worshipping a jew as the son of god on the one hand yet persecuting all other jews as enemies of god on the other historically placing this same jew on the african continent on the one hand and describing him as a european in physical appearance on the other still one would suppose that its tacitly understood by all that god couldnt be anything other than white no matter where he was bom advocating that the black man is made of inferior stuff on the one hand yet defying him not to prove his superiority on the other naming hurricanes for women on the one hand yet h is for the heart as pure as gold on the other giving her pet names such as whore slut bitch etc on the one hand yet put them all together and they spell mother the word that means the world to me on the other no wonder the slogan white is right could take a whole nation by storm one could never accuse this society of being rational still instead of this irrational society warping my delicate little psyche it only drove me ultimately to the conclusion that any black human being able to survive the horrendous and evil circumstances in which one inevitably finds oneself trapped must be some kind of a giant with great and peculiar abilities with an armor as resistant as steel yet made of purest gold my mother is one of the most courageous people i have ever known with an uncanny will to survive when she was a young woman the white folks were much further in the lead than they are now and their racist rules gave her every disadvantage yet she proved herself a queen among women any women and as a result will always be one of the great legends for me but strange as it is ive heard it echoed by too many black full grown males that black woman hood is the downfall of the black man in that she the black woman is evil hard to get along with domineering suspicious and narrowminded in short a black ugly evil you know what as time progresses ive learned that this description of my mothers sisters and partners in crime is used as the basis and excuse for the further shoving by the black man of his own head into the sand of oblivion hence the black mother housewife and allaround girl thursday is called upon to suffer both physically and emotionally every humiliation a woman can suffer and still function her head is more regularly beaten than any other womans and by her own man shes the scapegoat for mr charlie she is forced to stark realism and chided if caught dreaming her aspirations for her and hers are for sanitys sake stunted her physical image has been criminally maligned assaulted and negated shes the first to be called ugly and never yet beautiful and as a consequence is forced to see her man an exact copy of her emotionally and physically brainwashed and wallowing in selfloathing pick for his own the physical antithesis of her the white woman and incubator of his heretofore arch enemy the white man then to add guilt to insult and injury she the black woman stands accused as the emasculator of the only thing she has ever cared for her black man accused by her black man she is the scapegoat for what white america has made of the negro personality raped and denied the right to cry out in her pain she has been named the culprit and called loose hotblooded wanton sultry and amoral she has been used as the white mans sexual outhouse and shamefully encouraged by her own egoless man to persist in this function wanting too to be carried away by her prince charming she must in all honesty admit that he has been robbed of his crown by the very assaulter and assassin who has raped her still she looks upon her man as gods gift to black womanhood and is further diminished and humiliated and outraged when the feeling is not mutual when a white man likes colored girls his woman the white woman is the last one he wants to know about it yet seemingly when a negro likes white girls his woman the black woman is the first he wants to know about it white female rejects and social misfits are flagrantly flaunted in our faces as the ultimate in feminine pulchritude our women are encouraged by our own men to strive to look and act as much like the white female image as possible and only those who approach that goal in physical appearance and social behavior are acceptable at best we are made to feel that we are poor imitations and excuses for white women evil evil you say the black woman is hurt confused frustrated angry resentful frightened and evil who in this hell dares suggest that she should be otherwise these attitudes only point up her perception of the situation and her healthy rejection of same maybe if our women get evil enough and angry enough theyll be moved to some action that will bring our men to their senses there is one unalterable fact that too many of our men cannot seem to face and that is we black evil ugly women are a perfect and accurate reflection of you black evil ugly men play hide and seek as long as you can and will but your every rejection and abandonment of us is only a sorry testament of how thoroughly and carefully you have been blinded and brainwashed and let it further be understood that when we refer to you we mean ultimately us for you are us and vice versa we are the women who were kidnapped and brought to this continent as slaves we are the women who were raped are still being raped and our bastard children snatched from our breasts and scattered to the winds to be lynched castrated deegoed robbed burned and deceived we are the women whose strong and beautiful black bodies were and arestill being used as a cheap labor force for miss annes kitchen and mr charlies bed whose rich black and warm milk nurtured and still nurturesthe heir to the racist and evil slavemaster we are the women who dwell in the hellhole ghettos all over this land we are the women whose bodies are sacrificed as living cadavers to experimental surgery in the white mans hospitals for the sake of white medicine we are the women who are invisible on the television and movie screens on the broadway stage we are the women who are lusted after sneered at leered at hissed at yelled at grabbed at tracked down by white degenerates in our own pitiable poverty stricken and prideless neighborhoods we are the women whose hair is compulsively fried whose skin is bleached whose nose is too big whose mouth is too big and loud whose behind is too big and broad whose feet are too big and flat whose face is too black and shiny and whose suffering and patience is too long and enduring to be believed whos just too damned much for everybody we are the women whose bars and recreation halls are invaded by flagrantly disrespectful bigoted simpering amoral emotionally unstable outcast maladjusted nymphomaniacal condescending white women in desperate and untiring search of the exceedingly outsized black penis that will be attached to the animalistic frothingatthemouthforawhitewoman strongbacked sixtyminute hot black our men we are the women who upon protesting this invasion of our privacy and sanctity and sanity are called jealous and evil and smallminded and prejudiced we are the women whose husbands and fathers and brothers and sons have been plagiarized imitated denied and robbed of the fruits of their genius and who consequently we see emasculated jailed lynched driven mad deprived enraged and made suicidal we are the women who nobody seemingly cares about who are made to feel inadequate stupid and backward and who inevitably have the most colossal inferiority complexes to be found and who is spreading the propaganda that the only free people in this country are the white man and the black woman if this be freedom then heaven is hell right is wrong and cold is hot who will revere the black woman who will keep our neighborhoods safe for black innocent womanhood black womanhood is outraged and humiliated black womanhood cries for dignity and restitution and salvation black womanhood wants and needs protection and keeping and holding who will assuage her indignation who will keep her precious and pure who will glorify and proclaim her beautiful image to whom will she cry rape the racist leaves us no doubt he is the enemy he hides behind no beautiful words of welcome while holding the door shut with his toe should we choose to physically fight governor wallace would give us no doubt as to who should be struck with the weapon he is my enemy the enemy of my children and friends and i respect his candor he keeps us awake and alert my introduction to hypocrisy and prejudice came simultaneously my father took my brothers and i each day to the catholic school in town this was before the prestige of suburban living we were farmers we were poor perhaps this is why i was drawn to another classmate who was different although i didnt think about it then i only knew that i liked her and that she liked me she didnt poke fun when the others teased me because i obviously owned only two dresses we sheltered each other when a section of the class hooted as we stated firmly that there was too a santa claus catholic universal allinclusive having broad sympathies or understanding liberal first grade in a catholic school in a kansas town we learned that god loves everyone we worship god by acts of faith hope and charity thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself man is a creature composed of body and soul and made to the image and likeness of god sister didnt mention that we loved our neighbor only if he looked just like we did we were told that charity was in part being kind to others our church had numbers on the pews a number for each family one sunday i spied my friend already seated in the pew with her family i genuflected as all good catholics do and sat with christine eight years old and we learned that we should have read between the lines our teacher a nun the principal a nun and the parish priest brought me to the office the next morning christine wasnt there but they explained to me that nice little girls did not sit with the negroes the negroes have their own pews with numbers all in the back of this catholic church all grouped together dont you want the other children to like you little girl i hated them they made me feel dirty they made me feel guilty i cried christine had never made me feel guilty even when we sometimes fought she had never made me feel dirty as we walked around the school yard with our arms about each others waists as little girls do the first lesson we were friends in the school yard and grew closer when my family later moved to town but we never again sat together in church in kansas integrated the schools it was no longer necessary for the negro children to walk many blocks passing one or two public schools to get to their own separate but equal school but the catholic parish had shown its benevolence many years before it had christine by the time we reached high school my associations had pretty well ostracized me from the white cliques but the catholic high school had made great strides here we had three negroes boys football stars we were not brave we never discussed the quirk of fate that found the four of us sharing one disguised box lunch i brought to the football banquet each year we pretended not to notice that the other girls shared theirs with only one boy a different boy each time after all the boxes were disguised no one but the nun in charge knew who was going to draw which box educate to give knowledge or training instruct to form and develop ones taste etc senior year was spent in the public school there were many more negro young people here and we talked more freely to the faculty they were very kind and understanding their indulgence in explaining that we could not use the swimming pool because it was simply too expensive to drain it every other day was above reproach there was not even a problem in electing the king and queen for the promtwo sets one negro one caucasian the instruction was as excellent in the public school as it had been in the catholic school although in retrospect notable for what we did not learn rather than for what we did learn in studying african and negro history as an adult i reproached myself many times for not having paid attention in class thereby having to wait years before realizing the beauty and pride of the great americans of african heritage until my own children were in school attention had nothing to do with it we lived several years in a white neighborhood where my children were never in a class larger than i taught them the history of the american negro that they were not receiving in school as well as the history being made with sitins bus rides and the like they are now being educated in an allnegro school with from to to a class and i no longer have to worry about the lack of history last month they studied africa they learned that the people there get drunk all the time in discussing what they had learned they thought that perhaps the men who loaded the banana boats drank a barrel of wine each night because they were frightened of the tarantulas they were far more interested however in their new knowledge of the animals cannibals no one could have asked for a finer and more intricate description of how a person is cut open and his heart attached to a stick to be burned before he is eaten perhaps they were taught other things but they and some of the other children who talked to me about this privileged course cant remember past the fascinating life of the cannibal perhaps the denver school administration will set up another council to study it llie school board is grand about setting up councils to study the problems of the negro community they dont seem to have a problem saying yes or no mostly yes to the white community but with us they set up councils education is not much of a problem however we now have remedial training courses this enables a young person once he has gone through years of overcrowded schools fantastically rapid teacher turnover antiquated books and such to go back and learn what he could have learned from the beginning given half a chance by the administration without the help of the councils committee a group of people chosen to consider some matter or function councils and committees what would the man do if it werent for the committee he would have to do of course therefore the committee several months ago members of civil_rights groups and social problem organizations went to the mayor to discuss the mounting complaint of police brutality but said the mayor we already have the internal affairs bureau investigation of police by police and the mayors committee on citycitizens relations nonpaid committee appointed by the mayor to investigate complaints after much discussion it was decided that perhaps a committee was the answer hence the community relations bureau three police officers spend a great deal of time going to school explaining what nice people policemen are and what overwhelming problems they face the iab continues to find accusations ridiculous the mcccr continues to ignore charges the crb continues their public relations drive we still hear the complaints of police brutality but what the hell could we have another committee study about policemen employ to make use of use to provide work and pay for thats just about it they make use of use and sometimes provide work but pay for thats not quite right my caustic tongue leaps ahead of real constructive thinking negroes and spanishsurnamed people gain fine jobs the federal center post office city and state commissions councils and committees each time the masses grumble some nice minority person is given another position lets hope that the government never executes a wholesale dismissal or the walls of this ghetto will swell back to bursting poverty the condition or quality of being poor indigence need there is a war on it boards are set up for it people are hired to fight it they are paid huge salaries to combat it the boards and staffs are so busy talking about what they are going to do about it that they cant find it boards must have one third of the membership comprised of the poor boards establishing poverty programs are composed of kind sensitive concerned people so they sometimes set up two boards one for the powerful and one for the indigent this saves the poor from having to worry about hiring staff business and all the appalling things the poor shouldnt have to worry about on top of being poor never mind that the war on poverty was designed to build leaders and selfdirection in the indigent communities they are too busy being poor to have the time confusing well so is the war on poverty rehabilitation in sociology to restore a dependent defective or criminal to a state of physical mental and moral health through treatment and training years ago the united states had a system of revenge in the penitentiary penancepenitentiary modern day penology no longer believes in revenge we train men and women living in penal institutions we train them to load cans of beans on shelves pick beets maintain silence or we put them on the waiting list of the more enlightening programs perhaps this is just as well the frustration of the untrained man will be less than the trained individual when he discovers that society will not allow him to complete his sentence and obtain employment no matter how learned and skilled he might be young people are no problem at all the consensus seeming to be that the graduated steps from juvenile hall to buena vista to colorado state prison are better than what he would have at home anyway once he gets to csp he can then go through the abovementioned training routine and be saved or he can gain the status of a returnee which puts him into another category and i think theres a committee to study the returnee problem news recent happenings especially those broadcast over the radio printed in a newspaper etc reports of such events living in the north one hears a vast amount of criticism concerning the atrocities of the south newspapers print the findings of committees in washington that study the problems of minorities a lot is heard about the stability of integrated park hill they even have tours of the beautiful homes there inhabited by doctors lawyers judges teachers etc we hear about other minorities in denver in crime reports other cities should educate employ house and learn from the lessons taught in farreaching areas seemingly then we have no troubles in denver this entire paragraph was wasted time excuse me lead to show the way to or direct the course of by going before or along with one would think from this definition that of necessity a leader would need something to lead our leaders dont seem to be bothered with this encumbrance the going before seems to please most of them its the along with that brings on the glassyeyed stare leaders have a conscience though surveys can do wonders for a conscience with leaders surveys take precedence over committees civil_rights in law relating to the private rights of individuals and to legal actions involving these in mrse rosa parks gave us the courage to begin a new era of revolt at least one publicized as revolt rather than riot the backlash of boycotts and freedom rides in southern communities moved some to demonstrations in the north core naacp and sncc demonstrated in denver demanding a fair housing law equal employment and so on even the most biased looked upon the negro with new respect although they claimed that this riotous behavior was pushy perhaps it was necessary for separate but equal equality we made strides and then relaxed civil_rights organizations certainly dont form councils or committees they abhor them they dont do anything about them but they abhor them oh yes they do do something they draw up philosophy and guidelines they worry a lot about riots and a great deal of time is spent talking about those people hours are spent talking about how to reach them it is amazing that they are so apathetic that they never show up at meetings set up for them in some isolated from them sterile section of the city devil something evil or bad a wicked person white devils elijah muhammad calls us and by the time his word began to be heard over the country i quite agreed most of my life has been spent in anger and resentment toward the hypocrisy of the large majority of my race times in a white community had never been comfortable i wanted my children to grow up free from the influence of the white devil so when they began to resent friends who came to visit because of the name chanting of the neighborhood young people we moved to the allnegro area where we have stayed after an initial period as paddies there was a blending that i do not feel could have been accomplished had the situation been reversed for the caucasian is taught to hate almost as he begins to breathe the look and nudge passed between parents as they notice a mixed couple eenie meenie minie moe if you

black sheep niggerlover give em an inch rationalize to devise superficially rational or plausible explanations or excuses for ones acts beliefs desires usually without being aware that these are not the real motives but the time has passed when i can blame mr charlie alone for the hypocrisy of human rights it is a warning my lips and heart want to violently scream as i see the negro leader who leaves his people behind in the ghetto the leader who rises up once in every meeting denounces the white man and then sits quietly until the next meeting the man who speaks eloquently but never has time for work when a nice negro is accepted into a window dressing position when civil_rights groups listen attentively to the platitudes of the white liberal who tells them they must go slow that things are better dont rock the boat the liberal who when not in the hearing of his negro friend is not quite so liberal the liberator who drags his feet as he reaches the gate the freedom lover who desires integration but not in his block the white man who is shocked as he hears discussions of violencevsnonviolence by the frustrated negro if our children are to be able to live with some semblance of harmony in the future we must face and fight these hypocrisies or we the masses will suffocate in the degradation of poverty tumult and need as we watch mr charlie and uncle tom walk hand

barricades bootstraps what youre pulling yourself up by while theyre kicking you in the there two categoj a jpa ries of individuals in ii the united states who are upset enous h at the present progress of the civil_rights revolution to call their supporters to arms the first type is the frightened fringetype white conservatives who fear their american way of life is threatened these people are arming to protect what they call their constitutional rights the second group is civil_rights workers who are arming to protect themselves from physical attacks by people usually of the first group for the first group any gain in civil_rights is too much for the second group present gains are not enough the issues on both sides center around the progress of the civil_rights movement this article will deal with considerations posed by the arming of civil_rights workers the basic strategy of whose movement has been nonviolence any examination of its progress or problems has to deal first with the basic tactic of nonviolence as a vehicle for social political and cultural revolution there are certain basics which must be taken into consideration at the outset first negroes constitute approximately per cent of the nations population second the rights that negroes seek were guaranteed them by the working of the democratic process further it was almost years after the american constitution and declaration of independence before the words set down in those two documents were considered to apply to black men these facts indicate just one thing whether we like it or not negroes are existing in the united states with these guarantees such as they are at sufferance of the white majority negroes have been in america for more than years we did the manual labor necessary for the economic growth of the country we provided the white world with the leisure time to educate itself and to progress along the paths of civilization we fought in the wars of defense of the country we gave this country its only indigenous culture and art form by any standard one would care to establish we belong here but belonging and getting what is rightfully ours are two different things to achieve the latter to fully possess our birthright we must of necessity adopt a minority underdog tactic there are just two proven tactics befitting our circumstances one is guerilla warfare the other is passive resistance nonviolence any other form of overt resistance in the face of superior numbers and resistance capacity is sheer folly ornonsense guerilla warfare is based upon several basic principles first the majority of the population must be in sympathy with the new cause because guerillas must live off the land and their hitandrun tactics are dependent upon the support of others second the confrontation with the enemy must take place at sites where the insurgents have a superior knowledge of the terrain while the opposition is ignorant of or illsuited to the surroundings third terrorism becomes an essential element of the struggle both friend and enemy must be afraid of the consequences of being set upon by the insurgent group the fact that the civil_rights movement in the united states is fatally short of the elements of guerilla warfare is so apparent as to make further consideration of this form of resistance pointless nonviolence has a long and a successful history of overcoming formidable odds in the interests of progress in ancient times perhaps the most dramatic example was the christian struggle for tolerance acceptance and dominance the christian idea was an unpopular one going to the very roots of what the majority rigidly held as sacred here is a persuasive example of a hated and feared underdog who ultimately conquered the one single factor characterizing this development was the nonviolent nature of the christians purges sadistic indignities and horrifying deaths did not alter their selected course and their strategem of passive resistance as a result of this experience it became well documented that an idea cannot be suppressed or killed with violence conversely it demonstrates that an idea cannot be furthered by force either people supplant one idea only with one they believe to be better even more pertinent is the fact that an idea cannot be protected by violence if this were the case then the lynchings killings and other crimes of southern whites would have wiped out the idea of freedom for the black man in the south thus maintaining the notion of white supremacy forever we know that this is certainly not the case there are those who believe in the cylical theory of historyhistory repeats itself whether this is a valid historical hypothesis or not one has to be impressed with the parallels between ancient rome and the united states today rome had reached a very high degree of civilization when christianity became a serious issue first there were frantic efforts at suppression of the new ideology when the atrocities and fanaticism failed to change the dedication and faith of the christians the pagan romans became impressed with the dignity and inner superiority of these new turn the other cheek christians and many were convinced that any religion which provided its followers with this type of conviction and courage had to be superior they then made this better idea their own just as the pagans of rome bowed to the superiority of a new idea so the civil_rights leaders have the same challenge offered them to demonstrate the intrinsic and innate merit of their ideas this cannot be done by looking down the barrel of a gun whether it is in defense or not because the person at the other end is not going to be impressed with anything other than the fact that he wishes he were some place else those in the movement who are advocating arms to make the distinction between defensive violence and offensive violence are in for trouble this is about as easy as trying to separate an uncle tom from a good nigger it just depends on your point of view further as rev martin_luther_king jr points out perhaps offensive and defensive violence has meaning for intellectuals but for the rest of us the line of demarcation rapidly and easily disappears in any emotional hostile confrontation perhaps one of the most succinct statements on the whole issue of black_power andor violence by a civil rightist was made by dick gregory in jackson mississippi at the conclusion of the meredith march he said to the large audience there you know what remember those atomic bombs we dropped by mistake in spain well i wish they would drop one right down here in mississippi laughter no really right here pause anlet us find it then baby we would have black_power laughter its a funny thing but the way you say black_power down here sounds like black_power to me and that scares hell out of me laughter but anyway we find this here atomic bomb an you know what we do with it then we take it right over to governor johnsons mommas house gales of laughter she looks out of the window and starts to sing you have overcome then we takes it to the white house and say to lbj hey baby we got us some black_power now and well trade it for some civil_rights laughter what gregory was obviously and truthfully getting at was the fact that unless there is an overwhelming amount of potential violence we cannot expect to gain any lasting respect or change through the use of direct violence one of the very strange paradoxes of the civil_rights leaders wanting to arm and there are several is the fact that it flies in the face of everything progressive or forward looking violence on a world scale has been effectively eliminated as a method of settling disputes furthering ideals or protecting ideas certainly there are koreas cubas viet nams and there will be others but these are local and isolated and although the threat of involvement by two large nations directly confronting each other is apparent it is highly unlikely that such an event will materialize the point is that war on a world scale has been informally diminished as a means of settling world crisis as this becomes more and more the case then the case for settlement by negotiation becomes stronger but settlement by negotiation presupposes some sort of forum debate such as the un this in turn means representative bodies at work because of the composition of the worlds peoples the majority of nations are nations of color this fact and the need of support from these countries at conferences and meetings has been one of the principal reasons for a more active role by the u s government in civil_rights our representatives were subjected to ridicule and scorn before these august bodies when they spoke of selfdetermination peoples independence democracy and other platitudes in the cold war as it is constituted now the u s simply could not afford to tolerate the senseless and undemocratic denial of negro rights this became our lever the pictures of defenseless innocent people simply petitioning for their rights and being set upon with dogs clubs and water hose were the fulcrum of the lifting up of negro rights before the world make no mistakethe essential element was the fact that these people were without question free of evil or sinister motives it was without doubt the fact that they were acting in good faith and good will introduce the element of arms be they for defense or offense and a diminution and dilution of the image takes place to advocate arming is to preach directly against the dictates of the lessons of history and contemporary common sense in a word it is nonsense we cannot however depend upon the governments concern for world opinion to continue to carry the bulk of civil_rights progress we have had government charity before it was just a years ago when negroes were feeling the first flush of freedom as the result of the norths suppression of the souths campaign to secede just as northern punishment of the south then was based more on vindictiveness than on moral commitment so when the time was expedient for the government to forget its charity it did so and the negro was suppressed more fiercely than before history has demonstrated that we cannot expect any sustained windfalls we must press on and convince the white united states that complete civil_rights is the only acceptable posture for the negro further we must illustrate to the power structure black and white that the alternative to progressive civil_rights is something totally unacceptable to them in other words it must be positively manifested to the respective power structures that it is in their best interest to continue to press for complete and full civil_rights if we are going to depend principally upon indigenous domestic pressures to maintain the civil_rights momentum then it becomes imperative that we have certain negroes who are capable and dedicated by circumstance of maintaining the pressure in a very real sense we have a need for neonecessary negroes the traditional necessary negro was the one who sat by the door as you came into an otherwisewhite office he was the especially invited black at select social gatherings just as the white power structure needs necessary negroes so does the black_power structure need neonecessary negroes to explain further let us repeat the well established point that power has the tendency to do two things first it corrupts second it makes its possessor conservative the neonecessary negro keeps pressure on the black_power structure to keep pressure on the white power structure an example of this in operation is the fact that the one black man most responsible for the successes of rev martin_luther_king jr was malcolm_x malcolm_x did two things to and for dr_king he kept king honest in a word he kept him on his toes second malcolm_x astonished frightened and coerced a number of powerful white and black people into supporting king as the lesser of two evils these people saw in king an acceptable alternative to the kind of philosophy malcolm_x was advocating the result was that kings position and prestige were enhanced immeasurably no amount of black money could have bought this kind of support it was only through the fear generated by malcolm_x the original neonecessary negro that dr_king was able to insure for himself acceptance by the national and international power structures as leader of the civil_rights movement with malcolm_x gone and the civil_rights movement even more in need of neonecessary negroes than before we have a new breed of militant negroes coming forth with frightening way out ideas the rallying cry for this new breed is black_power like most new slogans and oversimplifications black_power has almost as many different meanings as there are people who care to define it there are certain notions common to most responsible definitions though usually there is an emphasis on the negros effective utilization of his political potential in addition there is usually a call for negroes to support black business and in general to think in terms of separation to the emerging militant leaders who depend on militancy as their sustaining virtue and who must come up with more sensational radical doctrines the term black_power very literally means black fire power its a common occurrence that neophytes must be more of whats popular in order to get their foot in the door and compete with the incumbents the civil_rights movement is no different the new breed must come up with more excitingsounding slogans in order to gain a following and push the older mellowing leaders aside that the neonecessary negroes play an important function in the long range success of civil_rights is not disputed here what is at issue is the fact that the more militant violenceoriented leaders are advocating policies which are historically strategically and logistically unfeasible and absolute nonsense that these men as long as they are a definite minority are essential to the progress of the nonviolent tactic for civil_rights is readily admitted the civil_rights movement is going toward the gray areas the fact that the federal government is nominally supporting civil_rights the fact that the president actively calls for an end to discrimination and the fact that each new legislative session brings new and better laws on the subject all point to one thing the opposition to civil_rights posing the most formidable challenge is the subtle elusive form which lies ahead no longer will there be an exact and well defined delineation but vivid lines of demarcation will give way to amorphous boundaries of gray a little more than years ago the united states undertook to defeat the gray of america and was successful if the nonviolent and the neonecessary negroes continue to unwillingly supplement and complement each other we can do it again perhaps there is something to the cyclical theory of history after all his name was colored boyr and he lived in the slums in the very heart of a huge black ghetto his wife was the negro cook and his children were simply known as those people and like his father before him and his father before that and n indeed as all of his forefathers who had ever walked in this hostile land h had no rights he was reminded of this fact daily as he watched his wife wearily making her way to the affluent suburbs where she toiled for coolie wages and he was vividly aware of this fact as he himself made his way to yet another suburb where he slaved for wages similar to those paid his wife and he knew this beyond a shadow of a doubt when he saw his children returning home day after day year after year from their ancient dilapidated school with no books no homework and no hope he was the handyman in a huge gleaming ultramodern supermarket which never ceased to amaze him everything worked there the food carts moved with only the slightest touch there were none of those rusty threewheeled numbers which abounded in his neighborhood and there were always plenty of cashiers who smiled and who indeed acted as if they truly believed the customer was always right but the most incredible phenomena of all were the products which were not only of the finest quality but were so beautiful to look at until he often felt it was almost a sin to take money for working in such a showplace of beauty the meats were a succulent vibrant red and the fruits and vegetables were so fresh looking until he was certain they grew right there in their bins and there were never any bent cans on the shelves or busted packages which seemed to form the very foundation of the markets in his forlorn neighborhood of course hed worked on the job several years now and he knew what happened when the meats grew tired and the vegetables drooped and the fruits turned brown from overripeness some of it was given to him here boy you take this home if you want and he wanted taking it home in two used slightly soiled shopping bags which he kept handy for such occasions but most of the used and abused goods were loaded onto a huge truck in the hush of night and shipped out to other neighborhoods where the stores did not gleam and the cashiers snarled and worked terribly slow and acted as if they believed the motley illclad customers were intruders and the most amazing part of all however was what happened to the prices apparently as meats grew older their value increased for those tired steaks in his district were always at least ten cents higher than they were when they sparkled in that gleaming store in that golden suburb he had not been born here in this city of concrete and noise dirt and heat toil and loneliness he had come from down yonder seeking a better different life than that of his father who had only endured with the aid of the pint bottle for ever lodged in the hip pocket of his worn overalls he had come here a young man filled with hope and great expectations thinking he had at last found a new land that wanted him as much as he wanted to belong but somehow that very same day of his arrival those men in blue had spied his jaunty step had sensed his hopeful spirit and had backed him up against a wall searching his pockets poking his ribs and reminding him once and for all that he had not gone anywhere at all down yonder was all over wherever he went and he must learn to live with that fact if he wanted to live at all and so quietly inch by inch day by day he finally died before his marriage he had not minded too much the haunting image of death that followed him night and day he had learned to live with it as man has always learned to live with whatever hells he finds surrounding him but when he met another as vulnerable as once he had been he yearned to warn and protect her from the inevitable tortures that lay ahead and his situation became intolerable and he began wearing the pint bottle in his hip pocket in the manner of his father and his fathers father then they were married and the children came and he became the handyman and his wife became the cook and they watched their two children destined for nowhere as such children are always fated to end and once again the process of dying became his daily bread his wife had hope still and a sense of humor at times and always she tried to stand her ground against adversity which came in many ways in many shapes and in many colors whenever they happened to trade at their dingy overcrowded market for staples which were often misshappen or otherwise flawed and were always at least five cents higher than those in his golden supermarket his wife never let anyone slip ahead of them no matter how small the number of packages they held she merely shook her head and winked slightly line baby she would then add nodding toward the rear their children when very small had been his one remaining source of joy and his little girl now only nine still adored him but his son had just turned and had learned the score and now no longer met his fathers eyes you have this camera and this here transitor he would accuse feeling the quality of the items as only a man who owns cheap goods can feel the fineness in that which is not cheap you got em from th boy down th street where did he get em and the silence and then the shrug but never the meeting of the eye as the eyes of father and son should meet take them back the mother would command and then she would proceed to stare her son down while his father walked away to his room to squint nervously at the remains of his pint bottle and an ineffable sadness would settle over him for he knew that one day his daughter too would learn the score and would no longer rush to greet him in the evening when he came through the door and it became a nightmare that followed him to work now and made him want to do strange things as he did the day he saw the blonde woman with her two blonde children rosy wellfed and welldressed and running their cart over him as they always did but this day he grabbed the cart and was about to ram it into those three sparkling people when someone called to him and brought him back to earth he turned in time to see one of the boys he worked with only they were really boys eighteen or nineteen but nobody called them boys they had names and white faces come on the boy urged we need th mop somebody spilled something and he took his mop and went to clean up the mess as he was told to do then there came the time just before he was about to leave early on his halfday off with his two soiled shopping bags laden with flawed goods when he saw the lady in line her soft white hand clutching a wad of green bills not fives or tens but twenties and fifties and even a couple of hundreds and he stood mesmerized his eyes glued to the bills then suddenly he felt himself reaching out to clutch the hand when the floor manager bumped into him and snapped sharply take your broom and git the hell out the way boy and he took his mop and bucket and got the hell out the way as he was told to do and soon he made his weary way back to his prison where the gray invisible walls rose up to meet him as he came out of the subway his two shopping bags weighing him down like the eternal burden that he carried on his back his black skin and his haunted heritage in a land which banished him to an everlasting terror which people often called the ghetto but today a different feeling seemed to pervade the place true the air as usual hung hot and humid laced with the odors of worn out men and women and their innumerable discards which no longer were even capable of delighting the rats then he was made aware of an unnatural silence which banged against his head like an overthrown baseball and he came to a dead standstill wondering for a moment if he had somehow wandered into a strange part of town but then as he stood there peering about in that uncertain fashion which had long been his habit now the silence was shattered as a group of children saw his burdened figure and started running toward him shouting his name which almost no one bothered to use any more then they were upon him all talking at once each eager to be the one who got his story across first it was a total jumble for a moment but then two words leaped out and grabbed him his son was shot why why he clutched a squirming child who who the men in blue he was running running running but children were always running yes but not his children they should walk crawl and be searched standing against the brick wall their ribs poked by a sinister stick their laughter stilled upon their youthful lips where where is he the hospital hours ago with a man in blue standing at the door turning everyone away even the local minister and a white priest were not allowed to enter the hospital is blocks away and his shoes are worn and his feet are ruined but he rushes there neither his feet nor his shopping bags burdening him down any longer down the long silent corridor so like the somber areas in all his nightmares past all the battered doors hiding their suffering inhabitants enfolding them in their halfworld of pain and sorrow he made his way numb with four centuries of agony waiting to overwhelm him the door is open the man in blue is gone and so is his songone where and silence greets him but does not touch him for his numbness is total there is nothing left now he turns and leaves by a side door still carrying his soiled shopping bags which have now become a part of his body flawed and irrelevant he moves on down the street but the children finally see him and rush to surround him with endless questions however he does not hear them nor does he see them he merely walks down the street in his shabby shoes and limp gray shirt and tattered blue trousers and he walks and walks and the children following him increase in number and grow larger in size and finally men and women are following him also and it becomes a parade as still more people join from block to block and someone starts singing and soon they are all singing all except him who leads the way and no longer sees or hears and on and on they move until hes finally confronted with the men in blue who call to him in their usual way hey boy what you got in them bags come here let us see and once again he does as he was told to do he lets them see but suddenly his mauled fist streaks through the air meeting the big red chin of the man in blue then all at once the air is filled with mauled fists as the men women and children who now surround him follow his action and the singing grows louder and the mauled fists fill the air and bedlam is everywhere now he begins to sing as feeling comes back to him again and he strikes and strikes and strikes he regains consciousness several days later wrapped like a mummy in a hospital room his body filled with pain and he hears his affluent countrymen calling him savage and irresponsible but there is hope in heart for now no one was calling him boy a couturier in manhattan has adapted the african look to high fashions and is dressing such stylesetters as baby jane holzer in eyecatching little numbers which might seem comme it faut on the streets of dakar or lagos and over in chicago a pair of deepbrown lassies have opened a boutique called appropriately enough the african look well it isnt the new rage just yet the ebony fashion fair for instance hasnt gotten around to noticing that ladies of african descent have a natural flair for the flowing robes and brilliant colors but there is hope a couple of the european designers are hungup on the elegant feminine version of the boubou and where the great couturiers go the fashion fair cannot be far behind sooner or later even the society femmes de couleur are bound to discover how graceful and yes seductive a sarilike robe can be trailing across a salon or a ballroom floor meanwhile the movement among the men seems to be pretty well established and as is clearly evident on these pages with engaging results if the african look does catch on here then the afroamericans might succeed in reselling it to some of the africans back in its july issue time magazine published maliciously one suspects a photo of a lineup of congolese officials receiving medals from their president in all that heat the good gentlemen

release the shadow of your smile excepting the title song with its nauseating arrangement the album is filled with the immaculate phrasing marvelous breath control and the fantastic rangefrom near

handled really well but others are absolutely fabulous his rendition of the haunting yesterday leaves one involved in the songs drama and his craftsmanship is remarkable on the exciting somethings coming from west side story on a clear day you can see forever is tailormade for the romantic style of mathis and one shares with him a certain joy on a fun song called come back to me which finds mathis unusually ethnic and inspires the listener to rise and do what the spirits says do as usual there is a number included which affords mathis the chance to journey beyond the beyond he comments that in a song he looks for that intangible value that distinguishes something as being out of the ordinary a taste of honey remember morgana is such a song and mathis is such a singerdlin a very real sense the new wave in jazz impulse is a microcosm of jazz history simultaneously recalling the idioms turbulent past and opening doors to what may be the dominant theme in jazzs future for the next several decades many followers will easily recall the transition period of the forties when a group of young experimenters named john birks dizzy gillespie theolonius monk charles yardbird parker max roach and charles mingus and maybe a few others were toying with a brand new kind of jazz improvisation they called bop after a period of heated controversy about the merits of the new music bop and the other forms it influenced became a respectable and accepted school of learning for jazzmen now comes a set of latterday experimenterstenor men john coltrane archie shepp albert ayler altoists marion brown james spaulding trumpeters ashley fennell donald ayler and charles tolliver drummers billy higgins bill harris and roger blank and otherswho are introducing another radical step in jazz improvisation the album contains five numbers recorded at the village in new york city for the benefit of the black arts repertory theatre in harlem at that time headed by leroi jones this thrill and mystify new black music as jones calls it is completely free of any distinguishable at least to the layman listener melody and almost totally departs from all previous musical forms it combines a strange maybe exotic many times exasperating set of whaling squeaky droning and pounding sounds which leave most of us confused groping for something identifiable according to what we have been taught as western music therein lies our error this is not western music this is black music all of these musicians would probably welcome the label black nationalist not because each of them is ready to take to the streets and put the torch to all of western civilization but because they are swept up in the current racial upheaval that finds the black man searching for an identity that is not western but african jones explains you hear on this record poets of the black nation albert ayler in his liner notes tells us the creators of the new music have reached deep into their psyches deep into their cultural origins to find a language of sound that conveys this sense of the world as feeling as knowledge found through the logic of the emotions and truly its the emotions and not the logic of sound that is at work here coltrane together with drummer elvin jones bassist jimmy garrison and pianist mccoy tyner will you on nature mathis boy the ayler brothers on holy ghost trombonist grachan moncur on blue free shepp co on hambone and tolliver and spaulding on brilliant corners will leave you with either a sense of bewilderment as to what they are trying to say or with an esthetic attachment that has deep roots in the black mans determined drive to shed every vestige of the white mans cultural influencefrancis ward naomi long madgetts third book of poems star by star harlo press shows a progression in technique and a widening in themes reviewing her previous book one and the many saunders redding called her a natural poet she has a remarkably keen ear and not only uses the traditional forms with grace but invents new forms and uses the difficult though apparently easy free verse with skill redding was probably referring to her metrical ease as shown in quest which reprinted with a number of other poems from her previous volume has the haunting melodic quality of verlaineanother outstanding reprint is midway which has been widely quoted and misquoted the long lines have the swinging rhythm of a march with its concrete images and biblical vocabulary familiar to everyone who has heard an oldtime preacher it may one day be set to music and used as a secular hymn ive come this far to freedom hese words crescendo to a climax of sound and not by the forced devices of italics or of all capital letters but by the syntax the rhythm the meaning and the gradual shift of vowels across the gamut from the short i of whispered to the broad a of walk the longest and most complex section of the book is trinity a dream sequence a love poem in nineteen sections although uneven it is rewarding in its allusiveness there are echoes not unpleasant of emily dickinson in destiny and star journey and of frost in woman with flower but for all her metrical skill her phrasing is weak the book has shopworn images and vague poetic terms like dreams one reflects on how emily dickinson would write twelve or fifteen synonyms on her manuscript in a search for the precise nuance and how dylan mrs culver explains in her preface that poems about black heroes are needed to give black children a favorable selfimage and to acquaint white children with the accomplishments of black people the range of heroes in this book extends from crispus attucks the revolutionary war martyr to the freedom riders and james meredith the book closes with a poem called my brotherion coupled with the forced interest that the civil_rights movement carries have turned out literal mountains of materials about the race question in this constant parade of material one can find all types and tones but one of the most gratifying kinds of works is that by legitimate scholars often these books are dry with facts almost always they are the products of reasoned thinking based upon extensive research the very good ones are the result of excellent minds skilled in research techniques that can set the findings down in interesting and readable style arthur waskows from race riot to sitindoubleday co is an excellent example of this last category arthur waskow in addition to bringing skills intelligence and interest to the subject matter carries with him something of an overview he is a man of broad interests and his previous books carried the titles the limits of defense and the worried mans guide to world peace waskow could be called an internationalist if we were looking for easy titles but more accurately he is a very bright man who is concerned with the problems that confront us race is one of those problems and one of the phenomena of race in america is the evolution of tactics and manifestations of unrest mr waskow has done a professional and thorough job of tracing this development from to the s with all the fuss going on these days about whether things negroid should be so labeled one would think langston hughes is in danger of being called a racial separatist for editing the book of negro humor dodd mead co thats what it isnegro humor not a foolish mixture of chinese jokes or irish ditties or eskimo party breakers to vindicate the sanctity of the american melting pot this page collection of jokes funny poems and stories downhome tales humorous remembrances and pure sidesplitting comedy come from every segment of negro life it is us baby from the black preacher on sunday in the pulpit to the harlem card shyster from unheralded unknowns like effie lee newsome and robert a johnson to renowned spokesmen for the brother like hughes himself james weldon johnson and martin_luther_king jr come many precious and memorable morsels of good humor and fun thats one of the good things about this book hughes sort of a selftaught specialist on the life and times of black men from his native missouri to harlem realizes that to capture the gaiety and wholesome spontaneity of negro humor he had to go to the sourceto dozens of black men and women themselves plain people who at some juncture in their ives had something funny to say not that hughes does not draw freely from the masters paul laurence dunbar johnson zora neal hurston godfrey cambridge arna bontemps as well as his own writings a witty line thorny subtlety or tickling poem or tale from one or all of them crops up constantly through out the book however its great strength lies in hughes ability to comprehensively reflect the everyday happenings of black existence in the melting pot by drawing on the recollections of so many people from so many walks of life also of worth is the editors ability to draw togetherunder general headings like cool comics or jokes and jivesome of the best from oldtimers like jazzmen w c handy jelly roll morton comedians pigmeat markham and mantan moreland and to fuse them with clarity and consistency with the offerings of more recent writers or folklorists such as leroi jones james baldwin roi ottley john o killens and dan burley as one would naturally expect since it has been the central fact of the black mans life for nearly years in america the race issue is treated by numerous contributors with different messages and varying degrees of wit bitterness and folksiness seldom if ever does anybody wear off into the wilds of unrestrained racialism on the other hand whitey doesnt get off without being reminded of his injustices hughes cambridge dick gregory ottley and other lesser names make sure of that besides having the supremely beneficial effect of entertaining readers by making them laughat themselves and the world outsidethis fine collection of writings has one other salutary plus to its credit it allows negroes to laugh at their frailties and foibles without the spectre of thinking they are supporting societys stereotype of the nonthinking grinning headscratcher some of the stereotypes are taken out of character laughed at then forgotten about without any notice of a supposed larger meaning even ancient movie performer it would be misleading to say actor mantan moreland is allowed a brief space in hughes democracy of comedy and witticisms without the slightest hint of morelands white teeth big eyes and round sweaty black face attributes which did more than a lions share in the s and s to perpetuate the white mans myth about the small size of the negros brain francis ward southerner lippincott by congressman charles longstreet weltner is the honest revelation of a southerner by birth northern in education and right on the masondixon line as far as civil_rights and social relationships are concerned it could just as aptly have been entitled anatomy of advance because congressman weltner does represent an advance over his congressional predecessors from atlanta georgia it perhaps would have been a more apt title because his views are certainly not those of the general white south and anything in the present title to suggest that the contents do reflect the general opinions of the white southerner is misleading congressman weltner manifests many of the traits possessed by a few intelligent and ambitious men of the new south these men are able to see the turn of the tide of social and political forces they can count they can add and they can analyze these are realists pragmatists and moderates these capacities all tend to demonstrate to them that the south will no longer be able to function politically unless the negro is considered as a factor of vital and integral importance this is not to suggest that men like congressman weltner are becoming liberal it is not to infer that they are irrevocably dedicated to openmindedness on the race issue it is only to state that they are willing to do the right thing so long as it is practical feasible and fairly safe congressman weltner makes a fair statement of the doctrine of the southern moderate as a southerner it was hard for me to contemplate the changes that were being sought but as an american i knew that manifest wrongs to a substantial number of the nations people required a remedy the remedy for congressman weltner was the law his feelings about race and the solution to the manifest wrongs to a substantial number of the nations people is to fall in line with the law this makes no demand on his sense of morality or ethics on the race question however obeying the law is really just the beginning of the solution but it is a start and men like weltner are appearing with some regularity in the south they are an interesting breed and one of them writing about himself with honesty makes interesting readingbrooks johnsonyou have heard it from other sources white people have heard it too when martin_luther_king jr says oppression is just as damaging to the oppressor as to the oppressed many people shrug and think he is attempting to win greater support for his cause the bare truth is that those who stand by mute and allow the rights of others to be destroyed are paving the way for the capricious denial of their own rights hodding carters so the heffners left mccomb doubleday is another of a series of books illustrating this truth there are a number of books from the south written by those of the white race who have had their own damaging personal brush with the race issue most of these people were not liberals or radicals they were guilty only of sympathy tolerance and quasichristianity to the rest of the south this deviation from the cracker line is heresy and retribution is swift crude and effective the heffners are what we have come to think of as being in the mississippi tradition she physically attractive as the mississippi beauty queens have been he the white delta look of many of the middle class ambitious men of the south in most ways they were like their neighbors active in segregated community affairs but somewhere along the line they had the decency to talk in their home with some white civil_rights workers one a minister for this they were literally forced out of their state ostracized and forced to sell their home they were denied their rights just as effectively as many negroes have been denied their birthright the story of how this was accomplished is interesting and well told but the real value lies in the fact that perhaps as a result more people will better understand martin_luther_king jr when he says oppression knows no color oppression and oppressor alike are stripped of their dignity and rights or as john donne said long ago no man is an island we are all involved in all of what happens to all of mankindbrooks johnson the value of an anthology is that it brings together the best poems or a group of poems on a certain subject or introduces new poems or new poets ordinarily such a book as langston hughess bilingual la poesie negro americaine editions seghers n p would not be of interest to american readers for since it is the first fullscale anthology of black american poets in french the compiler need only have repeated the selections of previous american anthologies however mr hughes has made enough fresh additions to make this book of value to american readers the selection from m b tolson is an example in three previous anthologies the editors used only his dark symphony a choice which helped to prevent this excellent poet from being more widely known as there were other more recent and better poems of his available but in this book mr hughes has included a section from tolsons libretto for the republic of liberia in an amusing footnote the editor states that tolsons language was impossible to translate and the english alone is given a large part of the book which ranges from phillis wheatley to david henderson is given to newer poets those who have one or more poems which cling to the memory are julia fields bob kaufman ray durem leroi jones conrad kent rivers raymond patterson g c oden oliver lagrone mari evans james a emanuel lucy smith and worth long the harlem renaissance poets are generously represented with both standard anthology pieces and lesser known work the poems from poets who emerged in the forties are repeats from earlier anthologies but the selections from robert hayden gwendolyn brooks and margaret walker can bear repeating margaret danner has the short piece best loved of africa it is interesting to see what the translators alain bosquet sim copans jean copans francois dodat and jean wagner did with american slang and negro dialect they made no effort to duplicate the meters or to transform them into a french equivalent their translations are literal word for word line for line erwin a salks a laymans guide to negro history quadrangle paperback is a reasonably comprehensive guidebook to information on negro history including phonograph records film strips and reference sources as well as books and magazines as an illustration of the books range there are pages devoted to negro inventors the book deserves a place on all collectors lists jerry cohen and william s murphy have writen a book entitled burn baby burn dutton and co no one who followed the los angeles riots of last year will need to be told the significance of those three words they were the rallying cry and the slogan for the black people in the watts area of la who discovered black_power and were determined to use it to eradicate the presence of everything white in their area the aftermath of black_power on the rampage was people killed injured buildings damaged buildings completely destroyed and material lost in the amount of million dollars the real loss is yet to come the watts riot proved something to the black people of watts and everywhere else under certain circumstances they can literally take over unfortunately watts has not proven very much to the white power structure in the big cities they still deal and perhaps even believe in the old platitudes and archaic theories about race the real repercussions will be felt when the cold reality of black_power interacts negatively against white naivete racial ignorance and neglect and prejudice then will come a fuller more horrible realization of the meaning and the significance of watts burn baby burn is an interesting book because the authors have been painstaking researchers concerning the causes and the consequences of the riots no one person at the scene is likely to have been aware of everything that was going on in that unlikely looking ghetto nevertheless i think the authors understand the basic elements which went into the making of the riot which so upset los angeles smug narcissuslike attitude about race however they also demonstrate some of the symptoms of the ills of the white com munity as a whole which is fine let me elaborate and say that i was there at the time of the riots and visited the watts area during the days of uneasy peace and the nights when the only security clearance was a black skin there was something strangely exhilarating about being black and the fact that being black was the preferential way to be a symbol of securityliterally my salvation the feeling of pride was present even though i was sickened by some of the things i saw taking place the absolute wanton destruction the impulsive violence the irrationality of much that was happening all astonished me but that feeling of unity based upon something that had never before had such a valuea black skinwas also an astonishing experience the authors have captured some of this feeling and i believe it frightened them as it did other whites in the area who understood what was happening for a short time in those few blocks the world as they knew it turned upside down their skins were no longer taken for granted it was no longer a badge of superiority respect and preference to paraphrase the psalm we were black and beautiful oh ye daughters of los angeles the white world was isolated in a furious black world trying to extract its pound of flesh from whitey perhaps it is this fear which obstructs the objectivity of messrs cohen and murphy or perhaps it is the remnant of an atavistic prejudice but in their honest attempt to be impartial factual and dispassionate there are several slips the authors make a point of the hate literature which cropped up at the time of the riot one piece in particular concerns police chief parker in their emphasis on the fact that these leaflets stirred up trouble the authors neglect to give any consideraion to the possible veracity of the material a statement attributed to parker in the leaflets and reproduced over his photograph this man says you commit more crime and violence than anyone else was made by parker the leaflet further reads per cent of those arrested by parkers cops are released without trial but still have arrest records result job discrimination the truth of this and it is true is not discussed by cohen and murphy but the inflammatory nature of the remarks themselves is this demonstrates the principal failing of the white man in his attempt to work out the race problem despite his good intentions and his desire to be fair he still sees the negative aspects of the negroes action before he begins to deal with or even recognize the shortcomings and mistakes of his own world read burn baby burn and discover watts again shakespeare said all the worlds a stage for the late dr melville j herskovits all the world was a laboratory this no doubt sounds like a remarkable statement fine dr herskovits was truly a remarkable man he was perhaps americas premier africanist more than that he was a scholar of immense proportions he was a man who had little tolerance for lethargy be it individual or national he was a democrat in the very finest sense of the word his friends included the president of the united states and numerous heads of state some of whom were former pupils of his as a result he was not impressed with titles but with worth and everyone who came in contact with him was judged on that basis with his death in a dimness came over the area of african studies because he took with him his invaluable ideas notions theories and facts which he had accumulated over more than years of observing in his world laboratory as his constant companion associate and a scholar in her own right no one is better equipped to edit and anthologize selected works of dr herskovits than frances s herskovits his wife editor of the new world negro indiana press the new world negro focuses on the idea that a great deal of understanding of one culture african could be garnered by studying another culture afroamerican sounds rather strange that one can be some thousands of miles and years removed from the original culture and by observing and evaluating the activities mores and customs of descendants of that culture discover substantive truths about another all of this while the descendants are intricately interwoven in a new culture if the hypothesis is startling then the proof offered by dr herskovits is astounding the new world negro is an absolute must to anyone who expects to have a basic understanding of the relationship between the old world culture of africa and the afroamerican culture of today further it is an excellent example of what a fertile imaginative mind coupled with singular scholarship can produce at twice the price the book is still one of the best book buys available almost at the same an army serand a young entered room the and geant negro mens walked toward the shoe shine stand just beyond the door the sergeant was a step ahead and as he climbed up to the chair the youth turned aside and began to wash and shave in one of the wash bowls at the end of the room thats a lot of fruit salad you got on your chest sir the negro attendant said yeah i won

from brushes to the polishing cloth he developed a rhythm like the click of train wheels punctuating it with stacatto snaps of the cloth he bent over the shoes a virtuoso of rhythm rhythm possessed his whole body he rocked from side to side his buttocks began to wag to and fro in the intensity of his rhythm as if on cue the bystander goosed him he leaped into the air and burst into a frantic dance but he still kept his rhythm his feet drumming the floor in a wild beat his eyes bugging oh dont do that dont do that im sensitive the soldier rocked with laughter the attendant resumed shining his shoes but kept glancing fearfully over his shoulder until the shirtsleeved man sauntered out he gave the cloth a final snap all done sir he said the soldier stepped down smiled at the reflection

forgot i say i kill my suds slade walks away i get up and says goodnight the couple and slade says goodnight and go out into the hawk hoping i meet no paddies before tomorrow morning it was hot that sum t mer mostly muggy jl with w n rom the lake but it had cooled qff the day be fore the sun was shining few clouds in the sky the birds were singing a perfect sunday for a wedding i woke up early cooked breakfast washed the dishes and read the sunday papers and told myself that i wasnt nervous and not counting the hours until the ceremony i busied myself with things id been putting off and after awhile it was time to get dressed i laid everything out shined my shoes and showered and shaved i started to get a drink before i left thought better of it went outside got into the car turned on the radio and drove out into the sunshine and clouds and the birds singing most of the things even now are very clear but i cant remember a thing that was playing on the radio i parked the car and went into the lobby and down the stairs the reception was in the basement of a neighborhood hotel in a room they rented for small parties and banquets and receptions they had hired a combo three pieces piano bass and guitar and i could hear the music soft and very pretty as i went down the stairs her father was standing by the door and i spoke and we shook hands and chatted and i turned while we spoke of the pennant race and watched her passing out wedding cake she had very dark hair and her skin was rather tawny and she had a tan and her skin made a very nice contrast with the white lace her teeth were very white in her face as she smiled at people and every now and then she would bite the corner of her lip which means shes listening very closely to what you were saying and she would nod her head and the teeth would release her lip and then the smile i walked over and stood in line and she saw me then and smiled and when i got to the head of the line i shook bobs hand and congratulated him and wished them luck and it was only later when i was talking to her sister and wondering where to put the cake that i remembered that id forgotten to kiss the bride the combo started a number she used to like and i walked over and spoke to her mother and then walked back and said goodbye to her and went outside and drove home i took off my suit and hung it up and put on some shorts and went outside and began washing the car and i didnt get drunk i had done that the night she told me she was going to get married and i figured once was enough the student nonviolent coordinating committees unbudging determination to work out the black mans problem in the black mans way has provoked a strange response from the white side of the tracks suddenly there are uneasy stories about an ominous black nationalism in the south and when stokely carmichael snccs new chairman turned down an invitation to the white house conference on civil_rights this action is suddenly judged to be a new hard line just what does the white man want for a century he urged the negro to stay in his place but now when the negro says all right thats just what ill do and ill make it a better place to behe is called a black nationalist the difference between a negros staying in his place and black nationalism is only a degree of temper the former is servile the latter is angry thats the only difference and the whites might as well admit it when they complain about black nationalism theyre not complaining about anything new but now they are tacitly admitting fear of it and that is new as for snccs refusal to suffer more talk about civil_rights action it does not really seem so radical the school integration decision has been the law of the land for years and less than five per cent of the negroes of the south are attending integrated schools the civil_rights act has been on the books for two years and negroes are still beaten when they try to buy food in public restaurants the voting rights act has been on the books for a year and federal registrars still have not been sent for example to sen james eastlands home county despite frequent pleas for their assistance totting up the need for action snccs impatience with more talk may be tactically unwise but it is surely understandable 11585 100 s а v q e ףv 9 l c
