seek audacious power
by adam clayton powell
lmost  years ago that question was a contemptuous a f inquiry in the book of john and nathanael said unto £ philip can there any good thing come out of nazareth e philip saith come and see  nazareth was the mississippi of galilee there were no great artists or philosopherkings or musicians there was no center of learning such as howard university in this commencement of your life the world will ask  can there any good thing come out of howard as black students educated at americas finest black institution of higher learning you are still secondclass citizens a mere  years in the spectrum of time separates us from the history of slavery and a lifetime of indignities next year on march   howard will celebrate the centennial of its founding next year on march   the committee on education and labor of which i am the chairman will also celebrate its th anniversary how ironic that the committee on education and labor which was formed immediately after the civil war to help black slaves make the transition into freedom should have a black man  years later as its chairman one of the purposes of the committees founding was to take care of howard university it is too late for you who are graduating to know this unless you plan to pursue graduate work here but it is not too late for the faculty to know it the education and labor committee is in charge of howard university howard along with other federal institutions such as st elizabeths and gallaudet college is under the jurisdiction of my committee while both howard and i as chairman of this committee will celebrate our  years together joy of our success is tempered by the sobering fact that our status as black people has been denied firstclass acceptance keith e baird writing in the spring edition of freedomways gives eloquent voice to these thoughts in his poem nemesis you snatched me from my land branded my body with your irons and my soul with the slavename negro how devilish clever to spell it upper case and keep me always lower to possess a black skin today in america means that if you are in los angeles driving your pregnant wife to a hospital youll be shot to death by a white policeman a black skin means that if your family lives in webster county mississippi your average family income will be  a year a week for an entire family a black skin today is an unemployment rate twice that of whites despite a skyrocketing gross national product of  billion dollars and an unprecedented level of employment a black skin means you are still a child that all the white liberals who have helped you to take your first steps toward freedom and manhood now believe they own your soul can manage your lives and control your civil_rights organizations only snick has been able to resist the seductive blandishments of white liberals so beware not only of greeks bearing gifts but colored men seeking loans and northern white liberals at this graduation today this is the reality of self you must face your graduation comes at a particularly critical period of the black mans searching reassessment of who he is what he should become and how he should become it the history of the last  years of the freedom struggle has been capsuled in only two concepts integration and civil_rights during those years our leadersand black people are the only people who have leadersother groups have politicians statesmen educators financiers and businessmenbut during those years our leaders drugged us with the lsd of integration instead of telling us to seek audacious powermore black_powerinstead of leading us in the pursuit of excellence our leaders led us in the sterile chase of integration as an end in itself in the debasing notion that a few white skins sprinkled amongst us would somehow elevate the genetics of our development as a result ours was an integration of intellectual mediocrity economic inferiority and political subservience like frightened children we were afraid to eat the strong meat of human rights and instead sucked the milk of civil_rights from the breasts of white liberals black uncle toms and aunt jemimas from the book of hebrews a diet of courage is offered to black people for every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil historically strong meat was too risky for most black people for it would have enabled them to discern both good and evil the difference between civil_rights and human rights human rights are godgiven civil_rights are manmade civil_rights has been that grand deception practiced by those who have not placed god first who have not believed that godgiven rights can empower the black man with superiority as well as equality our life must be purposed to implement human rights  the right to be secure in ones person from the excessive abuses of the state and its lawenforcing officials  the right to freedom of choice of a job to feed ones family  the right to freedom of mobility of residence  the right to the finest education mans social order can provide  and most importantly the right to share fully in the governing councils of the state as equal members of the body politic to demand these godgiven human rights is to seek black_power what i call audacious powerthe power to build black institutions of splendid achievement howard university was once well on its way toward becoming a lasting black institution of splendid achievement when it struggled to contain the intellectual excitement and dynamic creativity of such black scholars as alain locke sterling brown e franklin frazier sam dorsey eugene holmes james nabrit and rayford logan all on the campus at the same time what glorious symbols they were of black creativity but where are the black symbols of creativity of  where is the greatness of our yesteryears where are the sonnets black poets once sung of the black mans agony of life can any good thing come out of howard today  iv  there can and there must i call today for a black renaissance at howard university resurrect black creativity not only in literature history law poetry and english but more so in mathematics engineering aerodynamics and nuclear physics like nicodemus howard must be born againborn again in the image of black greatness gone before will one black woman here today dare to come forth as a pilgrim of god a sojourner truthas a black moses harriet tubmanor a nannie burroughs will one black man here today dare be a denmark vesey a nat turner a frederick douglass a marcus garvey a w e b dubois or a malcolm_x one with god is a majority this divine oneness can restore howard to the glory of charlie houston whose classrooms were the womb of the civil_rights movementa womb that birthed a thurgood marshall but the womb has aborted and the good thing which nvt r rhoward must also come out of black peop   v  ask yourselves that higher question can any good thing come of black people we are the last revolutionaries in americathe last transfusion of freedom into the blood stream of democracy because we are we must mobilize our wintry discontent to transform the cold heart and white face of this nation indeed we must drop our buckets where we are we must stop blaming whitey for all our sins and oppressions and deal from situations with strength why sit down at the bargaining table with the white man when you have nothing with which to bargain why permit social workers and various leagues and associations to represent us when they are representing the decadent white power structure which pays their salaries their rent and tells them what to say such men cannot possess the noble arrogance of power that inspires men moves nations and decides the fate of mankind i call for more arrogance of power among black people but an arrogance of power that is godinspired godled and goddaring as cassius said the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in yourselves that we are underlings so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity we can cancel the captivity of our souls and destroy the enslavement of our minds by refusing to compromise any of our human rights the era of compromise for the black man is gone birmingham harlem and watts have proved this you cannot compromise mans right to be free nor can you sit down and reason together whether man should have some rights today and full rights tomorrow let somebody reason with mrs barbara deadwyler in los angeles that a white policeman really did not intend to kill her black husband let somebody tell her that the passion of her love for her husband should bow to the reason of diaphanous official alibis only god can reason with her and soothe her grief and there is a god who rules above with a hand of power and a heart of love and if im right hell fight my battle and i shall be free this day this same god calls us first to the conference table and his son when the word of reason was no longer heeded went into the temple and began to cast out those that sold those who sell black people down the river must be cast out those conference tables which defile the human spirit must be overturned conferences are for people who have time to contemplate the number of angels dancing on a civil_rights pin conferences are for people who seek a postponement until tomorrow of a decision which screams for a solution today conferences are an extravagant orgy of therapy for the guiltridden and a purposeless exercise in dialectics for the lazy america has been holding too many conferences conducting too many seminars writing too many books and articles about the black man and his right to freedom for over a century this week  black and white people will gather once again in our nations capital to whisper words of futility into the hurricane of massive indifference certainly the federal government should cease to be a partner in this cruel historic charade with the black mans rights to fulfill these rights let us begin with first things first the largest single employer in the united states is the federal government  employees yet racial discrimination within the government more subtle more sophisticated more elegantly structuredcontinues almost as rampant as yesterday the times have changed but the system hasnt though racial persecution presses its crown of thorns on our brows our faith in god must never falter we must sustain that faith which helps us to cast off the leprosy of selfshame in our black skins and lift us up to the glorious healing power of belief in the excellence of black_power we must have the faith to build mighty black universities black businesses and elect black men as governors mayors and senators our faith must be sustained by our passion for dignity and our trust in god not mans faithless reason in himself what is easierto say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk black children of howard take up thy beds and walk into the new era of excellence arise and walk into a new spirit of black pride can there any good thing come out of nazareth come and see said philip nathanael came and saw jesus and the world felt as he did the power of his love and the beauty of his words can there any good thing come out of howard university here today come and see you howard graduates must say come and see us erect skyscrapers of economic accomplishment scale mountains of educational excellence and live among the stars of audacious political power come and see us labor for the black massesnot the black leadersbut the black masses who have yearned for audacious leadership 
violenci in america
by dr karl menninger
interest in semantics makes me very uncomfortable j  f to hear the word violence used as if it were equivalent to  iwll  lawlessness and the word violence used as if it were equivad d lent to crime or equivalent to murder these are all such different things that im uneasy about the abstraction violence as describing a lot of things that we usually dont like thats why i thought it would be useful if we put down the sort of violence that we disapproved of as a teaching device i often like to change the nature of the reduction suppose we talk about a poker game that seems frivolous enough violence in a poker game is not a very serious matter but lawlessness is perhaps youre not westerners enough to know this nobody gets thrown out of a poker game for violenceperhaps they shouldbut they do for lawlessness once break the rules in a gentlemans game and youre out you can be as violent as you please if the walls will stand it and the furniture will stand it well within limits now in a way this is an example of what errors i think we get into when we keep talking about violence and lawlessness i have only taken two i talked with dr satten and perhaps he will make some further distinctions between words which we in psychiatry use with a good deal more conscientious caution we dont accuse an individual of being violent when he has only been lawless or vice versa then we take a shocking examplelets compare for example the assassination of julius caesar to the assassination of president kennedy i happen to have been like most of my fellow americans a great admirer of mr kennedy and i think the tragedy of his death is almost beyond any words that we could utter but lets look at the fact that the assassination was not very violent all the man did was slightly move his finger whereas brutus had to charge up the steps with the dagger in his hand face the man he was about to kill tell him what he was doing it for and kill him now this glorification of violence which is our heritage as the historian said and which we have praised for centuries as being the earmarks of courage virility manliness and anything else certainly come under a cloud were denouncing violence when i think we mean to denounce something elsedestructivenesswhich usually today is nonviolent most destructiveness today is not accomplished by violence violence is for little fellows violence is for the people that dont know any better violence is like common sense its what the average man has to deal with but destructiveness can now be expressed in such mechanical ways such remote ways such magic ways that our concern it seems to me is actually not so much with violence as with something inside of us which makes us destructive and which makes us willing to be lawless or sadistic or criminal or whatever necessary if we can some way or other make the end justify any means professor freud after spending a lifetime educating his students and the public to the idea that there were within us repressed sexual feelings which caused some of us trouble came to a sudden realization when he was well past middle age and said to his associates gentlemen my critics have said i was too preoccupied with sex and i think they are right now there is something inside the human breast which is also repressed which causes more trouble than sexual frustrations and that is the propensity of human beings to hurt one another to be destructive to be aggressive freud then postulated the dual instinct theory which many of his followers did not accept but which i and many of my friends think is essential you see if you take the view that civilization has in a sense been the progressive repudiation and relinquishing of certain natural trends in the human being you might say civilization goes constantly against the natural law not in the catholic sense but in the psychological sense it seems to be natural for animals including ourselves to assert our own need to try to attain by whatever means necessary what we want when will we learn gradually both in the childhood of the individual and in the childhood of the race that you have to make concessions to the needs of other people you can go even furtheryou can even enjoy making such concessions thats the beginning of the development of the psychological maturity of the individual and the race which puts agape ahead of eros which puts concern ahead of the other person ahead of even the expediency of being good to the other person because he then might be good to you we havent reached it very generally to be sure but we have gone far enough to    let me put it another waycivilization has gone to the point where it no longer glorifies aggression as it did its a little ashamed of its violence and its aggression and it does by machinery what it used to do by hand in this sense violence decreases at the wrong place you might say i think if executions were done today as they originally were done in public so that you would see the official violence committed by the state there would be fewer of them even though we know that the desire to see and enjoy violence vicariously is in all of us one of the gentlemen said we tolerate a little violence ladies and gentlemen we not only tolerate it we love it its exciting we put it in the front page of the paper a third or a fourth of our television programs for the amusement of the children are exhibitions of how you can slug them how you can knock them out how you can kick them how you can kill them at long distance or short distance this is what we think is exciting dont forget that violence is condoned my dear friends its enjoyedahproviding theres some escape clause you know in all navaho rugs to give you a little change of mood for a moment the skillful weavers leave one strand of the weaving carried from the simple theme to the edge of the rugwhat looks to nonnavahos as some kind of mistake this is not a mistake this is an alibi this is a way out this is a way to say i havent given away tribal secrets this is the way for the magic of the rug to escape the escape clause so to speak now theres an escape clause in all our violence todaythe forms of violence we can still enjoy a typical illustration of this is the prize fight it seems negligible unimportant and so forth now you see it isnt if you think of this as an example in which the enjoyment of violence can still be permitted even though it is murderous it is mayhem it is corruption as you all know economically it is about everything you could name ordinarily as bad but if it has a name of the right sort if it has a conventional history if it gets by as an escape it is a way in which we can bring the most brutal and aggressive violence right into our livingroom few people today would want to go out and take two of the largest dogs in the community and put them in a pen and see them fight to death this is not quite done according to the rules we dont do it that way weve other ways of being cruel no farmer today would enjoy having two of his bulls gore each other to death but put it in the right auspices and this is lots of fun people think this is wonderful and a large number of our people want to see it extended i think these examples will give you a clue to my own feeling about it and that is that i think it is inevitable who will take the position that all aggression is as judge bazelon says bad it wont be a matter of seeking what kind of aggression can i find today that will be good ill do a little good aggression today but the bad aggression is all the other peoples well get them into court as fast as possible and stop it if one sees aggression in the literal sense the wish to hurt injure other people whether they are criminals whether they are indians or other life whether they are animals living their own peaceful existence whether they are children whatever the other form our task is to eliminate as far as we can to control to harness to sublimate to direct our own aggressive impulses and that of our colleagues away from the enjoyment of causing pain in other people i dont believe there is such a thing as good aggression now youre going to say to me well now arent you carrying this too far what would you do if somebody came to your house and  wanted to kill your children wouldnt you be aggressive of course i would i dont say that all occasions for the necessary use of something bad have disappeared i wouldnt ordinarily crawl out through the top of an elevator car for athletic amusement but i did last week in new york because we got stuck between floors and remained there for a half an hour i did some very extraordinary things that i wouldnt ordinarily do i would say if somebody comes to my house and attacks me i shall exercise myself as vigorously as possible however in the meantime i dont intend to provide an arsenal and dont intend to stock up with a number of guns revolvers and other weapons so that i can keep the villain out personally i think this would be a thin disguise for my own aggressive impulses that almost it seems to me would be inviting some masochist to come in and see if i can hit him im not going to experiment i dont think in psychiatry generally there is an agreement with so flatfooted a quaker position as i take if you stop to think the joys of yesteryear were largely those of killing something in my part of the country especially a little further west most of the northern california indians were shot off as a matter of sport by your ancestors and mine who lived there it was considered good weekend fun to go out and kill a few indians as a hunting exercise the same thing was done in many other places but this was so well documented one whole large tribe was exterminated just north of here a little way you must remember that this was done with the blessing of the community of course some of the women thought it was a rather rough sport it would be much better if their husbands stayed home and knocked each other out in a slug fest or something but some of the boys wanted to go out and get a little blood and they did you see i find it quite foreign to my concept of psychiatry to regard these to discount this as being the work of the psychotic population my dear friends i think were all a psychotic population there is no such thing as the psychotic population mental illness is a condition from which everyone of us suffers at one time or another to different degrees and it is neither thee nor thou business or me and thou business to say well those psychotic people theyre the ones that do these things you and i are the psychotic people in the sense that you and i are the ones who are aware that there are fluctuations in our ability to organize and manage our aggressions and the temptations of the outside world some people are less aware of this fact but i think that this holierthanthou attitude toward the psychiatrically ill is incorrect im not going to take a holierthanthou attitude toward the attitude i only make the distinction that i dont think this is the correct way to see it if you take such a survey as that manhattan survey you realize it mental illness is not something that unfortunately drops down on a few individuals like lee harvey oswald and causes him to do surreptitious things mental illness is something that afflicts all of us to some degree all of us at times and many people all of the timeor much of the time with constant fluctuation this view of psychiatry is so different from the old one where we thought we could go through the population and pick out maybe one or three or four out of a thousand who needed the care of the state institution or the boston psychopathic this view of psychiatry is as dead as a dodo we recognize now that this was a limitation of our vision at that time just as we recognize now that shooting off indians at the time when there was a mutualrobbery program going on was the feud of it i often think in sunday school in bible classes how different it looks when you think of the children of israel conquering jericho and marching forth against the occupants how different it looks if you imagine yourself to be a descendant of the occupants the same way the american indians how different it looks if you are a descendant of the navahosless the navahos than the sioux let us say with whom i have spent some time if you look at it from their point how different it looks the war in which custer and others so bravely exterminated the fiendish savage if you happen to be on the other side think how the indians felt about people who felt that it was their privilege to come in and steal your stuff but it was not your privilege to steal theirs here we are a nation that violated  treaties with the indians who never once broke their side of the contract when one talks about lawlessness and violence you must remember as our historian said this has been a pattern which we havent been until recently very much ashamed of you heard it in the political campaign and you hear it in my part of the country quite a bit by god im going to do so and so the very tone of voice is a kind of violence a kind of confession that i do not recognize the necessity to control violence i regard violence as something without which on this rough planet you cant live and im going to observe it in the right way in my judgment of course now these remarks are tendentious and they are not intended to be a calm cold scientific analysis of the topic partly as i say because i think we havent sufficiently clearly identified our topic our kind host said that he was thinking of the kind that seemed unmotivated but if i may terminate what ive been saying by direct reference to that i think that is only because you and i are not close enough to that individual to know what the motives were what seems senseless to us is because we dont know man it isnt the way i would have killed those people it isnt the way that i would have acted on that elevator but i am not he i didnt have the background he did i didnt have the frustrations he did i didnt have the irritations he did i didnt have the insults flung in my face that hes had im imagining a situation but my point is that cases that seem inexplicable to use are so partly because were assuming that the life the background the experiences the motions the suffering of the individuals who do these terrible things that make us shudder with horror are not the same as ours if we mean therefore to study violence we must study the people that cant get along that cant cope with the realities of life in a civilized way i think dr satten my colleague here has contributed something very important in the scientific american article where he points out that our attitude towards offenders has been almost one of saying since i cant understand you i am angry at you therefore i am not willing to try to help you change i only want you punished this conventional attitude should be corrected judge bazelon has been trying to do it for a few individuals sooner or later it seems to me it ought to be an expression of our civilization that we are not interested in returning violence for violence that we are interested in trying to bring about change in the people who cant live in a way that will allow us to be safe especially as we get closer together out west where there are greater spaces where it takes longer for the bad news to spread where people can get away with more without being caught by their neighbors its a different matter from where we live just apartment to apartment now that more people see what human beings act like when theyre a little off guard when they are a little stimulated by you and when they have been a little deficient in the civilizing process there is more interest in trying to find better ways to control a the people who fail to control themselves and commit violence and b those who might do so under the right circumstances which includes all of us 
its in the game

sr eric berne firl missed what might n j j j have been the most provocative and contemporary chapter of all in his currently popular book games people play when he failed to include in it any examples of the games sweeping the circuit of newly integrated neighborhoods there are many they usually in their elementary form involve two players often nextdoor neighbors and women and always one black and one white it is the basic and most important rule one of the most popular is called what she would have said in the old neighborhood and black housewife as usual is it for example white housewife your hair is lovely did you do it yourself black housewife thank you it was getting so dry and unmanageable that i simply had to give myself a permanent  
black dialogue 
learned to read  early when many of the other kids were h outside playing ball or swinging on the playground swingsbefore the time of tvhe was usually curled up with a book of course he played ball and romped with his succession of dogs and skated but he also read and reading took the place a lot of the time of building model airplanes or doing what other seven or eightyearold negroes do the first book his mother gave him was black boy she had always read to him until he had gotten too big and then she began getting him books from the library but black boy was the first book she bought particularly for him she hardly ever told him about the world about what to look for in life unless it was a part of her vision of the promising future he guessed her ways were to be a protection for him but later the only thing he felt they had done was to have him disbelieve in dreams whenever he grew old enough to be made aware of something like sex or that he was a negro and he would be treated differently in the world because of this phenomenon she left him a book on his night table and so she gave him black boy by richard wright to enlighten him and his life long held recurrences of that horrible experience after he had read the autobiography of richard wright he had been psychologically unable to read another negro author for over ten years but his mother never knew and he didnt even admit the fact to himself he had just refused to believe there were any other negro writers and that made it unnecessary even accidentally to relive the trauma of black boy he immediately stopped reading harmless frank yerby when he found that yerby was a negro and he refused until his late teens to read books by whites with negro themes and subjects it was frightening to believe almost everything that one read not that he should not believe an autobiography he told himself but he believed literally in the characters of books when young and in their situations but unfortunately these characters were almost always white no tom sawyer or huck finn for him there were blackmen in them come back up on the raft huck honey the monstrous life that wright portrayed in that book could as well have been histhis was one of the fears he screamed of at night in all his reading until then and most since except for whitman that was the single character with which he felt a definite spiritual kinship and  he attempted to strangle that apparitions first breath his hands are still partially encircling its black throat the description of wrights whitelooking grandmother was like those he had heard of some of his distant relatives and he did have a very fair aunt with long stringy hair who was old enough to be a grandmother and the entire similarity scared him more thoroughly than all the promised damnations of hell in the bible he did not understand why he compared that experience of reading black boy to cringing under the denunciations of the ancient prophets and fearing for the immortal everlasting soul he believed in then but reading that book he somehow feared for himself as he has few times since could it be that in both cases he would be equally lost was to  be black to be told and demonstrated in graphic detail equivalent to smelling fire and brimstone to be among the unsaved it cant be this way his childs mind reasoned i wont believe it is like this i dont live like this no one does at least no one i know so what is this man in this book saying these things for what is he doing to me why is he trying to destroy me with all his will he fought the accusations of living in a false world of childhood and adolescent comfort and smugness but he knew that man spoke the truth that that black man was right that things he described in such brutal detail did really happenonly in a different place he could not believe that such things confronted him down south thats it he reasoned down south for he had heard of down home numerous occasions through tale jest and tabletalk of the elders though he could not imagine where the country was or if it were actually a real place or an illusionary one like the story lands of ghosts and witches and trolls he never knew until much later that he was alreadyand soon would be even moreacquainted with the south and he had such a fear and hate instilled in him for down home that even much later it was vital for him to be objective and not allow prejudice to infect his feelings when he met someone with a hard southern accentwhether they were black or white but most of his newer friends were recently arrived from down home and the way in which they spoke of the land they had fled it was a distant wonderland far superior toand unlikethe then fabulous farm in new jersey of his nearly white aunt they must lie he felt he knew they lied and he secretly hated them the more for their trying to deceive him his new friends from the south acted differently so strange and awkward their first years in the city and not like himself who knew the citys ways he thought then and some of these new friends have never changed he wasnt afraid to speak to whites or shy in their presence like many of his friends were no he went to school with whites everyday and would punch one in the mouth if he wasnt his friend or if he had gotten out of line he even walked sylvia greenglass home each day of his next to last year in elementary school carrying her books and sometimes staying late at her house for the hot creamy chocolate that her mother made on  chilly days sylvia with the auburn hair and pink cheeks and ears that brightened crimson in the wintertime he thought of that day when he walked her home and his friends from school threw snowballs at them and sylvia and he laughed and trotted along with him stooping in the cold scooping up the icy whiteness and returning the volleys at brother and timmy his two friends up seventh street yelling and panting out clouds of steam until one of the snowballs hit sylvias ear the instance froze like it was etched by icicles to freeze his heart then sylvia and he hurried the last six blocks to her house as she cried and his knowing that it was an awful accident which found him helpless after the damage was done but he whispered to himself that he could have prevented it by being nearer her warding off the balls of snow and ice he couldnt explain to mrs greenglass when she opened the door sylvia stood there on the landing whimpering and sputtering about her ear and he begged forgiveness as if he had made the little pink girl his target her mother did not invite him in that afternoon nor any other and sylvia stopped playing with him at recess nor would she allow him to walk her home again he hated the ones who threw at them that afternoon hated them for causing the trouble but they were his friends brother and timmy the other two negroes in the school they called themselves colored in those days he hated his two friends for parting him from a white girl the game today is being probably still played with the exact results brother had a soft southern accent and had been only in the city for a couple years but brother knew more things about the streets and how its people acted than he did they remained friends for over ten years but to him brother was always a southern negro a newcomer and so not really a friend timmy was from a family with a lot of kids and his big brothers always threatened to beat him up and take his possessions until he got big enough not to take threats from anyone to him he seemed long in getting that big but the day came when he couldnt allow any more sleights to go unchallenged and during the course of those years he had lost all those old friends and no others had he hated so much nor has he met since that have replaced them it has been always too easy for him to take up with the white world it has been always too easy to find some sort of acceptance from whites somehow he had learned to speak in a close enough approximation to their way his reading had conditioned him to search in the world for many of their values he had gone to the same schools with them being for the first six years the single negro in his classes and always near the top that type of conditioning is murderous to throw off at once it is subtle and almost sure in most cases to twist a black soul into a hybrid freak of some kind it lulls the victim into refusing to see the darker aspects of the world it gives him a pair of second false blue eyes to gaze distortedly through a black caught like this gets to thinking that white people are all right which isnt hard to believe when he is far enough out of the mans reach and his mother has a civil service job but then later when he grows up there are other factors to consider weird factors which lead to the edge of insanity » he wonders after a while and he tries again to reorganize his multihued funnypaper collaged world with strictly white values thinking white logic with blackwhite experiences and often he becomes bitter or skeptical or worse especially when he finds it is other blacks closer to him doing him more obvious treachery than the whites when he finds that he is not white even though his mind wishes to believe there is a sameness that his inner black eyes cannot detect he wishes to stop believing in justice fair play honor and truth why did they prepare me only for this lie he wonders when one finds he must become unfeeling out of a sense of protection as those who do not feel nor wish to know or feel then sometimes he turns his back upon his own people and upon himself and becomes all the more disillusioned for that is when he is really alone and is lost    the white world prepares the black man in a single universal skill treachery to his fellows v no man lies to a black man more than another black man no man cheats or is ready to kill another black man as quickly as another black man one must become accustomed to the perplexities of this brotherhood if he is to survive and learn and understand why one must lose faith for faith is never quite enough one must throw away belief for belief is held by every black fool one must be blown apart by all that one has been taught and reassembled in the vacuum of ignoranceofblack to form the vessel of new experience there is not a white man alone he feared to face though he is wary of each of his black brothers for ancient betrayal waits behind each smile and set of dark eyes all white groups he enters with caution for the collective will of their numbers is to keep him in his place whether it is in front of the firing squad or standing at a poduim before an expanse of equally black faces no black group does he fear but it is the influence of the manipulators in the outer wings which he cares to avoid it is as true today as it was  years ago in this land blacks meet together only because some white desires their congregation

us expansion a  ?    « weapon against
by jack d forbes
 expansion of the united states might sseem an anachronism cztkra« j n a ge verba j antiimperialism but that precisely is what i propose to doalthough in truth both the rationale and method of my suggested expansionis i are somewhat unique from the war for independence until the s the united states was one of the most expansionistic nations on earth rivaling the british french and russian empires in the relationship of original size to the extent of new territory added unlike the typical european government however the united states followed a policy of absorbing the new territories as integral parts of the nation as states subject only to the limitation that angloamericans had to predominate over natives thus statehood was never available to indians or to native hawaiians and oklahoma new mexico arizona hawaii and alaska all had to wait until the nonwhites had become sufficiently outnumbered or anglicized and neutralized angloamerican imperialism assumed a new form precisely when it came into contact with regions inhabited by nonwhites who were too numerous to be outnumbered where angloamericans could never predominate generally speaking the flag could not go this racist and ethnocentric doctrine ironically was a major factor in saving mexico in the s hawaii temporarily in the s the dominican republic in the s and probably cuba the philippines and other regions at a later date nevertheless imperialism continued but it assumed the form of acquiring economic and political dominance over foreign nations without formal annexation the united states was freed from the problem of reconciling the constitution with colonialism does the constitution follow the flag and freed from facing up to the ideal that all u s territories possess a right to eventual statehood the united states in brief established a protectorate over much of the americas and more recently over the pacific area and was thus able to benefit from empire without being forced to face the problems posed by the direct administration of subject peoples except of course in the philippines samoa puerto rico the canal zone guam hawaii and the various indian tribal regions this protectorate system continues to exist especially in relation to the caribbean region president lyndon b johnson both in sending marines to intervene in a purely internal rebellion and in asserting the united states right to intervene anywhere in the americas has reaffirmed the old teddy roosevelt philosophy but in addition to this straightforward presidential policy the united states has long used ambassadors aid programs and the cia to influence other governments and of course most of the caribbean nations are economically dominated by the united states the ironic effect of the above is that the dominican republic and the other small nations of the caribbean would possess more freedom from federal u s interference and greater autonomy as states of the united states than they do as socalled independent republics as states they would be protected by the constitution and by the courts they could socialize the economy by confiscating illegallyacquired private property and they could elect senators and representatives who would have an impact on federal policies as republics they are not protected by the constitutions separation of powers doctrinethey are subject to federal u s intervention without constitutional restraint they are in short subjected to behavior which would never be tolerated by a sovereign state of the united states is this reasoning false then let us for a moment contrast the sovereignty of states such as mississippi and alabama with that of the dominican republic the former are states wherein virtually half the population is subjected to violence is held in a subordinate status and is denied the right to exercise constitutional privileges the governments of mississippi and alabama are in fact in a state of rebellion against the united states even to the extent of the flying of a rebel flag and the wearing of rebel insignias in alabama but has this led to intervention has president johnson dispatched marines to protect american lives and to separate the antagonists has federal power been exerted to organize coalition whitenegro governments it is generally true that the federal government rarely intervenes in the affairs of states even in the face of the most blatant provocations little rock and oxford being notable and rather smallscale exceptions on the other hand the federal government finds it much easier to intervene overseas as it has within our own century in haiti cuba the dominican republic nicaragua panama colombia mexico guatemala and elsewhere the dominican republic unlike mississippi and alabama does not possess representation in congress nor votes in presidential elections as indicated above no constitutional guarantees enforceable by an independent judiciary protect its interests therefore president johnson is able to dispatch marines on a large scale to dominicana to prevent the reestablishment of constitutional government and in fact to dictate the form a new government will assume can anyone imagine such an intervention in the south for these and other reasons to be outlined below i feel that the only decent policy for the united states to pursue is to make formal offers of immedate statehood to dominicana haiti jamaica puerto rico micronesia the ryukyus and to other regions which are either colonies or protectorates of the united states please bear in mind that i do not advocate the unilateral annexation of these areas i merely wish to offer the various protectorates of the united states a choice between their present status subject to the capricious intervention of the federal government and a status wherein they possess an influence upon that government the dominican republic as was cuba prior to castro is in fact a territory of the united states it should be allowed the option of statehood another important point in relation to the caribbean region is that the united states regards the several islands therein as being of such great strategic significance as to be for practical purposes a part of the united states home defense system as things now stand the united states will never allow any of these islands to pursue independent courses of action this is true of cuba as well after all the united states was not kidding in the bay of pigs affair given this reality should not the united states at least offer the west indians the right to vote in presidential elections and thereby have some say in their own security system the caribbean republics have nominally two choices now on the one hand they can remain protectorates of the united states or on the other hand they can seek freedom of action within the context of the communist bloc cuba was able to make that choice the others however will not be able to follow that path for the simple reason that the united states will undoubtedly intervene with full force in any leftwing revolution any attempt therefore to establish other cubas will simply result in the killing of thousands of people and u s military occupation therefore the only realistic alternative to a protectorate status is that of statehood the situation is somewhat different in the case of puerto rico micronesia samoa the canal zone and the ryukhus these regions are already attached to the united states by formal instruments my proposals here are very simple we should encourage the formation of a polynesian federation which samoa can join or  as an alternative allow samoa and any of its neighbors to form a state micronesia the trust territory of the pacific and guam should be allowed the option of statehood here no other alternative can be provided since the united states will doubtless never let these islands go for military reasons the ryukyus should be offered the choice of statehood or reunion with japan but the latter is not a likely course of action since the united states seems firmly attached to this military bastion perhaps in this instance it might be possible to create a selfgoverning ryukuan free state under the joint supervision of the united states and japan but in the event that the united states chooses to retain unilateral control what other decent alternative is there to an offer of statehood the case of the canal zone is somewhat unique in that it involves an area not suited for either statehood or independence but then the zone is nothing more or less than u soccupied panama and it should be turned over to the latter if on the other hand military considerations are such that we cannot part with the zone then we should offer panama statehood and the canal that would provide the panamanians with a unified territory and with some say in the control of their own destiny puerto rico is an associated free state or commonwealth of the united states as such it possesses nearly the same powers as a state internally but has no voting representation in washington many people are under the impression that puerto rico can have statehood or independence if she wishes the truth is however that puerto rico could never be independent of the united states except in a strictly formal sense and statehood must be approved by congress rumor from washington has it that congress is not encouraging puerto rico to ask for statehood and it may be that cultural and racial chauvinists are opposed to a state not dominated by angloamericans nevertheless it would be a good gesture for congress to pass an enabling act allowing puerto rico to assume statehood at the latters discretion such a step would help to diminish the worlds suspicion that the united states is intolerant of racial and cultural minorities my advocacy of offers of statehood to all of the aforementioned regions is based on the rather simple principle that all men should possess the right of local selfgovernment and the right to directly participate in the formulation of nonlocal and international policies the peoples of the caribbean micronesia samoa and the ryukyus among others are not allowed one or both of these fundamental rights and it is intolerable that the united states should be the power preventing the exercise of those rights therefore either the united states must cease intervening overseas and give away its colonies or it must pursue forthwith the only decent alternative that of offering statehood and the rights of citizenship to these peoples but in all frankness there are other reasons behind my favoring the growth of the united states for one i am a little afraid of the provincial angloamerican as he is found in his purity especially in the south and middle west i like the white anglosaxon diluted as he is in new york boston new orleans san francisco los angeles santa fe san antonio and all of the other more interesting and culturally more productive regions of the united states i do not care for the middle towns or suburbs where the anglo predominates to the exclusion of other groups and here i include those irishamericans germanamericans et cetera who have become completely anglicized i am frankly worried about the domestic and foreign policies apparently favored by the present consensus among anglo politicians and i am even more frightened by the lunatic right with its notsolatent racist potential in short i believe that we need a new infusion of the kind of invigoration formerly provided by immigration and of the kind of counterbalancing diverse sectional interests favored by madison in the federalist papers for this reason also i would favor union with canada but that is another subject in a similar vein i strongly desire a greater cosmopolitanism within the united states and a more varied cultural atmosphere with increased opportunity for contributions by nonanglos we need the healthy influence of more mulattoes more negroes more mestizos more pacific islanders and more latins and not only are the cultural variations provided by  these peoples fascinating and enriching but i personally find that the hybrids who result from the intermingling of such peoples are extremely attractive physically and otherwise there should be more hawaiis more seriously however the united states must rapidly become more cosmopolitan if it is to successfully meet its responsibilities as the leading power in the noncommunist world the american people must become more sophisticated more tolerant and better informed i do believe that union with nonanglo peoples will help not only to demonstrate the existing degree of tolerance in the united states but to actually further the process of cosmopolitanization and sophistication  needless to state chauvinists and rightwingers will most certainly oppose my plan for the growth of the united states precisely out of fear of the reasons for which i advocate it they do not want more orientals more negroes more mixedbloods and more race mixture they do not want to see their dear old angloamerican provincial culture further diluted although they will accept pizza above all they do not wish to see votes go to people who might well suppport socialism or economic reform or who will suport strong civil_rights programs or who might well seek to tone down the unilateralism of united states foreign policy and then of course these same people have never really given a hoot about freedom for nonanglos in order to preserve the freedom or advance the interests of angloamericans as they see it they have been perfectly willing to take freedom away from other peoples the opposition of the chauvinists to my plan only serves however to strengthen my faith in its essential wisdom and justice why shouldnt we make a try at it after all an offer of statehood is probably one of the least offensive things that we can do and it may be that the united states is destined to grow again whether or not you or i wish it let us make sure that its growth is by voluntary and legitimate meansand not alone by the progress of marching armies 
the way i see it
by bill veeck
e are such hypocrites when alvin dark was quoted as e in team pride cries of righteous indignation filled the air utumirqjiu and yet anyody who has spent any time around ball parks knows that if dark did say what he was quoted as saying he was only echoing what was being muttered on every bench and in every clubhouse it was unfortunate that either alvin did not get down to specifics or that the columnist in quoting him preferred to approach the issue in generalities as a way of opening up the subject to the widest possible discussion and debate it was unfortunate too that because dark himself happens to come from the south anything he might say is evaluated by a completely different set of standards than if hubert humphrey had said it now no one can tell me that alvin didnt know his own ballplayers better than anyone else or that alvin didnt see what he saw if he had said that orlando cepeda who happens to come from puerto rico or that willie mccovey who happens to be an american negro werent the leading candidates for the team player of the year award hed have found any number of baseball people ready to agree with him dark isnt the first manager to feel that cepeda wasnt putting out to the limits of his capabilities nor would he have been the first to say that mccovey tended to lose interest in that rather large portion of the ball game when he wasnt at the plate swinging a bat of course baseball people have always said that jackie brandt doesnt play up to his capabilities either and no one has ever felt it necessary to observe that they sure do grow them lazy in nebraska they just nicknamed him flakey and let it go at that what you always have to bear in mind is that cepeda may very well feel in his heart that he is playing to the peak of his ability at first anyway but human nature is human nature if you keep telling a player he is lazy he just may say to himself all right ill show them how lazy i can be it takes a little imagination to perceive that anybody who is called the baby bull needs coddling and yet i have a strong hunch that if every time a giant manager had felt like blasting cepeda he had called in the newspapermen and told them what a joy it was to have the baby bull on his team things would be a lot calmer along the banks of san francisco bay these days as for mccovey    well they kept telling me for twenty years that ted williams took a very casual attitude toward fly balls too but nobody even felt moved to draw any generalities about tall lefthanded hitters from san diego but whatever limitations mccovey may have when he is not swinging at a fast ball are certainly not the limitations of a teammate named willie mays as dark would be the first to attest mays is a flaming genius in the outfield he catches everything he cuts off balls between outfielders he makes the right throw to the right base he is in the starting lineup day after day until he quite literally drops from exhaustion we all know how that story reads by now mays collapses into a dead faint and the giants lose two or three games before he gets back into the lineup one might even say that willie is the symbol of the team man in baseball just as jackie robinson was the symbol of the competitor you can tell me latinamerican players are lazy and i will listen to you politely but please do not tell me that minnie minoso whom i first signed out of cuba in  was lazy minnie would be in there hustling for  games a year he might be carrying ten pounds of tape around his body but hed still be giving you his standard  percent because minnie was one of the greatest competitors i have ever seen if we want to talk about team spirit we can talk about maury wills leading the dodgers to the pennant although he was sliding on legs that were raw and bloody if we want to compare iqs we can talk about bill white of the cardinals who made himself into a topflight player through intelligence and application i can remember a game when my dear friend larry doby tried to steal home against the yankees in a ridiculous situation and i stated publicly that it was a stupid play because it was but that didnt make him stupid because hes not i just wanted to know what had got into him you can understand why stupid people do stupid things it is always difficult to understand why a bright man does a stupid thing in other words if we started to list the exceptions to the overall indictment we just might end up with a list containing more names than the nonexceptionswhich would put the exceptions in the majority and make the nonexceptions the exceptions and    aw lets forget about it the point im trying to make here quite obviously is that individuals are bright and dumb selfish and selfsacrificing good and bad races are just a collection of individuals i suppose that the negro will know he has come to full equality when he is granted the glorious right to take all the credit for his triumphs and all responsibility for his failings i do not expect it to happen tomorrow morning a home run is without color nationality or previous condition of servitude and so is a bonehead play it may not be completely irrelevant that the terms bonehead play and rockhead were a part of the language of baseball while the color line still stood pure and inviolable if we check the record books we may even discover that they were applied to players who were light of hue and backed to the hilt by generations of good anglosaxon forebears the difference of course is that nobody has ever said there goes that dumb white soandso again    this does not mean that im copping out on the subject by delivering the usual profound and resounding liberal manifestos which are really meant to prove that i am pure of heart i think the indictment whether dark made it or not has enough merit in enough cases to be worthy of much closer examination we need more than anything else to be less selfconscious about race it has become so difficult to discuss this subject on its merits because you are a loser no matter which way you go it is an accepted part of one branch of american folklore that the negro is almost a different speciesand not a higher one these people are willing to concede that the negro is superior physically because he is inferior mentally a somewhat dubious compliment to the other side it is holy writ couched though it may be in vague scientific terms that there is absolutely no difference between any people anywhere and that anyone who thinks there is or might be is a dirty bigot who should be stoned out of the communitypresumably toward the end of keeping that spirit of scientific inquiry alive at the risk of being stoned i want to stand up boldly and say that there is a difference between black and white black is darker white is lighter if we cant agree on that were in real trouble there are physical differences between races too when i was in japan last year to telecast the japanese allstar game the one thing that impressed me above everything else was the weakness of japanese throwing arms even though their ball parks are somewhat smaller than ours no outfielder is expected to make a throw directly to a base a cutoff man goes out automatically to relay all throws the way it was explained to me the japanese shoulder is so constructedon a downward slopethat it is almost impossible for them to throw a ball that will rise as soon as a boy gives any indication of having a strong arm he is pressed into service as a pitcher and here as it was explained to me is the most interesting part of all almost all pitchers i was told are the fruit of a mixed marriage with an inhabitant of one of the offshore islands it is an infusion of blood in other words that changes the construction of the shoulder w but that isnt too surprising either who among us hasnt observed that the mixture of oriental and white blood produces women whose beauty takes the breath away i believe it is known among the more learned academicians in mississippi as mongrelization the american negro has a physical difference too he can run faster and jump higher question asked with an appropriate sneer what authority do you cite mr veeck for this flat unequivocal and unscientific statement answer the greatest authority i know the authority of my own observations which means far more to me than anything out of an anthropologists tract i know that negroes can run faster because i have observed them running faster on baseball and football fields i have observed that when the six finalists in any dash event of any national track meet to say nothing of conference championships crouch over the starting line a minimum of five of them will be negroes usually it is all six my eyes also tell me that negroes jump higher because i can see that almost all the best high jumpers are negroes and so are almost all the best rebounders in the national basketball association to say nothing of any college campus i am able to cite one other authority to support me you almost all sports fans and certainly all athletes accept the fact that negroes run faster and jump higher give me all the theories you can find about sociological and economic forcesand i will give you a few backbut lets not permit anybody to bull us into saying that we dont know what we are seeing there are sociological economic and psychological factors that push the negro into sports sure that can hardly be the entire story though because i am sure there are plenty of towhaired farm boys from nebraska who want to win the meter olympic dash just as badly and practice as hard as any negro boy they just get shut out in the quarterfinals thats all after all records are falling in all track events these days and white runners are setting their share of the new ones the same sociologic and economic pressures would surely apply to all events it is only in all the dashes and the high jump that the negro has his monopoly in point of fact there is a physical basis to account for their superiority as dashmen and jumpers the negro has a somewhat different bone formation in his ankle which gives him an extra cushion off which to spring basketball is a game which seems to have been practically invented for the negro it is a game of particularly sharp reflex of sudden spurts and quick stops of jumping and of timing it is therefore logically enough a game which is becoming increasingly dominated by negroes the nba has already reached the stage where the operators for reasons having to do with nothing more than customer identification are willing to take a  and  man who are white over negroes who have slightly more ability you will notice that i slipped in the words sharp reflex and i can already hear the snickering out there that goes yeah and they all have rhythm too huh the implication being that anyone who dares to say that negroes have a more basic sense of rhythm is giving him the benefit of the doubt stupid giving myself the benefit of the doubt i dont think im so stupid the national league is superior to the american league these days becauseand no one even bothers to argue this anymore except a few chronic searchers after lost causesbecause the national league stocked up on negro players while the american league was sitting back and admiring how nicely the yankees were getting along without them in  the national league had fifteen  hitters twelve of them were colored the year before the national league had eleven  hitters ten of them were colored it would seem fairly clear then that negroes are better hitters than whites no not more deprived not better motivated we re not talking about that better hitters hitting is reflex and timing in short rhythm it is always possible that there are physicalmeaning biological factors involved that go far beyond our knowledge in the first place what is a negro we have a way in this country of arbitrarily characterizing anybody with any negro blood in him as negro it would seem to me that anybody with one negro grandparent is three quarters white and that my side is entitled to take credit for  percent of him remembering what the infusion of island blood does for the japanese throwing arm and sighing over those bea itiful eurasian women i have to wonder whether anybody has really conducted meaningful and objective experiments on the relationship of the percentage of negro blood to athletic ability wouldnt it be funny if they really owed it all to us the real question is why there should be any question of the negros superiority in these directions at all the answer i suppose is that both races seem to be more comfortable ignoring it the white man doesnt like to think that the negro is superior in a basic test of strength and skill the negro knows that to be superior is to be different and he has learned that differences have a way of being used against him still i have a sneaking suspicion that when negroes gather together in the privacy of their own parlors they are quite willing to boast about their physical superiority over their little white brothers as for the economic and sociological factors they are so apparent that they are almost not worth going into the american negro is not as far removed from the purely physical life as the white man he is after all only  years removed from the harsh life of slavery he still finds himself on the whole limited to harsh physical work next time you see a crew of movers you will notice that the white men have assigned themselves the arduous task of telling the negro how to carry a piano on his back this is known as integration italics editors having been denied the fruits of our soft society the negro has been denied the luxury of growing soft in the bone and muscle negro athletes even last much longer than white athletes which can only mean that the point of physical deterioration comes much earlier even in the best trained white athlete the economic problem is simple the performing artssports and entertainmenthave attracted a disproportionate share of the negro population because they have provided the only fields to which the negro has had free entree it could almost be said that if a negro has it in him to be an athlete he has to give it a try and because he knows there is a stone wall waiting for him to butt his head against in the event he doesnt make it he will throw all his energy into developing his talents now that seems to fly in the face of our original theme doesnt it if the negro can run faster react quicker and is in addition more highly motivated how can it also be said that he is lacking in team pride and spirit an entirely different set of circumstances comes into play here we are speaking of these players after they have made it and remember we are still talking about a minority of a minority we are moving into the area of human relations now because we are involved with the relationship between black and white in the united states more particularly we are dealing with the hidden emotional dialogue that passes back and forth between them below the surface behind the spoken word at the root of the difficulty is the white mans beliefwhy is this so difficult to shakethat the negro should be grateful for being allowed to play in the big leagues the same quality that the fans most admired in eddie stanky his combativeness was the very quality they criticized in jackie robinson it was as if they were saying whats the matter doesnt he appreciate the chance were giving himwhich could only mean that they did not really believe he was as entitled to that chance as the kid next door by the same token i suspect that managers and players will criticize a colored player who seems to be lackadaisical far more than they would criticize a white teammate when a colored player loafs he is showing they feel that he does not appreciate what has been done for him which againcan only mean that they still consider him at this hidden emotional level to be something less than equal the negro having developed antennae which are perfectly attuned to that wave length picks it up understands and is not gladdened robinson always reacted to criticism by playing harder but people are different other negroes finding this sort of peripheral prejudice existing at the point where they had thought they had escaped from it react by drawing back into themselves it is more than possible you know that the negro in the ghetto never feels rejected with quite the intensity of the negro who becomes a celebrity in the great unghettoized worldas a bigleague ballplayer let us sayand then finds that all the success in the world does not make him immune from the same old slights and humiliations even here of course human beings react in a multiplicity of ways to find that nothing you can do can change your situation can be a great comfort to some since it means that no further fighting is necessary to others it is the ultimate rejection it was paul robeson the negro who achieved popular acclaim of his time who became the most disaffected of all negroes the white players are aware if only subconsciously that what is really bugging the negro are the conditions that have been imposed upon him as a negro human nature being what it is their reaction is to turn the situation completely around since his moodiness arises out of the fact of his being a negro then it becomes a simple matter for the white player to tell himself that is the natural result of his being a negro sure he thinks to himself all of them are like that it is far more comforting we can all agree to blame him and his race than to blame us and our race so here we go again it is now the negros turn to react a second time to the white teammates reaction to him if a man is made to feel that he is not accepted as a member of the country the community or the team he will come to feel that he is a member of nothing except the negro race and that he owes allegiance to the negro race only this is not an attitude that is going to leave a man brimming over with team pride  the problems of the latin american are somewhat different and probably even more complicated to give you an idea of the problem confronting him do this for me take one of his white teammates away from his home and family put him down in a caribbean village where nobody speaks his language have him eat strange foods which emphasize his foreignness and also upset his stomach have him faced socially in this imaginary village with completely newand bewilderingcustoms which discriminate against him make it perfectly clear to him that he is not considered quite the equal of the natives and that while no offense is intended it would be greatly appreciated if he would be a good fellow and keep his distance he just might feel that he is an outsider he just might not have any flaming loyalty to his team he might even have trouble remembering what his teams name is when he does manage to find the ball park the manager has to pass on all instructions to him in this strange language necessitating a certain amount of sign language and a certain tone of voice that reminds him uncomfortably of the tone that is used toward a particularly backward child it is just possible that he might be uncertain and hesitant and being uncertain and hesitant he might not go about his work with his accustomed snap and vigor he might not even want to if you treat a man like a migratory worker he will act like a migratory worker this is the situation admittedly carried to its extreme that the latinamerican players have been confronted with as they begin to come up to the big leagues in greater number they naturally tend to group together in the clubhouse as well as off the field much in the way american players would group together in puerto rico much in fact as americans have traditionally grouped together within their own cities clubhouse cliques have always been a part of the baseball scene but this is something new this clique speaks in a foreign tongue this is a foreign colony setting itself up in the last american stronghold the baseball clubhouse you see them there chattering away in spanish and every once in a while you are left with the uneasy feeling that these foreigners are talking about you and laughing at you if they want to play here and take home our money you think to yourself why dont they speak english like everybody else if you are half intelligent you dont carry that kind of thinking too far and yet some of the resentment remains enough of it remains at any rate so that when you can find an outlet by criticizing them for something that is obviously true an easier attitude toward their work you are not slow to seize upon it they dont hustle they dont care theyre taking the bread out of my childrens mouths never mind that they are also leading the team in hitting that only makes it worse that only shows how good they could be if they cared there is some truth here too the latin temperament is quite different than the american temperament people who grow up in latinamerican countriesbe they white or coloredhave never been noted for their energy there is first of all that enervating tropical climate which slows down the entire pace of life we dont see ourselves as others see us we dont even begin to appreciate that our whole attitude toward life has been formed by that remarkable institution the american dream which tells us that there is nothing we cannot do nothing we cannot be if we will educate ourselves work hard and think clean thoughts we are a nation of optimists the american player whom we call a hustler is just the standard american gogetter transported to the baseball field we are also a people who think in terms of the longrun because we have been granted the luxury of a stable government we are so sure that the framework that exists today will be there always that it does not even enter our calculations the latin american has no such history of political stability his thinking formed just as unconsciously by his own background is for the shortrun the latinamerican player wants to be successful sure but he does not really think in terms of being a big success the drive to keep pushing himself to rise higher and higher just hasnt been built into the marrow of his bones he is more apt to wonder why these crazy americans dont relax and take a siesta now and then instead of rushing around all the time going nowhere the criticism of the latinamerican player really adds up to the ageold cry theyre not like us and they are not the difference in temperament could hardly be wider in all of these differences and all of these conflicts as they apply to both the negro and the latin american there is one constant they have not a thing to do with basic intelligence there are some people who fear that the negro will soon dominate the major leagues i take this as a compliment to baseball because it shows that everyone understands that ball clubs will play the best men available in every position regardless of colorand regardless of any talk about conflicts of temperament i for one dont think its going to happen i think that as other fields open up for the negro a drainingotf process will set in  besides as the negro becomes more sophisticated more successful more middleclass he will become less physical he will sit at an office desk drive to the corner for his newspaper and be privileged to enjoy the rich food we could all do so nicely without the debilitating process will have begun welcome to the affluent society  
a report  black arts convention
by dudley randall
he first black arts convention sponsored by forum  met in detroit june  at central united church of christ it went beyond the arts for in addition to randall workshops on literature music art and the drama there were workshops on education religion negro history and politics an estimated  persons attended the threeday sessions coming from most of the major cities across the nation stokely carmichael new executive director of sncc was injured in a demonstration and was unable to give the opening address charles p howard took his place and read a message from carmichael which expressed the hope that when one black man gets hurt every black man will move against those who hurt him howard said that the u s propaganda in africa against leaders like nasser sukarno and toure is fantastic he urged negroes to support and sacrifice for our militant leaders we must have nkrumah back he said max stanford said the black male has no power is a faggot the black man can only become a man through a revolution by any means possible he cited atrocities against negroes there should be a program for group action negroes must unite and organize the panel on literature stressed that the black writer should not write for the approval of a white audience but to the needs and aspirations of his people lawrence p neal said this will not be limiting for the range of black experience was broader than the range of western experience and included love wonder excitement rhobena nelson urged that writers know their own history and oliver lagrone and bobb hamilton said they must teach the beauty of blackness harold foster said that writers must open the eyes of the people to the ugliness around them and spur them to action dudley randall said that the seeming disadvantages of black writers were in reality opportunities because since they had less chance of being corrupted or distracted by success they could devote themselves to the solitary labor of writing they should develop their own media and publishing houses    in the panel on religion the view was expressed that god is not dead but only old notions of god and of the singleness of god one member said negroes dont need whiteys theology and ridiculed the stories of the creation and of jesuss birth a speaker from the floor called christianity the most damaging of all religions it broke the people fitted them to be slaves milton henry said we cannot throw out the scriptures especially the old testament even though paul had perverted them with his admonition slaves be obedient to your masters in the workshop on negritude and afroamerican history harold lawrence outlined the contributions of negroes like isaiah mccoy to american technology martha prescott said that history is a tool of culture we can use it not only to set the record straight but to understand the process of deculturization that took place  years ago k william kgositsile a south african said it doesnt matter how much black history you know if you dont use it senegal is still a french colony confrontation of africa with the west is inevitable what will the black artist do to orientate the black psyche it is a question of survival he said leopold senghor initiated negritude because he realized no matter how french the senegalese were to the french the were still niggers the motels hotels and banks are still french the negroes there are like niggers on plantations jackie wilson a member of forum  read a paper on black nationalism that said black essence is still to be born he proposed an institute for africanamerican studies here or in harlem to know this beast and fight him in the halls of the university of chicago harvard and the university of california    in the drama panel david rambeau gave a short history of detroits concept east theater he said they had been not talking but doing at concept east the black actor can learn the elements of acting without the humiliation of being patronized by whites denise nicholas said one of the biggest problems of the free southern theater is material blacks have been writing plays but few have been produced there are few black actors and technicians another problem is the lack of images and symbols for black people most plays deal with one or two whites and the natives except for a few plays by leroi jones and one or two others sylvia king spoke of the need for black writers and producers we need people to invest their money in productions she was baf fled by whether to play negro roles or roles of just any mother wife i doctor or lawyer lawrence p neal asked who we were trying to reach what do we want to say mrs kings individual problems are not important shakespeare the russian and the french dramatists knew they were writing for englishmen russians frenchmen negroes alone have to ask themselves whom they are writing for he criticized rambeau for i producing waiting for godot a play which has nothing at all to do with black people it doesnt matter that youve been not talking but doing it matters what youre doing we need not just a theater of anger and protest but of love spirituality there are plays in the schomburg collection by afroamericans which are out of print and available for production rambeau replied that all have their humanity no one can give it or take it away when you talk about whitey you have lost your humanity when you get into talk about aesthetics you dont get action people starve not from whitey but because you have talked them to death concept east has done the toilet the slave dutchman blues for mr charlie and plays by local authors neal replied that rambeau still hadnt answered why he produced godot he asked who controls concept east who pays costs who selects roles because our people have been lulled into a zombielike state of complacency we need the spectrum of emotions including hate mentioning whitey doesnt lessen humanity we can have a dialogue as brothers and sisters an elderly man in the audience said we dont hate white people we hate hate weve been beat robbed killed in this country and were going to love it if thats love damn it denise nicholas wanted some way to pool resources so ideas could spread across the country neal suggested that concept east the three new york theaters and other theaters form a national black theater and meet on pooling resources    in the workshop on politics grace boggs suggested that citizens organize on small grievances until they could take power a member of the black citizens council of watts made the only derogatory remark about malcolm_x when he said there were three kinds of black nationaliststhe talking kind and he showed a picture of malcolm eloquent and logical but doing nothing the ram kind who are suspicious of everybody and the action kind and he showed a picture of a watts youth saying burn baby burn another speaker said that where the blacks live they should have control leaders should take orders from the black community the party could have any name but should have black officers and be controlled by the black community the prime minister of the harlem peoples parliament in new york said it was the goal of a nation to establish a government therefore they had chosen the yoruba culture and had established a government in harlem he had appointed ministers in fields of their interest and accomplishment the minister of education has set up a curriculum from grade  to grade  if this curriculum is not started in the schools in september they will padlock the schools on liberation day may  they will stop paying rent women will take over the lofts and start light industries sunday novelist john oliver killens delivered the closing address in which he said that the negro was an anglosaxon invention to make black men undeserving of human treatment to deniggerize to rid the world of niggers is the job of the black revolution in this struggle minds are enslaved with words and words must free our minds killens said in this struggle love is irrelevant a master cant love his slave and a slave cant love his master unless he is a fool we must know the profound beauty of broad noses thick lips we must create our own myths our own legends we must consolidate our power in cities and take power places where negroes live dont have to be ghettos we must stop wasting too much ammunition on each other the convention as a whole had the fervency of a religious revival there were the icons of the saints marcus garvey w e b du bois paul robeson malcolm_x there were the shouts of amen tell it brother and applause and standing ovations for malcolm_xs widow and poetry reader val gray the artists musicians and writers were there but conspicuous by their absence were the local leaders except those of the freedom now party yet underneath the fervency there was a certain wistfulness these desires to control their own destiny to produce their own art to defend themselves from attack which kept the local bigwigs away in droves are after all nothing alarming nothing radical these are rights which should be taken for granted without even having to be talked about these plans for political power are the same as those discussed by the republican and the prohibition parties or by jews italians or poles all through the ages all over the world it has been mans right to defend his life and person what made the wistfulness is that it was necessary to have such a convention at all 
the wall
by gloria davis 
lba stood before his father waiting for his answer and clenching his fists hopefully his father bit his full top lip and turned his eyes away avoiding him alba could feel the wall rising between them the wall which always seemed to rise from nowhere suddenly he wanted to cry out but the memory that he was no longer a small boy stopped his tears the dirt which made the floor felt sticky under his bare feet he dropped his hands and walked through the huge hole which made a door onto the rocky pathway the morning air stuck in his nostrils and the cool earth soothed the soles of his hot feet he walked past the rundown shacks until he found a deserted spot he took a deep breath and looked around suddenly he thought about nee her silky skin and flashing smile her thick full lips and broad nose everyone said she was beautiful he had only recently met her but already he had decided that she would be his wife many other boys of the village had wanted her but he had gotten her his chest swelled with pride at the thought nee was not the only reason he wanted to go to the south to work in the mines he wanted nice things and there was no work here that could pay for them he wanted a fine house like he saw in the magazines he wanted rugs so deep that his feet could get lost in them and beautiful furniture he wanted to work a full year before getting married then he would be seventeen he had known that he needed money to go south but he thought it would prove to be no problem he had told his father of his plans  fine good he had said nee will make a good wife and give you many sons he had said fine to everything until he heard about the mines how come you cant stay here and work he had yelled mf j ml m alba had explained the reason to him over and over finally he had given up and left his father to turn the idea over in his head again hoping he would change his mind he had asked two more times but had gotten no reply he couldnt understand it his father had once lived in the south he turned and started home where you been boy his father demanded out he replied you mad at me yeah how come how come you wont gimme no money to go south alba spat how come you dont want me to work in the mines he added yelling alba looked at his father he saw his eyes waver and the wall rise between them again sit and eat the food it is hot now his father said pointing to the table alba pulled a box across the earthmade floor he picked up a chipped dish and dipped stew from the black pot they were eating in silence until his papa said aint you changed your mind yet boy naw alba replied maybe you should talk to nee maybe she could help you change your mind no why not because i am a man and a man needs no woman to help him make important decisions you once told me that it is important for a man to make the decisions why are you changing now im not changing you have yet to become a man you are a small boy with boyish dreams you are a boy who needs help to make important decisions i am a man i have the dreams of a man i do not want to wither and die old like you with nothing alba gestured excitedly eating the same food day in and day out from chipped bowls and black pots he was immediately sorry for the way he had spoken he could see that his father had been hurt by the way his face crumbled if you were a man i would hit you but you are yet a child and you do not know the real treasures of life like a child you let your tongue wag loosely and your words spill freely the old man slowly rose from the table and walked away alba sat at the table and thought about what his father had said still he denied that he was a child and that his words spilled freely and his tongue wagged loosely he knew that he would never get the money from his father he had torn at the wall which stood before him with strong urgent hands he had beat it with forceful fists and kicked it with hot sweating feet but it had not budged it still stood immovable laughing at him for he could never tear it down to see what lay behind it he knew what he would do he would have to work secretly to get the money if he could just work tomorrow he would have almost enough and he could get the rest from nee this would be adequate to get him there he would worry about the rest when the time came with his plan in his mind he moved the chipped bowls off the table and washed them alba strolled out into the next mornings air to look for a job he went from place to place looking hungrily for work finally a man hired him the job paid less than he had hoped but he took it anyway he arose each morning after to go to work returned late in the day and had dinner from the cracked bowls with his father he had made up his mind he now planned on a day of leaving before he left he would go by nees as he did many evenings now but he would say goodbye ? ? e in the middle of dinner that evening his father rose and left the table in a minute he came back and thrust the money on the table howd you get that money steal it alba felt guilty only for a moment naw i worked for it why i needed it so i could go south he saw a shadow creep into his fathers eyes and the wall was between them again but this time the shadow began to fade and the wall began to crumble you say you do not want to wither and die old like me with nothing if you go to the mines you will grow old and die with not even this he waved his hands futilely you will work hard and soon spit blood it is a slow dying you will do boy what of your family will they be like mine my papa worked in the mines too and he soon coughed blood and died he left his sons and wife alone to work he did not have even this he gestured again is it not better to live and have nothing than to work and die with nothing the unanswered question hung in the air the money lay on the table alba went to nees 
my father my bottom my fleas
by ethridge knight
kentucky summer y t ip y was hot and the levee  cut off what little breeze there was the river was down the bottom was closing in on me although i had been feeling him out for a long time i dont think i i i would have ever gotten up enough courage to do it if it had not been for the busted lip bring it out in the opentonight i told myself as i stood in the bathroom silently pressing a cold cloth to my mouth it didnt matter that i had had my mouth busted by him maybe a hundred times before or that i knew such accidents were unavoidable while body punchingespecially when our bodies were slick with sweat and we were caught up in the heat of battle before supper he had come out alongside the backyard fence where i was digging baitworm beginning the ritual he had stripped off his shirt and said wanna go a coupla rounds sport i had dropped my spade and completed the ceremonyas i had done for as long as i can remember yessir a coupla rounds if you want to i stripped off my shirt and we squared off during the workout he got carried away and one of his punches had glanced off my shoulder splitting my lip ignoring his are you hurt sport huh are you hurt i had shaken off the gloves and struck out for the bathroom spitting out blood along the way for awhile he had hung around outside the bathroom door sucking air through his teeth well i would also use his regret to help press my case tonight after supper for a half hour he hunched over my shoulder while i did his weekly bookkeeping in the livingroom it was friday payday and i figured out the hours he had worked the grocery bill the house rent and everything with his overtime and all things were not so bad he slapped me on the back then turned and went in the kitchen where mama and tina my tenyearold sister were doing the dishes he got himself a can of beer and came back in the livingroom easing into his chair by the radio i waited until he had finished listening to gabriel heatter and the news then i walked up to him took a deep breath and plunged in daddy  yeah sport daddy clovis perkins and frank hughes and oliver cobb and fred polk and everybody are going down to take their army physicals monday morning  i couldnt see his face because he leaned over the radio and began twisting the dial i took a step closer and continued ill probably be sent close byto fort knox maybe and ill be able to come home sometimes on weekends    and since ill be seventeen soon anyway you really wouldnt be lying if you signed the papers    and the recruiting officer said    he snapped the radio off and faced me leaning forward he dropped his chin on his chest and stared up at me from under his lumpy scartissued eyebrows i saw two deep furrows cut across his jetblack brow and i got a little nervous then he began slowly weaving his head from side to side as if he were slipping punches and said what you bob talking bout sport sign what weave papers you aint seventeen bob like them others you weave sixteen whered you get this foolishness from you aint going to no bob army this fall you going back to weave school he glared at me for a second then turned back to the radio fingering the dial even though i had expected that bobbingandweaving bit i couldnt help hesitating id seen that same trick send bill collectors scurrying when he was out of work and didnt have money to pay his debts it had worked on tina and me often when wed try to wheedle a buck out of him for a movie or something id seen it work on mama even like when shed jump on him for sitting in the front yard in his undershirt shed usually wind up massaging his shoulders or something but there have been times the trick didnt work like the time mrs woodson a big woman with big big breast who was tinas music teacher came one night to our house and told him that he was going to have to buy a piano for tina that really hit him he shuffled around the living room snorting and shadowboxing like he was in madison square garden the battle raged for hours but he couldnt hold out against the barrage of tears pleas and cutting words loosed by mama mrs woodson and tina i even took their side and got in a few good licks before he finally said okay okay ill see about getting the damn thing tomorrow so i wasnt about to let that bobbing and weaving trick work on me now i folded my arms across my chest and said look daddy i might as well go now in a year or so ill have to go anyway  i mean the war might last til fortyeight or fortyninesome people say  so why wait you gotta stay in school sport wait a little while besides he said softly whos gonna do my figuring for me if you leave that caught me below the belt i turned and walked over to the sofa and flopped on it collecting my composure i knew that he was very proud of and slightly amazed by my ability with numbers many times i remembered in the evenings hed be sitting in the front yard with mr murray one of his old boxing buddies and hed call me out and have me trying to explain algebra and geometry to them i had a notion to ask him whod done his bookkeeping before id learned how but i didnt i decided to compromise well    look daddy suppose i dont go to the army suppose i just go off somewhere and get a job at least for the rest of the summer and ill be back home in time for school just when i thought i had him seeing things my way he suddenly changed styles on me he shifted to mama who with tina had slipped against the wall listening to the whole thing whats the matter with this damn fool boy he said to her he gone crazy you better talk to him i felt cheated and fouled whats she got to do with it i shouted jumping up from the sofa this is between you and me whats so crazy about it anyway you yourself have told me a thousand times that you left home dur mg the first world war and you were only fifteen thats different things was different then they better now he shoved up from his chair strode across the room and began his bobbing and weaving bit again you aint going bob nowheres get it out of your weave head tomorrow im going downtown to that recruiting office and tell the man bob myself i faced him squarely i dont pare what you do im getting out of this stupid place i saw the vein swelling and wiggling like a fishing worm in his temple and i knew that i should shut up but the words popped out of my mouth im not going to stay in this stupid old town and become a stupid old man  i saw the blur his open palm whipped up smacking against my ear i leaped backwards and fell into a crouch with my guard up he took a step toward me his eyes were flaming slits his left hand hung at his side and his right hand was raised above his head he was wide open then i saw his hand swooping down and my mind screamed catchit with your left and countercounter throw your rightyour right but i couldnt move a muscle my chest hurt my ears roared tears welled in my eyes again his hand lifted    from far away i heard mama moan and tina whimper and i moved i slipped under his swing and scooted for the door there i paused fighting down the hurlyburly in my brain and threw what i figured was my toughest look in his direction i think i saw him wipe his eyes with the back of his hand but im not sure i crawled into bed and pulled the covers over my head with my ears ringing with the image of his slitted eyes and uplifted hand dancing behind my eyelids and with the desire to clear out bubbling through my blood i twisted and fretted for hours     the next morning the taste of the fight was still in my mouth and the whirlwind was still in my head for a moment i lay on the twisted sheets soaking in the morning sounds trying to locate daddy in the living room tina was tinkling on the piano from the basement came the slushlunkaslushlunka of mamas washing machine outside a big semitrailer growled down highway  past the back of our house where they coughed and grinded gears for the long pull up and over the ohio river bridge and droned away into illinois not hearing daddys heavy footsteps around the house i guessed that he had gone downtown to pay the saturday billsand to see the recruiting officer groaning inwardly i rolled out of bed washed and dressed i examined my busted lip in the mirror and my chest tightened i wheeled and went into the kitchen where i sat down at the table picked up a cold sweet potato peeled it and bit viciously into the soft yellow meat i heard mama moving around in the basement and i glanced at the basement door in my mind i could see her shoving clothes through the wringer her eyes large and luminous her skin smooth like chocolate with tiny buds of perspiration glistening on the tip of her nose and curling the edges of her hair i half rose to go to her then i sat back down thinking of another time when she had looked at me funnylike and said but sport try to understand hes my man she had aired my mattress that particular day and had found under it certain cheaply printed highly illustrative pamphlets and some peacock prophylactics and when i had come from school the pamphlets and prophylactics were laid neatly wrapped in brown paper in the center of my bed at supper i couldnt meet her eyes but all evening i swaggered around the house prepared for and welcoming an outburst from daddy the outburst never came and when it became obvious that she hadnt told him i felt strangely let down later after asking her why she hadnt told him and after her answering hes my man i felt ashamed and angry i finished eating the sweet potato and stood up looking at the basement door she would be thinking about last night i was ashamed she would think i wanted her to intercede i was angry i picked up another sweet potato and slipped out the back door heading for the river and mr frank clayton paige i climbed the grasscovered levee which separated the river from the bottom the neighborhood where i lived the levee was the community park for the bottom it was here on hot summer eveningsin spite of the stinging mosquitosthat the old folks sat the children played and the guys rambled with the girls catching the cool breeze blowing off the river it was here a few nights ago that i had kissed cathy cathy with the chinese eyes and quick smile i had kissed her and kissed her fumbling with her blouse and she had let my hand rest on her small tense breast i shoved my hands in my pockets and stopped thinking about going past cathys house then i spotted mr frank clayton paige tramping out of his shack he squatted beside the river bank and began to haul in his night lines i trotted down the river side of the levee scrambled through the willows and bushes and in a couple of minutes i was squatting beside mr frank clayton paige he looked over at me and nodded half smiling i nodded back and dragged his doughbucket in front of me keeping quiet i began to roll the soft lumpy dough into smooth balls of doughbait it was hard to tell about mr frank clayton paige sometimes he didnt like to talk early in the morning mr frank clayton paige was a white man with thick hair brown like cured tobacco leaves in the summer it turned reddish like the streaks in the river when the sun went down he was tall almost as tall as daddy but not nearly as thick and he had funny eyes that changed colors like the river did some of the bottom folks said that mr frank clayton paige was rich and that he had lost his wife and children in the flood of  but all i know for sure about him is that after the flood he showed up one day built himself a tarpaper shack on the river bank threw out his lines and commenced to fish he never talked about himself and i for one never asked him the old folks avoided him somewhat but clovis perkins oliver cobb fred polk and i hung around his shack all the time even if he didnt talk much he would always listen to us guys listen with a tiny shine way back in his eyes funny ive seen him look at the river the very same way mr frank clayton paige unhooked the few shimmering fish then he said aint you going to your car wash job today sport uhuh i quit i began to rebait the hooks letting the cold wet lines slide across my palm mr frank clayton paige didnt remark he walked a piece down the bank and threw a line hissing out over the water i called down to him you know clovis perkins and oliver cobb and everybody are going to the army monday dont you yeah they told me i got to my feet and blurted out well  i asked daddy to sign some papers so i could go too and he wouldnt do it and we had a fight and so im gonna leave im going somewhere mr frank clayton paige looked at me and grunted and i felt foolish after a bit he said where you figuring on going i dont know yetmaybe new orleans maybe chicago got any money sixteen dollars umm    aint too much what with the war prices and all nossir but ill make outill make out well he said dismissing the conversation with a shrug lets have a slug of coffee once more i felt foolish and a little disappointed i followed mr frank clayton paige to his shack resolving not to bring the subject up again i drank the coffee silently and afterward with two fishing poles in my hands i walked back to the river the sun was high by now throwing sparkles in the water and spreading a warm blanket everywhere i set out my fishing poles and lazed about on the soft grass gazing up at the patches of cotton floating in the washed blue sky flies and snakedoctors buzzed and flitted around i drowsed a barge carrying scrapiron glided by sending waves laplapping against the bank i slept when i woke the afternoon was deep and i was hungry the sun had fallen behind the bridge which stood humped like the skeleton of a giant dinosaur some of the bottom folks through with their days work were strung out along the bank the mosquitoes and crickets had started their racket and bullbats were darting through the air snapping up gnats i lifted my hooks which had been nibbled clean out of the water and looked around for mr frank clayton paige he was fishing away from the bottom folks on a sandy knoll that jutted out into the river i stood for a moment looking at him then casting off my resolution i leaned the fishing poles against his shack and went over he looked up with that funny shine in his eyes well mr frank clayton paige i said i dont guess ill be seeing you anymore he stuck out his hand gimme a lift i grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet still set on going huh sport he said i nodded yes come on down to the place for a minute he wheeled toward his shack and somewhat reluctantly i followed inside the dim fishy shack mr frank clayton paige rummaged through some cardboard boxes then he straightened up and turned holding in his hand a long wallet like the kind semitrailer drivers carry understand me clear sport he said i think youre wrong in leaving home i think  you had better listen to your daddy but every dogs gotta scratch his own fleas he stuck his hand in the wallet and counted out some bills here take thisin case you might want to come back to your daddy and to your river though i was surprised i didnt argue i took the money and stood like an idiot counting it one hundred dollars mr frank clayton   its okay sport just remember wherever you go to scratch your own fleas i opened my mouth to say something again but he made a shooing motion with his hand his eyes were shining in the dimness and he turned back to the cardboard boxes i threw up my hand at him stepped out of the shack and headed for the levee smiling i had no worries now with a hundred bucks i could go to the north pole i need not even go home for my few clothes i would simply follow the levee on around to town board a bus and be on my way topping the levee i stopped for one final look at the bottom i inspected it i gazed at it with my eyes i devoured it turning it upside down and inside out it rested twisted and listless like a fat snake squeezed between the levee on this side and highway  on the other the frame houses mostly unpainted faced the levee as if they were snubbing the highway and the town beyond black stove pipes jutting crookedly out of the patched tin roofs oozed wisps of smoke from the supper fires and the smoke hovering in the still air formed a haze that was tinted copper by the now dead sun young ones played quietly in the packed dirt yards waiting to be called in to supper but every now and then one of them would send a shriek slicing through the air i could see aunt mandy who used to tell me ghost stories sitting on her front steps over there was clovis perkins leaning his bike against the fence and there was mr buchanan turning off the highway in his old  chevy i tried to spot cathy maybe prancing out to pump some water yonder was florence with her baby poochie whose daddyeverybody said was a white man i tried not to look at our house but when i saw tina shoot out from behind some houses racing toward mrs jacksons i couldnt help but look i didnt see him sitting in the front yard probably hulked in the living room with his ear glued to the radio probably waiting for his coupla rounds sport    no sir not tonight sir thank you sir not ever again    i rose to go beyond the bottom  saw the towns lights glowing in the dusk and i fancied that i could see the blue dog flashing on and off above the bus station then i saw tina again she dashed out of mrs jacksons house and flew down the dusty street she disappeared behind some more houses then reappeared a few minutes later at aunt mandys gate shouting something aunt mandy got up and hurried out the gate toward our house with tina pulling at her hand i saw mama come out on the porch and look toward aunt mandys i turned and took off for town    no sir not tonight sir    so what if mrs jackson did own one of the three telephones in the bottom  and aunt mandy comes to our house all the time    tina is just being silly    i quickened my steps jamming my hands in my pockets feeling the hundred dollars  no sir thank you sir never again sir    so what if mrs jacksons phone is used for emergencies    hes never been sick in his life he stays in shape not an ounce of fat on him    wanna go a coupla rounds sport whos gonna do my figuring i stopped and looked back at our house i could see figures bustling through the rooms but not his big frame all at once i started trotting veering down the bottom side of the levee    no sir thank you sir not tonight sir you got to scratch your own fleas sir and i got to scratch my    from way across the bottom i heard a siren and i felt like upchucking    no sir thank you sir not tonight sir    when i hit level ground i broke into a dead run heading for home 
cotton alley
by pearl crayton
alley aint the x r right kind of name for a stretch where folk live a person hates to tell anybody his address is on a street with that name it just sounds too common most folk who hear the word alley think of something cheap and nobody wants folk to think he lives in a cheap place even if he does a persons got to have some pride somewhere about him but its hard to have any living in a place called cotton alley thats the way we were all of us who lived on cotton alleya bunch of black folk living in a quarter of dingy little shotgun houses far enough away from the better part of town some trying hard to have a little pride and too many not trying at all mister sam was one of those who didnt try and when he did take a notion to he paid a big price for it cotton alley and what we who lived there were to the rest of the world and one policeman got all tangled up together one saturday evening and did something bad to mister samhurt him real bad but hes out of it now it hurt me too and its still hurting me things are better for my people now were free to go anywhere we want to go and do any kind of work were smart enough to do so its best to forget about all the troubles weve been through and work together to do something for our country like president kennedy said we should do anybody with a dimes worth of sense can see that this is the best thing to do aint nobody got any business going around crying about something that happened twentynine years ago yet every now and then that old nightmare memory from those days before the war rise up in my mind and i cry there just aint no sense in me troubling my mind about what happened to mister sam i want to forget lord knows ive tried to forget but i cant mister sam wasnt any kin to me and i didnt care a cent about him he just wasnt the kind of man folk take a liking to every saturday after he got his paycheck hed stop by the honkytonk and drink too much wine then hed come home and fight miss peewee his commonlaw wife and their little girl lucy mae would stand on their porch and cry sometimes when mister sam got the best of miss peewee shed run off up to mister mose johnsons house and call the police theyd come and take mister sam to jail and call up his bossman whod tell them to turn mister sam aloose and in about an hour hed come home and eat supper he was just another one of the bad things we had to put up with on cotton alley all the churchgoing folk kept away from mister sam on account of his drinking and all the sporting folk kept away from him on account of he worked on the garbage truck and didnt ever smell right besides that he couldnt read or write and some folk claimed he had fits there could have been plenty of folk living on cotton alley who liked mister sam but didnt any of them ever show it while i was around i didnt make pretend i liked him either i got a bigger kick out of poking fun at how bad he smelled then one saturday evening came when he stood up in the yard behind the house where he lived swinging an old halfrotten plank at two policemen panting and hollering ah aint gonna let yall hit me on mah head wit dat blackjack again white folk and his bad smell didnt seem funny to me anymore mister sam looked too much all by himself standing there with nothing but that policemans triggerfinger between him and death but the funny thing was that he didnt look any different to me than he had looked every day that id seen him hed always been that much all by himself i just hadnt paid any attention to it until that evening blood was running from a cut on the side of mister sams head getting mixed up with his sweat every now and then hed wipe that side of his face on his shoulder real quick not slowing down the swing of the plank as he did so that was too hot a day for anybody to be getting all worked up like he was doing the sun was going down but it had been so hot all day that the heat of it was still in the ground and in the wood of the houses and in the old tin cans and bottles and slopjars laying around in the back yard all that heat brought out the smell of everything in that back yard that didnt smell goodthe two old toilets that everybody on the block used but nobody cleaned the sloppy place under the water faucet that always dripped the old rusty zinc tubs of garbage with flies singing over them the wet places around the  back doors of the houses where the women threw their dish water the big bunch of folk who were standing around looking at mister sam and the policemen made it seem hotter there were too many of them and they were too quiet everything was too quietwhich made what mister sam and the policemen said sound louder than was natural now you drop that plank boy now you drop that plank right now one policeman was saying in a lazysounding hillbilly drawl holding his pistol on mister sam with one hand and holding out the other hand like he was looking for mister sam to stop swinging the plank and give it to him hed said those same words more times than he had fingers and toes and mister sam was still swinging the plank at him aw mike youre playing with that nigger the other policeman who had come in the black car said come on lets take that plank from this nigger and take him in its getting close to supper time im hungry he was standing off to the side with both hands on his hips looking real sassy his face all frowned up like hed been smelling that back yard too long lucy mae was standing on their back steps crying and calling daddy    daddy    daddy    daddy     calling mister sam like she had something to tell him but he didnt pay any attention to her what happened somebody who came up behind me asked in a whisper sam did some sassy talking to them laws n one of em hit im over th head n he runned back here n started acting a fool someone whispered back i wanted to say that aint the way it happened but when i turned my head and saw that it was miss viney whod done the answering i knew better than dispute her word miss viney was the best shouter at our church a loudly professed soldier in the army of the lord who went around fighting sin right and left and she was overaverage good at bringing punishment upon children who sassed grown folk i held back what i wanted to say but holding it made me feel bad inside now when i remember how it was i wish that i had turned around and said to miss viney i saw the whole thing i was standing by mister sams porch when those policemen came to arrest him and i heard every word they said that policeman standing over there with his hands on his hips called mister sam a nigger and mister sam told him don call me no nigger capn cause ah aint no nigger ise a merican man jes like you is thats all he said and that little old sassylooking policeman hit him over the head with his blackjack looking back i dont see how i could have been so scared of a whipping that i wouldnt speak up for mister sam now you listen to me boy im getting tired of fooling around with you the policeman called mike said in a voice that was too lazy to sound mean he didnt act like he was in a great big hurry to take mister sam to jailmaybe because he knew it wouldnt do any good he had come and arrested mister sam plenty of times before and hed always had to come back and do it again in a couple of weeks boy dont you know that old plank you have there aint no match for this here pistol besides theres two of us you cant whip us both by yourself dont you know that now you stop this foolishness and put that plank down he was trying to talk some sense into mister sams head and maybe wait until his arms got tired from swinging that plank ef ah throw way mah pre teckshun yall gonna beat me up wit dem blackjacks capn mister sam said panting like a tired dog but still swinging the plank ef yall promise me yall aint gonna beat me up wit dem blackjacks ahll put dis plank down it seemed like mister sam wanted to put the plank down but he had went and made a big show of standing up for himself in front of all of us so he didnt want to give in without getting the policemen to give in a little too he must have had a notion to try to pretend he had some pride the policeman called mike didnt answer right off like he was making up his mind about what kind of answer to give mister sam right away i crossed my fingers and closed my eyes and started to wish real hard that hed promise like mister sam asked because mister sam was trying to have a little pride for the first time in his life and he should let him have his pride he was ugly and black and he didnt have much sense but he was an american and an american had a right to have some pride but before i got the wish straight in my mind that little old sassy looking policeman was hollering aw no mike no promises we cant make any promises at all no i opened my eyes and saw him waving his hands and shaking his head like he was trying to head off somebody from walking into a wasp nest i took a quick look at the other policemans face and at mister sams face and they both looked letdown they had their eyes on that little sassy looking policeman didnt either of them seem to know what to do next it seemed to me they were looking for him to tell them and that put him in charge a cold and ugly something moved up behind me id been around it enough before to know that it was just old scared creeping up on me i wanted to walk off so  i wouldnt see what i was scared i was going to see but i stood there and watched mister sam pay the full price for his pride a feeling inside of me held me there an ugly feeling that had come on me a long long time before way back when i first found out that there was more than one color of folk in the world and i was of the color that didnt fare so well the color that all other colors looked down on i had pushed this feeling to the back of my mind because in church our preacher claimed that god loved black folk j as much as he loved white folk and in school our teacher claimed that everybody born in our country were americans and all americans were equal by our countrys laws so all the while i was in church or school i could keep that feeling in the back of my mind but every time i saw a bus driver make a person my color go sit in the back of the bus or i had to drink water from a fountain marked for my color or i had to sit upthesteps in the picture show where everybody my color had to sit or i passed by city park and saw children other colors playing on ground i couldnt walk on and swinging in swings i couldnt touch or i wanted to go any place folk my color werent allowed to go or i heard somebody call a person my color nigger that old feeling rubbed inside of me it was rubbing me then hurting my belief that what my preacher and teacher said was right hurting me all over if we make a promise to this here nigger all these other niggers standing around here are gonna go all over town bragging about how he got the best of us and after that every time one of us go and try to arrest a nigger hell grab up a stick and make us promise him something aw mike you dont know these niggers you give them an inch and theyll take a mile youve got to handle a nigger like hes a nigger and hell stay in his place now you watch me ill show you how to handle a nigger that little old sassy looking policeman started moving towards mister sam real slowly with both his hands held up as high as his shoulders you see i dont have anything in my hands he said to mister sam im coming take that plank away from you then he looked over his shoulder and said to us standing around you all see i dont have anything in my hands now do i do i have anything in my hands he stood dead still waiting for one of us to answer it was plain that he wanted one of us to agree with him so that wed be on his side against mister sam he had all the rest of the world on his side it didnt make sense for him to want us too us and him and his guns and all the world against mister sam was just too much all my insides wanted to holler out somebody ought to be on mister sams side but my throat was too choked up with being scared for the sound to come out my eyes jumped from one face to the other of the folk standing around in the back yards looking for somebody to say something or do something to help mister sam it seemed to me that while that policeman was standing still waiting for one of us to answer him somebody standing around there could say something to mister sam to get him to throw down that plank and save himself maybe all he needed was for one of us to say something to him but i just didnt know who would do the saying my daddy was standing over by the corner of our house still dressed in the coveralls he worked in at the sawmill it just happened that when my eyes jumped to him he was looking at me and i thought at him with all my heart and soul say something to help mister sam daddy but either he didnt get it or he got it and didnt know what to say or he was scared to say anything because he dropped his head and got all wrapped up in an old tin can that was laying by his foot he kicked it and watched it roll off to the edge of the grass then he kicked what maybe was a rock on the ground maybe it was just the ground he kicked he didnt look  at me anymore right then i knew that i needed to be all grown up so that i could say something to make that policeman understand that mister sam was an american man just like hed m told him he was and he had a right to stand up and tell folk to not call him a nigger because he was an american man i needed to be grown up so that i could do something to stop the bad thing i was scared was going to happen so that i could help myself hold on to believing that mister sam and all of us black folk were americans because that was all the pride i had do i have anything in my hands the policeman was asking no suh you shore dont miss vineys voice came from behind me everybody turned and looked at her with the kind of looks that went with cussing but didnt anybody say anything my hands went into fists all by themselves but i knew that i couldnt let them hit her very slowly i made my fingers uncurl holding back being mad hurting my insides holding it back all right nigger im coming to take that plank from you with my bare hands the policeman said moving slowly towards mister sam again you can act a fool and hit me if you want to if youre fool enough to hit a policeman youre the biggest fool in town don come up on me capn mister sam said backing back so scared his eyes were bucked as big as saucers don come up on me ah say the policeman reached out his hand real quick to grab the plank and it hit his hand he jumped clean off the ground and hollered like hed been shot grabbing the hit hand with his other one and shaking them above his head he  really clowned for a while he hollered so loud that i could hardly hear the shot from the other policemans pistol mister sam was laying on the ground with his head in the sloppy place under the water faucet and his feet kicking up dust then all of a sudden he was too still the policeman called mike went to him and squatted beside him he took mister sams hand in his and held it for a long time feeling on his wrist then he laid one of his ears on mister sams chest and let it lay there for a long time listening he raised his hand for us to be quiet even though nobody was saying anythingwasnt either one of us hardly breathing he turned his head and laid his other ear on mister sams chest and listened so long that i wanted to holler cant you see hes dead after a while he looked up at all of us standing around turning his head slowly from one side to the other looking at us all his breath moving his chest coming out of him his face looking like hed come upon something he didnt want to believe and he was looking for somebody to tell him it wasnt so then his eyes got to lucy mae and he couldnt turn them away she was still standing on their back steps crying and calling mister sam calling his name louder and faster daddy daddy daddy daddy screaming his name somebody went to lucy mae and took her inside the house and got her quieted down but i could still hear her crying the sound of me everytime i pass by a street it was too sad for me i ran away named alley and see a bunch of from that sound but it followed me folk my color living in dingy little i had run a long long ways before houses not fit for poodles i can it came to me that the sound was see mister sam again buying a litcoming from inside of me it was tie pride with his life and i just my own crying its still inside of cant keep from crying
