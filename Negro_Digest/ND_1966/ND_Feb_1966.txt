pioneer negro historians
by john hope franklin
very generation writes its own history any nationor any peopleis as sensitive about its past as it is about its future nothing reflects so much the way it will approach the future as does the way of looking at the past the changes that each generation experiences provide new ways of looking at the past nothing better illustrates the way that experience guides the writing of history than the manner in which the history of the negro has been viewed and written  during the slave period when the great majority of white americans regarded slavery as the natural and desirable lot of the negro those who wrote about the negro assumed that he had no history in this country that was worth mentioning when the negro was mentioned at all the statements were as likely as not to be inaccurate or simply not true such historians invariably white usually treated the negro with a silence that was itself eloquent in its assumption that the negro had no history even their discussion of slavery was viewed not as a part of the negros history but as a part of the labor system of the white man and it was full of errors the early histories tell of the arrival of the first slaves in  but the record shows that the twenty  negroes who landed in jamestown in  were not slaves but were indentured servants many of whom were virginia freeholders within a few years these historians make no mention at all of the stern resistance that negroes put up against slavery all during the colonial period or of the thousands who served in the continental armyafter george washington finally permitted them to enlist during the american revolution not only did the white historians assume that the negro had no history worth noting but also that there were no negroes who could possibly argue otherwise it came as something of a shock therefore to discovereven during the period of slaverythat there were negroes who began to write the history of their people one of these was james w c pennington a runaway slave who after he was twentyone years of age learned to read and write he became so distinguished in latin greek german and theology that the university of heidelberg germany recognized his achievements by conferring on him the honorary degree of doctor of divinity pennington did not write a great book he could hardly have been expected to do so but with the appearance in  of his work a text book of the origin and history of the colored people one can say that negro history was launched its significance lies in the fact that it appeared at a time when white americans were giving serious attention to the history of their country but no white historiannot even the great george bancroftgave more than slight attention to the almost three million negroes that constituted sixteen per cent of the population at that time when the slavery controversy was at its heightin the decade before the civil warone of the most widely used arguments supporting slavery was that negroes were so inferior that they had contributed nothing to the development of the country william c nell a bostonbom free negro was outraged by such fallacies and was determined to set the record straight in  after years of labor he published his work entitled the services of colored americans in the wars of  and  in  a revised and enlarged edition appeared nell reminded americans of the role that the fugitive slave crispus attucks played in the socalled boston massacre he told of peter salem and salem poor two brave negroes at bunker hill and he had much to say about the  other negroes who fought in the american revolution it was about this time that martin r delany a graduate of the harvard medical school turned from his professional duties long enough to write a work that surveyed the history of the negro since his arrival in the new world and described the condition of negroes at the time of the writing negroes were taking to the writing of history and biography in increasing numbers after frederick douglass narrative of his life appeared in  other runaway slaves wrote of their own experiences the world learned much of the history of american negro slavery from the pens of the black participants it was a strange thing wonder of wonders that even after the civil war the white historians memory was incredibly short when he discussed matters touching on the history of the negro thus one wrote the following in a book that was widely read in the years after world war  the american negroes are the only people in the history of the world    who ever became free without any effort of their own they had not started the civil war nor ended it they twanged banjos around railroad stations sang melodious spirituals and believed that some yankee would soon come along and give each of them forty acres and a mule the writer ignored of course the continuous and systematic resistance to slavery in which many slaves were involved even more important he ignored the categorical statement of president lincoln that the use of negro troops  of themconstituted the heaviest blow yet dealt the rebellion small wonder that negroes began to give more attention to their history  in the years after the civil war negroes saw their position being attacked not only by the ku klux klan and similar terrorists but also by those who were chronicling the events of civil war and reconstruction they knew that they had no chance of getting their story into the works of the widely read white historians of the period and that is one good reason why they began in earnest to write their own history william wells brown already a distinguished novelist and dramatist with a heroic past as a leading negro abolitionist turned to the writing of history his principal work in history was the rising son which appeared in  he pointed out the difficulty of securing authentic materials but he asserted that he had throughout endeavored to give a faithful account of their people and their customs without concealing their faults brown was merely the first of a considerable number of negroes who in the reconstruction and postreconstruction years wrote about the history of their people there were william still who wrote the underground railroad an exciting account of an activity in which the author had participated and joseph t wilson a veteran of the civil war who told of the exploits of negro soldiers in a book with the colorful title the black phalanx the most outstanding member of the group and indeed the most important negro historian of the nineteenth century was george washington williams although a young man of thirty when he began writing his monumental history of the negro race in america williams had seen a great deal he had served in the united states army during the civil war had graduated from a theological seminary had studied law and passed the ohio bar and had become the first negro to be elected to the ohio legislature i became convinced williams said that a history of the colored people in america was required    because such a history would give the world more correct ideas about the colored people and incite the latter to greater efforts in the struggle of citizenship and manhood when his twovolume work appeared in  it was immediately recognized as the most ambitious work ever undertaken by an american negro williams took nearly a thousand pages to tell the story and the very size of the work astounded americans who had thought that the history of the negro could be told in a page or two within a few years williams was hard at work on his history of the negro troops in the rebellion which appeared in  he did exhaustive research in all the records then available and he produced a work that left no doubt in the minds of any who were willing to read it that lincolns praise of the negro troops was fully justified williams was writing during those postreconstruction years when the status of the negro in the united states was steadily deteriorating in the year that his history of the negro people appeared the united states supreme court declared unconstitutional the civil_rights act of  three years after his book on negro soldiers appeared the mississippi constitutional convention wrote into its organic law suffrage provisions that effectively disfranchised negroes soon south carolina louisiana north carolina and the other southern states followed in  the supreme court gave its blessing to the doctrine of separate but equal meanwhile an incredible number of white americansintellectuals literary figures public servantswere engaged in a fullscale attempt to justify segregation and discrimination by arguing that the negro was totally unfit for citizenship as professor rayford logan has shown in his book the betrayal of the negro the most respectable and respected journals described negroes as superstitious stupid imitative ignorant happygolucky improvident lazy immoral and criminal in the face of such studied insults and such deliberate efforts to keep negroes in their place what were negroes to do during the s and s they despaired as much from the libels against them as they did from the laws that segregated them but they were not daunted they fought segregation and discrimination in the courts and in the legislatures they fought the libels with words as well as deeds negroes argued in a veritable flood of books that they were entitled to their rights because through the years they had earned them w h crogman of clark college deserted his classical studies to write a volume entitled the progress of a race he sought almost desperately to prove by an enormous array of facts that negroes had contributed mightily to american life a few years later john w cromwell would attempt to do the same in the negro in american history there were others the best known of whom is booker t washington whose twovolume work the story of the negro appeared in  some of those pioneers wrought well others fell short of the mark few of them had either the intellectual equipment or the training of w e b du bois whose first historical work the suppression of the african slave trade was published in  as the first volume of the harvard historical studies few of them had the imagination or zeal of carter g woodson who founded the association for the study of negro life and history  in  and negro history week a decade later each of them in his own way was seeking to fill a great void in the history of the united states e a johnson the school teacher in raleigh north carolina who later was a member of the new york legislature summed up most adequately what the pioneer negro historian was trying to do in the preface to his a school history of the negro race in america published in  johnson said during my experience of eleven years as a teacher i have often felt that the children of the race ought to study some work that would give them a little information on the many brave deeds and noble characters of their own race i have often observed the sin of omission and commission on the part of white authors most of whom seem to have written exclusively for white children and studiously left out the many creditable deeds of the negro    how must the little colored child feet when he has completed the assigned course of u s history and in it found not one word of credit not one word of favorable comment for even one among the millions of his foreparents who have lived through nearly three centuries of his countrys history the penningtons the johnsons and all the other pioneer negro historians clearly saw what their task was in performing their task they launched an entirely new field of study which has only recently come into its own one of the most cruel things that one could do today would be to forget or ignore pioneers such as these early negro historians one of the most praiseworthy things one could do would be to recognize the enormous importance of their keeping the light of truth flickering until it could be kindled by greater resources and many more hands

eneral nathaniel p banks commander department of the gulf said in referring to their combat behavior it gives me great pleasure to report that they answered every expectation their conduct was heroic no troops could be more determined or more daring banks a union officer who led his forces victoriously at shenandoah valley new orleans and mobile bay was referring to the gallantry and martyrdom of his negro troops of their bravery at millikens bend captain matthew m miller company i commander of the ninth louisiana infantry said so they fought and died defending the cause that we revere they met death coolly bravely nor rashly did they expose themselves but all  were steady and obedient to orders such were some of the praises bestowed upon negro soldiers and sailors who fought in the civil war and they not only fought they fought gallantly sometimes displaying a sheer heroism which when looked upon by the nation in whose name the conflict was called forth naturally caused that nation to seek an unprecedented means of rewarding them that reward was the medal of honor presented to twenty black patriots who distinguished themselves by their courage in action and other soldierlike qualities during the war between the states someone has said he who possesses the medal of honor is the holder of the highest military award for bravery that can be given to any individual in the united states of america this symbol of bronze bestows upon the man who has received it a great privilegethat of sharing in the company of the few heroes who have been honored by the award of the same medal he wears there were  negroes who served in the union army and on union ships during the civil war most were contrabands or slaves who escaped from their masters to the union lines general benjamin f butler made the first effort to deal with them at fort monroe in  he and later general ulysses s grant used the blacks to build roads and fortifications this discriminate use of valuable manpower caused considerable controversy in the north for more than a year the union debated whether the contrabands should be armed and mustered into the army the confederates were already using negroes in their armies louisiana for example had organized the louisiana native guard later known as the first regiment infantry corps dafrique tennessee and south carolina also used negro regiments in the field this prompted certain leaders in the north mayors governors and the like to increase their demands for the employment of negroes as union soldiers in august  black units were organized in rhode island kansas and massachusetts by the time president lincolns emancipation proclamation was issued on september   nearly  negroes were trained and ready for the smoke and din of skirmish and battle along the mississippi the louisiana native guard was the first negro regiment to serve in the union army the blacks were volunteers who fought with the confederates but were treated badly by their white officers to escape this humiliation the negro troops allowed themselves to be cut off by union forces and gladly surrendered general butler then pressed them into service with his forces many of the exslaves eventually found themselves fighting their former masters in a matter of months so many troops had been recruited that on may   a bureau of colored troops headed by adjutant general lorenzo thomas was established in washington d c to handle affairs of the negro units negro soldiers trained and fought on a segregated basis and were not treated as the white infantrymen they experienced discrimination and disadvantages the negro for example received seven dollars a month but whites received thirteen because of this discrimination many of the negro combatants became restive sullen and even insubordinate yet the majority of blacks were less interested in the fact of being treated differently than having the right to fight as free men and prove their courage and devotion perhaps sergeant major christian a fleetwood a medal of honor winner best exemplified the negroes motivation when he said he enlisted to save the country from ruin fleetwood served with the fourth u s colored troops in action at yorktown petersburg new market heights and fort fisher sergeant william h carney of the th massachusetts colored infantry was the first negro of the civil war to earn the medal of honor it was at fort wagner south carolina a point vital to the capture of charleston south carolina that he and his fellow patriots bore one of their severest tests of valor it was july   the weather was perfect union land batteries opened cannon fire from the southside and were joined simultaneously by six ironclads at the same time the negroes began their charge as they felt their way up the steep jagged face of the fort a barrage of hand grenades exploded about them the negroes advanced upward ignoring death a dozen fell simultaneously dead or wounded among them was the color sergeant carrying the national flag before the colors slipped from the relaxing fingers of the wounded bearer sergeant carney sprang forward and seized them in spite of wounds in his legs breast and right arm he led the way to the enemy fortification and raised the colors for half an hour carney lay on the forts outer slope for protection when the union troops were forced to retreat under heavy fire he retrieved the flag when general grant left the west to take command of the union army and direct the fighting on the crucial virginia front he insisted on bringing  negro infantrymen at deep bottom virginia on july   four black regiments the sixth u s colored troops among them fought heroically in one of the fiercest campaigns of the battle for virginia the negro volunteers bore the enemy assault gallantly especially sergeant major thomas hawkins he earned a medal of honor for rescuing the regimental flag during the engagement of the action in which about  blacks died major general d b birney th corps commander said it was one of the most staring and gallant affairs i have ever known sergeant decatur dorsey also earned his medal for saving the colors at petersburg virginia on july   faced by musketry fire in front and a cross fire of shells from the flanks the negro troops charged toward enemy lines some stopping briefly to fire their weapons others taking cover in pits as originally planned dorsey a member of the th u s colored troops surged forward and mounted his colors in confederate territory in advance of his regiment when the unit was driven back to union lines he carried the flags there then bravely rallied the men later the blacks moved over the rebel defenses and engaged the enemy in close combat taking two stands of colors and  prisoners for the only union success of the day while the negro soldier was proving his courage the negro seaman was going ahead in his service to the country most of the union navys  negro sailors were contrabands because there were not enough white men available in the north exslave robert blake was decorated with the navy medal of honor for valiant service as a powder boy aboard the u s steam gunboat marblehead on december   during an engagement with the confederates that christmas day off legareville stono river on johns island seaman blake bravely defended his ship while manning the rifle gun his repeated counterattacks forced the enemy to abandon the island position leaving the caisson and one gun behind of his service blakes commanding officer said he excited my admiration by the cool and brave manner in which he served nearly six months later on june   the uss kearsarge had a daring encounter with the confederate raider alabama off cherbourg france aboard the union gunboat were fifteen negro enlisted men of various ratings among them was seaman joachim pease loader of the no  gun during the bitter engagement which resulted in the sinking of the alabama pease earned a navy medal of honor for his marked coolness good conduct and gallantry in the action acting ships master david h sumner in reporting on peases actions said he fully sustained his reputation as  one of the best men on the ship later john lawson a landsman served aboard the flagship u s s hartford during a skirmish between rebel gunboats and the ram tennessee in mobile bay on august   from the vessels mainstep rear admiral david d farragut directed the union attacks against fort morgan the onetime refugee slave camp lawson suffering from a severe leg wound was thrown violently against the side of the ship when an enemy shell exploded the shell burst in the midst of the sixman crew knocking them to the shell whip floor on the berth deck as soon as lawson regained his composure he returned to his battle station despite repeated pleas from captain percival drayton and others to go below for medical treatment he remained at his post until crewmen of the tennessee had run up the white flag in surrender landsman aaron anderson received the medal for service aboard the u s s wyandank during a boat expedition on march   participating with a boat crew in the clearing of mattox creek anderson carried out his duties in spite of devastating enemy fire which destroyed half the oars pierced the launch in places and cut the barrel off a musket being fired at the enemy negroes earned eleven medals of honor for valiantly and effectively serving with the union army during campaigns at chapins farm virginia on september   private william h barnes of the th u s colored troops although wounded was among the first of his unit to enter rebel territory and rally the union forces during one engagement his medal was awarded on april   for that demonstration of bravery sergeant major fleetwood first sergeant alexander kelly sergeant alfred b hilton and private charles veal were decorated for rescuing the colors during separate encounters with the confederates at chaffins farm fleetwood a member of the fourth u s colored troops seized the colors after two bearers had been shot and carried them nobly during the fight fleetwoods unit lost about  out of less than  men during the battle relating his fellow infantrymens courage he later said the negro stood in the full glare of the greatest armies ever mustered upon this continent competing sidebyside with the bravest and best of lees army losing nothing by comparison when the regimental color bearer fell during another attack at chaffins farm sergeant hilton of the fourth seized the color together with the national standard he then led the charge on enemy lines until he was wounded by rebel fire in an advance near confederate barricades in another charge the colors had fallen first sergeant kelly seized the flag then rallied the men of the sixth u s colored troops amidst confusion and heavy enemy resistance when two other color bearers were shot in another skirmish close to enemy territory private veal seized the national flag then without concern for his own safety he led the fourth u s colored troops through the most dangerous areas of battle though most of the negro units were commanded by whites there were seventyfive negro officers including eight physicians serving in the civil war yet there was no possibility of advancement for enlisted men into the ranks of commissioned officers this fact however did not mean the blacks did not possess leadership qualities they did and it was pointed out at chaffins farm there were cases of enlisted men gallantly leading their men after commanding officers were killed five of these sergeants received medals of honor for such valor on september  one was first sergeant powhatan beaty fifth u s colored troops he took command of company g and gallantly led the men when all the officers were killed or wounded first sergeant james h bronson did the same with the fifths company d as did sergeant major milton m holland with c company and first sergeant robert pinn of company i fifth u s colored troops first sergeant edward ratcliff th u s colored troops took command of company c after the commanding officer had been killed he then gallantly led his men and was the first to enter enemy territory while the battle was raging at chaffins farm on september  the blacks were adding to their laurels at nearby new market heights the key to the rebel flank on the north side of the james river the negroes had advanced at the gray of dawn and forged up the slope surrounding fort harrison the axeman hacked at a barricade made of heavy brush to clear the way when the last enemy fortress was reached the rebels fled under heavy fire without waiting for the union soldiers bayonet charge sergeant james h harris who earned a medal of honor for bravery in the assault and the th swept over the fort and conquered new market road the enemys stronghold five hundred fortythree negroes lay lifeless in a space  yards long after the advance back at chaffins farm the following day september  corporal miles james exemplified the negroes courage as the battle for the farm continued james took his position within thirty yards of enemy territory rebel fire mutilated one of his arms yet he loaded and fired his weapon with one hand in spite of continuous pleas to have the shattered arm treated he urged the men of the th u s colored troops to press the assault near the end of the war colonel thomas wentworth higginson heroic commander of the  rd noted no officer in the regiment now doubts that the key to the successful prosecution of this war lies in the unlimited employment of black troops   instead of leaving their homes and families to fight they are fighting for their homes and families and they show that resolution and sagacity which a personal purpose gives it would have been madness to attempt with the bravest white troops what i have successfully accomplished with the black ones and so it was with the emancipated negro in war between the states twenty of them won the medal of honorthe nations most coveted military decoration of the  medal of honor winners who in over  years pushed their devotion to their country beyond the call of the possible the negro was among them they earned most of their medals while risking death to save a nation which had enslaved them

newer negro history 
by benjamin quarles
the title new er negro history a  reader may ask himself isnt the past like it always was the answer as he already knows is that the past does not cannot changeas omar the tentmaker reminds us the moving finger writes and having writ moves on nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel half a line nor all your tears wash out a word of it but what does change is our understanding of the past our interpretation of it men are always seeking a more meaningful recovery of the past a proper study of history has much to be said for it including its possible influence on the shape of things to come to make the future said carter g woodson the father of negro history it is necessary to remake the past fortunately in the years since woodson lit the torch many other writers have been throwing fresh light on the negro in our history like other aspects of our national life history is now being desegregated old outlooks giving way to new these revisionist viewpoints are numerous this is to be expected inasmuch as the negros roots sink deeply into the american past a brief description of a few of these better known reassessments might serve to suggest their scope and variety no other aspect of negro history is undergoing such a reappraisal as the african background particularly the west coast bulge that comprised the ancestral homelands of the american negro until the recent discovery of historical africa the notion prevailed that when the europeans ventured down the west coast beginning with the portuguese in the s they found the natives living in primitive barbarism and savagery until recent years most people have thought of tropical africa as having been outside the paleits peoples having fallen behind in the march of civilization its cultures as having been static it followed therefore that when the african was brought to the new world he was little more than a brute the belief that black africa has no history had a twofold origin with the coming of the european powers the west coast kingdoms passed into a state of colonialism their histories were not taught indeed it was assumed that no such history existed it being a cardinal premise of colonial rule that the history of the subject people dates from the arrival of the conquerors moreover once determined to exploit africas human resources the europeans men of religion and conscience had to convince themselves of the innate inferiority of  the natives and the worthlessness of their traditions to slave traders and outsiders in general it was comforting to believe that africans were the most backward of all the peoples making up the human family today these outmoded viewpoints of the african past are on the run the work of routing them owes something to the pioneering efforts of w e b dubois who in the s praised africa as the negros greater fatherland from the beginning of a long career as a scholar at his desk and a crusader in the public arena dubois correctly sensed the existence of much scientific knowledge of africa which has never been brought together in  while teaching at atlanta university he made his first attempt to launch an encyclopedia africana an effort he was to undertake for the third time in  then upon the invitation of kwame nkrumah president of ghana dubois was not destined to complete his dream of an encyclopedia he died in  at the age of  but he had left his mark on african scholarship perhaps his most notable disciple was william leo hansberry whose life was changed after reading one of duboiss books the negro published in  this slim volume was like a new planet swimming into hansberrys ken its two hundred and fortytwo pages he wrote were packed with innumerable facts not only about ancient kush and old aethiopia but about a whole series of kingdoms and empires which had flourished elsewhere in black africa in historical antiquity and in the middle ages but of which up to that time i had never read or heard a single word in duboiss pages hansberry read of kingdoms and cultures that as he noted were already hoary with age when hellas was still an infant and rome was yet unborn determined to read the books on africa mentioned by dubois young hansberry went to harvard university which dubois had attended during the cambridge years hansberry immersed himself in the study of the powerful and farranging kingdoms and empires of the west coast in subsequent years he reenforced his knowledge by study at the oriental institute of the university of chicago and by archeological field trips in nine african countries hansberry shared his findings with others both in the classroom as professor of early african history at howard university and through the printed page he is esteemed in the continent whose history he has helped to resurrect in his honor the university of nigeria has established the hansberry college of african studies in  the government of ethiopia named hansberry as the initial recipient of the haile selassie i african research award he died in november  not having quite completed his crowning work a comprehensive history of the lands he loved so well the pioneering work of dubois and hansberry in the rediscovery of the african past was reenforced by that of white scholars foremost among these was melville j herskovits whose myth of the negro past published in  was a landmark in african studies herskovits set out to demolish the argument that the ancestor of the american had been culturally naked when he came to the new world on the contrary said herskovits the negroes of west africa had developed a complex civilization one that embraced advanced political systems operating under codes of law a well organized economic life which in many cases included the use of money and a deeply ingrained artistic urge which was manifest in a profusion so diverse as to include the use of a wide variety of musical instruments an ear for the subtlest rhythm the production of imaginative art in woodcarving bronze and ironwork an evident skill in clothweaving and basketry and a literary impulse that found outlet in tales proverbs and riddles following the lead of herskovits a number of other white researchers turned their attention to the african past in  a group of such scholars organized the african studies association in  another group one of predominantly english membership founded the journal of african history by the early s african history had emerged from obscurity into acceptance as a recognized field of historical study writes philip d curtin in his excellent booklet african history another authority robert i rotberg of harvard in his scholarly book a political history of tropical africa points out that the existence of african history has in recent years achieved widespread recognition many universities in america and europe now offer general and specialized courses in the subject at several levels news media are similarly aware of its respectability    the recent wave of interest in the african way of life past and present has been furthered by the american society of african culture a negro organization founded in  as stated by its president john a davis its purpose is twofold to inform america about the great contribution africans and people of african descent have made to the world of music dance sculpture and painting and to give to the american negro a pride in his originshis heritage across the atlantic and finally on this point african history is destined to become better known because of the work of africans themselves the new ly independent nations of tropical africa are now busy recreating their own pasts the scholars in their new colleges and univeristies will help lay the myth that the peoples of africa were backward and uncivilized before the penetration of the europeans the emergence of african history will do more it should be added than to restore some early missing pages to negro american history african history will prove an antidote to the longstanding neglect of nonwestern cultures it will make necessary a revision of the traditional sequence in studying history a sequence which begins with the fertile crescent and then proceeds successively to greece rome and europe winding up in the united states just as the african background is undergoing restudy so too is another phase of history that had until recently been put to use as a proof of negro inferioritythe reconstruction period this was the tenyear span right after the civil war a period in which negroes sat in congress and in the legislatures of the southern states according to older traditional viewpoints these negro legislators were extravagant corrupt illiterate and incompetent willing pawns in the hands of scheming white politicians this period of republicannegro rule in the south has indeed been difficult to assess accurately the reason lies in the fact that the sources on which the historian must depend are so often shot through with bitter partisanship most of the historians who lived in the america that emerged out of appomattox behaved as though the civil war was a continuing war many northern writers still viewing the former confederates as unreconstructed rebels and most southern writers defending their antebellum viewpoints and thinking of the war as a lost cause which deserved a better fate such onesided views have often been accepted by later generations of writers including historians of note the role of the negro in reconstruction has long needed a saner review until recently many of the standard works on the period have been written by men who believed that the negro was innately inferior a belief which militated against sound judgment being in essence a nineteenth century white south point of view fortunately more and more we are getting a more balanced picture of the negros role in reconstruction the period itself is now being viewed as a time of experimentation rather than as a dreadful decade reconstruction legislatures are now being credited with many important reforms such as establishing free public school systems and making it possible for people without property to vote and hold office the negros participation in politics is now no longer viewed as disastrous the majority of negroes who sat in the state legislatures were honest public servants men who have a genuine interest and a genuine earnestness in the business of the assembly as eyewitness james s pike wrote concerning the ninetyfour negroes who sat in the south carolina legislature similarly the socalled carpetbaggers the whites who were allied with negroes during reconstruction are now being viewed more favorably these carpetbaggers have generally carried a bad name originally given to them by those who disliked equality for the negro what better way to discredit negro voting than by attacking its supporters and so carpetbaggers were charged with being adventurers whose only interest was in making a fast dollar at the expense of the stricken south recent scholarship however has made it more and more apparent that many carpetbaggers school teachers ministers businessmen and public officialswere people of good will who were anxious to build a better south for white and black alike the old stereotype of the dishonest yankee carpetbagger has been challenged again in otto h olsens recent biography of albion w tourgee able judge of the north carolina superior court and author of a fools errand a novel of reconciliation the two decades following reconstruction were low points for the negro who had been shorn of the ballot and whose civil_rights had been whittled down by supreme court decisions but oddly enough it was not until the turn of the century that segregation laws took a sharp rise c vann woodward in his book strange career of jim crow points out that most of the segregation statutes of the south dated not from the s as might be expected but rather from the late s this was the case in many southern communities mary white ovington writing of her visit to atlanta in  spoke of the refusal of dr william h crogman of clark to accept the new city statute that demanded segregation he would not enter an atlanta street car at first he had a horse and buggy but when the college could no longer afford this he walked and it was no short walk to the city woodward shows that the souths racial practices were shaped by segregation statutes he thus refutes anew the argument that the law is powerless to change attitudes and behavior in the field of race relations and that any desirable change must be brought about through the efforts of voluntary groups and agencies exercising patient understanding and using the techniques of friendly persuasion those who assert that legal measures are not the answer to problems of racial adjustment would be amazed to discover the extent to which such legal measures have been used to fix and delimit the status of the negro throughout our countrys history  the newer negro history has many aspects but their central theme and their total impact may be summed up in the phrase the negro belongs in a historical sense of course the negro has never completely escaped the attention of the historical guild but generally he has been thought of as a source of labor or as a source of problems he has been viewed as among us yet not of us an enclave in the body politic but the overwhelming majority of negroes have never thought of themselves as aliens as a separatist group frederick douglass the most prominent negro of the nineteenth century asserted that it was better to be a part of the whole than to be the whole of a part we are americans he wrote and as americans we would speak to americans gunner myrdal has termed the negro an exaggerated american in the sense that his americanism does not stop at  per cent indeed it has been because of this sentiment that negroes have been so critical of their country and so discontented with some of its practices because of their americanism negroes have taken the declaration of independence at its face value because of their americanism negroes have measured their living standards and their opportunities in terms of the american experience not by the yardstick of some other lands or some other peoples this identificationwithamerica sentiment is not hard to explain the negros roots are deep in our history here before the mayflower he is in truth an old american as such he has been a contributor to the making of america he came with the earliest discoverers and explorers negroes provided as much of the heritage of the american continent as any other group writes anthropologist paul bohannan the economy of the antebellum south its production of tobacco sugar rice and cotton rested on negro labor the negro fought in all of americas wars he took part in the westward movement a story only now becoming known negroes were on every mining frontier from california in  to the end of the gold rush in the black hills of dakota writes w sherman savage the negro has consistently stood for democracy and equality the extension of civil liberties in our land owes much to him the cultural patterns he brought from his ancestral homelands have left their design on the broad american fabric the south has unconsciously absorbed the gift of his folktemperament his humor sentiment and imagination wrote a a schomburg the negro bibliophile similarly in the negro in american culture margaret just butcher points out and proceeds to prove that some of the most characteristic features of american culture are derivatives of the folk life and spirit of this darker tenth of the population as colored americans come to know something of the newer updated negro history they can better appreciate their long and close identification with the land of their birth but almost paradoxically in the process of learning this lesson they have also become aware of their own uniqueness today the informed negro no longer denies his past or his color for he is aware of the pluralistic manysided nature of his countrys culture america is woven of many strands writes ralph ellison in the invisible man our fate is to become one and yet many this is not prophecy but description 
remembering denmark vesey
by sterling stuckey
n  a slave named denmark vesey won a lottery and purchased his freedom from his master twentytwo years later in charleston south carolina he was arrested interrogated and sent to the gallows for having led a conspiracy against slavery involving thousands of slaves inspired by the vesey example black abolitionists used it on a number of occasions to exhort the slaves to sunder their bonds henry highland garnett in an address in  at buffalo new york called for a rebellion on the part of slaves reminding them that denmark vesey had shaken the whole empire of slavery later during the civil war frederick douglass urged the slaves to take up arms to remember denmark vesey of charleston moreover civil_rights partisans invoked the spirit of vesey on numerous occasions in the latter part of the th century to strengthen the will of their followers in face of fierce overwhelming odds since the death of vesey chroniclers of the slave era have referred to his conspiracy as one of the most extensive and ingeniously planned of all slave plots and its validity has been attested by contemporaries and historians alike indeed there was general agreement on the existence of a fullscale plot by vesey until richard c wade of the university of chicago raised serious questions regarding the entire incident and called for reconsideration professor wade has advanced the view that there is persuasive evidence that no conspiracy in fact existed that at the most it was a vague and unformulated plan in the minds or on the tongues of a few colored townsmen wade in a recently published book slavery in the cities again challenged the veracity of the usual historical accounts of the conspiracy asserting that the plot was probably never more than loose talk by aggrieved and embittered men some of the details concerning the events which threw the city of charleston into a state of great unrest during the summer of  are likely to remain forever clothed in obscurity nevertheless a reconstruction of the broad outline of developments which caused the defenders of slavery to seek certain retribution against scores of slaves is possible by recounting those developments as viewed for more than a century by those who have studied the vesey incident we hope to provide a historical screen against which wades charges can be projected for purposes of more meaningful scrutiny on may   devany the slave of john c prioleau was standing alongside the fitzsimmons fish wharf in charleston gazing out to sea he was accosted by william paul the slave of messrs j and d paul the pauls slave drew devany into conversation asking him if he knew that something serious was about to happen devany answering that he did not was told that the slaves were determined to do something about their condition to rise up against slavery in great numbers in order to right themselves devany frightened by this startling disclosure carried the intelligence to his master which precipitated the arrest of paul other slaves peter poyas and mingo harthwere later implicated by paul who had begun to fear for his life but poyas and harth displayed such coolness when questioned that they were released william paul however was placed in solitary confinement within a week he divulged more names stated that the plot was one of extensive proportions and that its object was the massacre of whites but at least one of the men ned bennett immediately came forth of his own volition and asked to be questioned if he was suspected a move which served to perplex the authorities more than ever especially since bennett was the governors slave vesey was not idle while these proceedings were taking place upon the arrest of peter poyas john lofton has written veseyfearing that the plan would be frustrated if its execution were delayed until july  as originally scheduledhad advanced the date to june  meanwhile a white resident of charleston major john wilson having heard about the plot enlisted the aid of one of his mothers slaves a blacksmith prominent in negro church affairs george wilson on friday june   startling information was revealed to the blacksmith by a member of his church class he was told that not a moment should be lost informing the authorities since the outbreak was scheduled to begin at midnight on sunday june  george wilson dutifully reported this information to the major notified of this new development the authorities moved with dispatch governor thomas bennett began to shore up the military resources of the city by ordering the quartermaster general of militia to place in the citys arsenal  ball cartridges and to prepare  muskets for delivery john hope franklin referring to the state of panic toward which charleston was moving at this time has observed all kinds of military groups were called into service a person unfamiliar with the problem doubtless would have thought that such extentive mobilization was for the purpose of meeting some foreign foe the neck rangers the charleston riflemen the light infantry and the corps of hussars were some of the established military groups called up a special city guard of one hundred and fifty troops was provided for charleston only the authorities and those involved in the plot knew that a rebellion was scheduled to take place within two days the whole was concealed said the governor until the time came but secret preparations were made saturday night and sunday morning passed without demonstrations doubts were excited and counter orders were issued for diminishing the guard due to the unusual activity among the militia it was borne in upon vesey and his coconspirators that the defenders of slavery had been forewarned that theyvesey and his followerscould no longer expect to avail themselves of the element of surprise though twenty or thirty of his country followers reached the city on sunday morning june  vesey still clinging to the hope that he could lead them in an uprising ordered them to disperse and wait for further orders as if to reinforce his leaders hope bacchus the slave of benjamin hamet brought to veseys houseon sunday nighta sword as well as a pistol which he had stolen from his master rumors of the projected uprising had by this time already reached the citizenry as lofton stated in his book there was great excitement among the whites that evening the streets were filled until a late hour with persons who were uncertain whether it was safe to retire even children were allowed to remain up at the appointed hour of  p m the extra military units took up their stations although their size had been ordered reduced somewhat as a result of the noticeable lack of activity among the slaves a night of sleepless anxiety in the white community followed the sixteenth of june passed on the eighteenth ten suspicious slaves were arrested a development which sounded the plots deathknell for the investigation soon revealed a free negro named denmark vesey as the leader of the enterpriseamong his chief coadjutors being that innocent peter and that unsuspecting mingo who had been examined and discharged nearly three weeks before as quoted from travelers and outlaws as tension mounted vesey who had managed to elude his pursuers for three days was arrested and brought to trial on june  the day following his arrest less than two weeks later he and five other negroes were taken to the edge of the city the trap door was sprung and the bodies of the six were left suspended over the gallows wade writes the uprising now seemed quashed but as word of it spread in the city public shock turned into hysteria no master could be sure his bondsmen were not involved whites who owned no slaves had little more assurance every negro became a possible enemy indeed assassin every action by a black could be construed as a prelude to violence since slaves lived in the same yard with their masters it was not even possible to lock out the intruder  considering the details of the original plot as disclosed by witnesses as the trials proceeded it is small wonder that passions were roused to the point of hysteria lofton basing his account of the conspirators original plans on the evidence as recorded and believed by the court has described the dark stratagems of vesey and his men some  slaves drawn from the countryside as well as the city were simultaneously to march at midnightarmed with pikes daggers swords bayonets scythes and a few pistolsupon the u s arsenal the governors mansion the main guardhouse and a number of other points of the city they were then to fire the city and liquidate not only whites but those blacks who did not join no oneneither children nor women nor ministers of the gospelwould be spared from late june until the th of july over  cases were heard by the court the number arrested h m henry has recorded was   of whom were convicted the number executed was  all slaves except vesey number deported  among the leaders brought to trial only onemonday gelladmitted involvement in a conspiracy against slavery the other principals maintained that they were innocent throughout july slaves were being executed on one occasion twentytwo were executed at once left dangling above the long gallows in full view of the populace the relatives of those hanged were not even allowed to bury their dead as the authorities regarded the bodies of slaves even in death as property on request the bodies of the executed men were turned over to surgeons for purposes of dissection according to lofton in insurrection in south carolina the vengeance of the slavocracy with this singular act had all but spent itself though a few more hangings followed in its wake in late summer the cry went up for the banishment of all free negroes from the state the deed had been done it remained for posterity to interpret it the above account of the vesey plot is representative of the views of the great majority of scholars who have described the insurrection indeed until recently the scope and existence of the plot have gone unquestioned even ulrich b phillips who was quick to seize upon the alleged submissive nature of the slave and turn such an attribute against the negros claim to full manhood rights never questioned the existence of the plot asserting that the vesey plot was elaborate phillips further remarks in a chapter entitled slave crimes that the conspiracy is one of the most notable of such episodes on record herbert aptheker characterizes the incident as one of the most serious widespread and carefully planned conspiracies in addition he describes vesey as a master of several languages who couched his appeals to the rights of man in both theological and secular terms louis filler observes that the vesey insurrection horrified southerners by its scope the audacity of its leaders and the close relationship it revealed between slave and free negroes and kenneth stampp refers to veseys vast conspiracy which came to nothing after it was given away by a slave  this brings us back to professor wades analysis of the conspiracy which led him to conclude that no such fullscale plot in fact took place that at the most it was a vague unformulated plan in the minds or on the tongues of a few colored townsmenitalics added wades reconsideration of the vesey plot must on any showing be taken seriously for it raises serious questions with regard to all preceding interpretations of the plot wade contends that essential facts about the vesey uprising that have been generally accepted by historians are open to question because historians have relied on an official version published by the city in which provided the only available facts facts which in his view do not square with the original account of the case moreover he argues that a close reading of the two versions will show that the original transcript was doctored and that historians generally have focused on the broader meaning of the conspiracy as it related to resistance of negroes to the institution of slavery wade in questioning the existence of the plot relies to a considerable extent on letters written by a respected judge who raised questions concerning the effects of popular excitement upon the trials and letters written by the daughter of the judge whose mood ranged from frenzy to skepticism from great certitude concerning the enormity of the plot to concern over the lengths to which the court had gone in punishing the accused the daughter ann hayes johnson remarked at one point as quoted by wade that south carolinians were possessed of impetuosity and ardency of feeling which unavoidably lays them open to deception and consequently leads them on to error in action but wade does not assert that either judge johnson or his daughter denied the existence of a plot rather he suggests that they were concerned over procedures followed and punishment exacted alluding to doubts expressed by governor thomas bennett wade challenges the published record of the trial at a number of important points though he admits that the governor probably believed in a plot of some kind wade quotes at length from the governors message given to the senate and house of representatives of the state of south carolina on november   pointing out that the governor questioned the secrecy surrounding the trial the method of gathering testimony by the judges the reliability of testimony concerning the nature of the plot the disparity between the enormous scope of the plot and the meager resources of the rebels and the belief that the leaders of the plot were acting in  concert  in examining the points raised by the governor wade questions the involvement of an alleged  conspirators basing his doubt on the fact that no roster of names ever turned up since the plot supposedly involved slaves within a radius of  to  miles of charleston he remarks that the lack of activity in the rural sections cast doubt on the extensiveness of the conspiracy wade draws attention to ambiguities in the official record with respect to the matter of weapons and makes much of the fact that no cache of arms was found he points out that the confessions of two of the accused were edited in the published version of the trials which served to change the tone of the narrative in the same vein he cites the fact that the published account of the trial includes mention of a rebellion not even referred to in the original transcript in wades opinion the discrepancies seem deliberate since the printed version alleges that no facts would be suppressed and that the very words of the witnesses would be used the burden of wades argument then is that the authenticity of the printed version of the trial is in doubt that it contains enough questionable material to support the view that the object of the trial was not to discover the extent of the plot but rather to awe the negroes by a show of force the very atmosphere itself so charged with tension born of rumors emanating from both sides of the color line was especially congenial to a racial explosion when devany and william paul had their chance encounter on the wharf that day in late may the catalytic agent was introduced thus wade remarks charleston stumbled into tragedy how does wade account for the tenacity of the myth of vesey conspiring to lead thousands of alarms in a assault against the slavocracy opponents and apologists of slavery have since used the vesey incident he informs us as part of the ammunition of their respective arsenals either the incident was used as eloquent proof that the will to freedom is so natural a part of the human personality that none would remain passively enchained or as justification for the stringent laws against negroes during slavery no closer examination of the events of that sultry summer in  seemed warranted since scholars were in argreement that the revolt had taken place the vesey uprising had become a convenient illustration of a larger view of bondage richard wade considers it of great moment that the leaders of the insurrection had little or no plan of action and with one exception proclaimed their innocence to the very end one is forced to wonder whether conspirators if involved in an expansive plot can reasonably be expected to admit guilt particularly as long as all of the leaders have not been detected and arrested higginson takes notice of the fact that the transcripts contain an admission on the part of the judges that they were unable to detect more than a small minority of those concerned in the conspiracy could it be that the vesey insurrectionists to the extent that they were successful in mounting a large conspiracy owed their success to iron discipline and to a vow not to reveal important information to the authorities higginson who spent weeks poring over the official reports in charleston offers a different view from that of professor wade as regards both the plan and the refusal of the men who designed it to declare themselves a party to the plot the details of the plan higginson writes were not rashly committed to the mass of the confederates they were known only to a few and were finally to be announced only after the evening prayer meetings on the appointed sunday vesey showed great penetration says lofton and sound judgment in the selection of his leaders the small number convicted in comparison to the number of negroes reported to be involved seems to have been due to a determination on the part of the leaders to meet their fate without talking portions of the official reports not cited by wade perhaps go far toward explaining the refusal of most of the leaders to enter a plea of guilty rolla is described as a man who was remarkable for great presence and composure of mind one who exhibited no signs of fear ned was stern and immovable even when receiving the sentence of death in peters countenance were strongly marked disappointed ambition revenge indignation and an anxiety to know how far the discoveries had extended  italics added to quote higginson he is said to have responded with a cryptic smile when asked whether he really wanted to see his kindly master murdered vesey addressed witnesses in an imperious manner and argued his case with great art and plausibility wades charge that the reports fail to mention the discovery of a large cache of arms however must be reckoned with by those historians who assume that the arms had either been fashioned or secured for use higginson takes a different view of governor bennetts attitude toward the court proceedings than that taken by wade who relies heavily on the governors charge of excessive punishment and contends that the governor probably did not take the description of the plot provided by the city very seriously  higginson offers the view that the governors attitude was colored by a desire to smooth the thing over for the credit and safety of the city he contrasts the governors evasive tone with the frank and thorough statements of the judges if a few people like the governor doubted the enormity of the plot higginson avers the judges seem to admit that had the whole thing been brought to a head the slaves generally would have joined in lofton seems to support wades position that the governor was motivated by a sincere concern over the harsh punishment which was meted out to the insurrectionists he does point out that the governor was also concerned about securing the release of his own slaves a most curious feature of professor wades piece on the vesey plot is the scanty information provided concerning the dramatis personae italics added despite the fact that considerable information regarding each leader of the insurrection is available wade in the main fails to incorporate this material into his assessment he does not mention for example the fact that vesey though a fairly prosperous artisan had every reason to hate slavery especially since he had fathered many children by slave mothers considering the fact that the children and their mothers were doomed to a lifetime of slavery it is not difficult to conceive of vesey wanting to war against that institution his temper according to the court was impetuous and domineering in the extreme qualifying him for the despotic rule of which he was ambitious at another point the record reveals that many negroes feared him more than their owners and one of them declared even more than god no ordinary man vesey appears to have been a man possessing charismatic authority most historians who have written at length on the vesey insurrection have recounted much on the life of peter poyas who was said to be veseys chief lieutenant but all wade tells us is that poyas had an excellent reputation and the implicit confidence of his master in addition to being a firstrate artisan at no time does wade come to grips with the incident with which many writers have most often identified poyas his exhortation to the slaves to not open your lips die silent as you shall see me do as quoted in john lofton negro insurrectionist antioch review xviii summer  higginson reports that poyas was said to have a magnetism in his eye of which his confederates stood in great awe if he once got his eye upon a man there was no resisting it it has also been remarked that poyas when on the gallows repeated his charge of secrecy do not open your lips die silent as you shall see me do on another occasion according to a witness poyas was chained to the floor of his cell with another conspirator when the men in authority came to exhort the names of the men conspiring with the two slaves poyas is said to have leaned upon his elbow looked at the man lying beside him urging quietly die like a man and then lay down again it has been observed that he was obeyed but there is no mention of these remarks in the wade piece other members of the upper echelons of leadership were scarcely less impressive the transcript the original and published versions pay tribute to the abilities and disciplined natures of the men selected by vesey to join in the uprising it should not go unremarked that according to the court vesey and his men had been planning the revolt for close to four years before they were betrayed for a small group of embittered and aggrieved men to have kept such a plan a secret for that length of time appears to be an eloquent testament to their extraordinary conspiratorial propensities such men it seems would not be likely to yield easily to pressure wades charge that not a single roster of names was uncovered stands as one not easily answered given the information provided by his article but when vital portions of the transcript not mentioned by wade are quoted and discussed by lofton higginson and others such as detailed information concerning the personalities and activities of leaders of the plotthen even wades charge regarding the roster of names appears to lose some of its force one might reason bearing in mind what is known about poyas vesey and other prominent figures of the incident that as soon as poyas and mingo harth were released from jail after their first arrest all rosters of names were probably destroyed for at that time all of the leaders were still at large still free to dispose of evidence that would most assuredly not only seal their doom but compromise every member of the plot from the city to the countryside since according to the court each leader kept to himself the names of his proselytes the destruction of rosters of names would indeed be a simple act to perform wade in questioning the extensiveness of the plot says that some of the accused when confronted with each other didnt even appear to know each other perhaps the decision among the leaders to prepare and keep their own rosters explains this in addition such a decision on the part of the leaders might indicate that the plot was a large rather than small one wades contention that the published version of the proceedings of the court varied significantly from the original account seems to be unassailable he and thomas hamilton are evidently the only historians to point out this discrepancy wade demonstrates that evidence in the original transcript was suppressed it should be recalled however that the suppression of information concerning slave revolts in the south was not confined to the vesey case alone according to margaret just butchers the negro in american culture accounts of innumerable slave revolts were suppressed as much as possible but wades position here seems to be well taken for the officials appeared to be suppressing portions of the transcript which might weaken the case for a fair trial having taken place additional information found in the published transcript does seem to clear up as he points out certain questionable features of the original there seems to be little question but that there were irregularities in the manner in which the proceedings of the court were conducted but courts in the south during antebellum days and even now were not noted for protecting the rights of negroes especially when the rights to be protected belonged to men allegedly involved in a conspiracy to overthrow slavery herbert aptheker makes it quite clear that south carolina laws were designed to protect the interests of the masters not the rights of their slaves or former slaves  the fundamental principle of all relationships between the slave and society according to antislavery by dumond was that the slave was subject to control but was not entitled to protection italics added thus south carolina was not alone in fashioning laws to govern slaves that were at variance with those used to establish legal relations among whites by not pointing out these characteristic irregularities wade leaves the impression that charleston officials went to extraordinary lengths to frame vesey and those arrested with him which is quite a different thing from being indifferent with regard to the legal rights of the accused it would have been far more instructive had wade placed his discussion of the vesey plot in the broader context of slavery as an institution had he done so it is possibleeven probablethat his case would have been appreciably weakened for just as carolinians were not unique in their handling of slave legal cases neither were they different from others in inflicting upon slaves punishment quite disproportionate to the offense intended or committed the reactions of the proslavery elements in virginia during and following the gabriel and turner revolts certainly were at the very least equal to the harsh behavior of the authorities responsible for the brutal mass hangings of the vesey conspirators according to kenneth stampp it is worth noting as regards the gabriel conspiracy that though there was no question of the guilt of the slaves involved the leaders when arrested behaved in a manner strikingly similar to that of vesey poyas and the other principals of the vesey plot though gabriel and his followers took to the field to battle for their freedom they were willing to reveal little or nothing concerning their plans james monroe then governor of virginia said of gabriel from what he said to me he seemed to have made up his mind to die and to have resolved to say but little on the subject of the conspiracy as quoted by herbert aptheker in american negro slave revolts is it not possible that vesey poyas harth and others associated with vesey were simply using tactics similar to those used by gabriel and his colleagues the authorities as in the vesey case were never able to determine the number of men involved in gabriels conspiracy and there was that same secrecy prior to the revolt among gabriel and his tough band that the authorities have attributed to the men who allegedly conspired to wreck charleston indeed the gabriel plan for revolt was kept with incredible secrecy for quite some time in the view of one high official in virginia given the character of vesey and the men around him especially when considering what happened in virginia in  it is not unlikely that they had conceived and long nourished a plan that went beyond the loose talk stage whether innocent or guilty ordinary men would one would think quake at the thought of facing the gallows considering the racial atmosphere of the antebellum south is it not extraordinary that most of the ring leaders in question behaved as they did displaying levity in some instances scorn in others and no fear throughout the proceedings professor wade closes his discussion of the vesey plot with the observation that the men accused of having led a conspiracy in charleston were not likely prospects for such a scheme this conclusion is based on his theory that slaves in cities being better off than imbruted field hands were not as likely to revolt he wrote this apparent freedom deflected the discontent leading negroes to try to exploit their modest advantages rather than to organize for desperate measures as regards wades above statement together with his contention that a concerted revolt against slavery was actually less likely in a city than in a countryside stanley elkins is in sharp disagreement in slavery a problem in american institutional and intellectual life he writes it is of great interest to note that although the danger of slave revolts like communist conspiracies in our own daywas much overrated by touchy southerners the revolts that actually did occur were in no instance planned by plantation laborers but rather by negroes whose qualities of leadership were developed well outside the full coercions of the plantation authoritysystem gabriel who led the revolt of  was a blacksmith who lived a few miles outside richmond denmark vesey leading spirit of the  plot at charleston was a freed negro artisan who had been born in africa and served several years aboard a slavetrading vessel and nat turner the virginia slave who fomented the massacre of  was a literate preacher of recognized intelligence of the plots that have been convincingly substantiated whether they came to anything or not the majority originated in urban centers italics added it could well be as the experiences of gabriel and turner demonstrate that the greater the amount of freedom extended to sensitive negro victims of oppression the more not less they wanted to shatter all restrictions placed upon them was this true of vesey did he seek to right himself and other negroes by leading a vast conspiracy to these questions thanks to the probing work of wade future historians are not likely to offer the facile answers of historians who preceded them nor are they likely to remember the incident in quite the same way what appears to be no less certain is that the evidence when taken as a whole will probably suggest to them as it has to generations of scholars that denmark vesey did lead a conspiracy in charleston south carolina veseys example must be regarded as one of the most courageous ever to threaten the racist foundation of america in him the anguish of negro people welled up in nearly perfect measure he stands today as he stood yesterday onehundred and fortythree summers ago as an awesome projection of the possibilities for militant action on the part of a people who havefor centuriesbeen made to bow

nostalgia in pigalle

ts as though dizzy giliw lespie and later miles i davis had never come along to say nothing of innovators like thelonious monk and charlie mingus down at the blue note and the other little right bank boites in the vicinity of champs elysees names like eric dolphy and john coltrane are meaningful but the oldtime jazz is mostly memory but up in montmartre where pigalle remains just about what it always was the old sounds are as familiar as the long shadow of scare coeur la cigale is merely a stone s throw from place pigalle where the arab hustlers have gone modern and peddle feelthy motion pictures instead of the postcard kind and you just walk in off the street and there youll find trumpeter jacques read jack butler leading his quintet in rousing rhythm just as he has been doing regularly since  benny waters is there too looking a little like an amiable pullman porter about as american as you can get despite the fact he has been around paris and pigalle as long as jacques has fact is theyve been around together even before world war ii disrupted their lives and sent them temporarily back to the states benny blows a more than dependable saxophone and clarinet and the music gets marvellous when he and jacques take over for an extended dialogue openly playing for applause jacques other american sidemen long ago deserted for the new sounds back home or for the boites down near the seine and there has been a succession of mostly french antillians guadaloupe martinique on bass piano and drums of course the french dont know the difference since there isnt any geneticallybut jacques knows that only the brothers from the states know where it is in jazz down around st germain theres a group calling themselves the jazz kings jacques says shaking his head in commingled mirth and sadness man theyre africans and you ought to hear the stuff they play it would turn your stomach an extra added attraction at la cigale is jacques longtime amie a comely little blond with a compact figure and twinkling toes two or three times during the evening she puts on a onewoman floorshow doing something that approximates the twist the frug and the watusi it is colorful but the routine is a bit hard on the ladyin more ways than one she is no teenager and her steps owe too much to the charleston well of course theres something highly nostalgic about the whole bit up at la cigale jacques and benny like to talk about the times the late sidney bechet and louis armstrong honored the place in appearances and for this visiting stateside brother benny launched into a special number warning beforehand youre too young to know this one it was by fats waller well i remember the records of fats waller but benny was right this version of squeeze me was astonishingly even before my time the evening was grandly topped off by an allholdsbarred rendition of do you know what it means to miss new orleans and the place was nearly packed when jacques and benny finally laid down their horns you dont hear sounds like that anymore around chicago i told them gee i wonder what happened jacques said 
the hammer man
by toni cade
was glad to hear that manny had fallen off the roof i had put out the tale that i was down with yellow fever but nobody paid me no mind least of all dirty red who stomped right in to announce that manny had fallen off the roof and that i could come out of hiding now my mother dropped what she was doing which was the laundry and got the whole story out of red bad enough you gots to hang around with boys she said but fight with them too and you would pick the craziest one at that manny was supposed to be crazy that was his story to say you were bad put some people off but to say you were crazywell you were officially not to be messed with so that was his story on the other hand after i called him what i called him and said a few choice things about his mother his face did go through some piercing changes and i did kind of wonder if maybe he sure was nuts i didnt wait to find out i got in the wind and then he waited for me on my stoop all day and all night not hardly speaking to the people going in and out and he was there all day saturday with his sister bringing him peanut butter sandwiches and cream sodas he mustve gone to the bathroom right there cause everytime i looked out the kitchen window there he was and sunday too i got to thinking the boy was mad you got no sense of humor thats your trouble i told him he looked up but he didnt say nothing all at once i was real sorry about the whole thing i shouldve settled for hitting off the little girls in the school yard or waiting for frankie to come in so we could raise some kind of hell this way i had to play sick when my mother was around cause my father had already taken away my bb gun and hid it i dont know how they got manny on the roof finally maybe the wakefield kids the ones who keep the pigeons called him up manny was a sucker for sick animals and things like that or maybe frankie got some nasty girls to go up on the roof with him and got manny to join him i dont know anyway the cat walk had lost all its cement and the roof always did kind of slant downward so manny fell off the roof i got over my yellow fever right quick needless to say and ventured outside but by this time i had already told miss rose that crazy manny was after me and miss rose being who she was quite naturally went over to mannys house and said a few harsh words to his mother who being who she was chased miss rose out into the street and they commenced to get with it snatching bottles out of the garbage cans and breaking them on the johnny pumps and stuff like that dirty red didnt have to tell us about this everybody could see and hear all i never figured the garbage cans for an arsenal but miss rose came up with sticks and table legs and things and mannys mother had her share of scissor blades and bicycle chains they got to rolling in the streets and all you could see was pink drawers and fat legs it was something else miss rose is nutty but mannys mothers crazier than manny they were at it a couple of times during my sick spell everyone would congregate on the window sills or the fireescape commenting that it was still much too cold for this kind of nonsense but they watched anyway and then manny fell off the roof and that was that miss rose went back to her dream books and mannys mother went back to her tumbleddown kitchen of dirty clothes and bundles and bundles of rags and children my father got in on it too cause he happened to ask manny one night why he was sitting on the stoop like that every night manny told him right off that he was going to kill me first chance he got quite naturally this made my father a little warm me being his only daughter and planning to become a doctor and take care of him in his old age so he had a few words with manny first and then he got hold of the older brother bernard who was more his size bernard didnt see how any of it was his business or my fathers business so my father got mad and jammed bernards head into the mailbox then my father started getting messages from bernards uncle about where to meet him for a showdown and all my father didnt say a word to my mother all this time just sat around mumbling and picking up the phone and putting it down or grabbing my stickball bat and putting it back he carried on like this for days till i thought i would scream if the yellow fever didnt have me so weak and then manny fell off the roof and my father went back to his beer drinking buddies i was in the school yard pitching pennies with the little boys from the elementary school when my friend violet hits my brand new spaulding over the wall she came running back to tell me that manny was coming down the block i peeked beyond the fence and there he was alright he had his head all wound up like a mummy and his arm in a sling and his leg in a cast it looked phoney to me especially that walking cane i figured dirty red had told me a tale just to get me out there so manny could stomp me and manny was playing it up with costume and all till he could get me what happened to him violets sisters whispered but i was too busy trying to figure out how this act was supposed to work then manny passed real close to the fence and gave me a look you had enough hammer head i yelled just bring your crummy self in this yard and ill pick up where i left off violet was knocked out and the other kids went into a huddle i didnt have to say anything else and when they all pressed me later i just saidyou know that hammer he always carries in his fatigues and theyd all nod waiting for the rest of a long story well i took it away from him and i walked off nonchalantly manny stayed indoors for a long time i almost forgot about him new kids moved into the block and i got all caught up with that and then miss rose finally hit the numbers and started ordering a whole lot of stuff through the mail and we would sit on the curb and watch these weird looking packages being carried in trying to figure out what simpleminded thing she had thrown her money away on when she might just as well wait for the warm weather and throw a block party for all her godchildren after a while a center opened up and my mother said shed increase my allowance if i went and joined because id have to get out of my pants and stay in skirts on account of thats the way things were at the center so i joined and got to thinking about everything else but old hammer head it was a rough place to get along in the center but my mother said that i needed to be bed with and she needed to not be with me so i went and that time i sneaked into the office thats when i really got turned on i looked into one of those notquitewhite folders and saw that i was from a deviant family in a deviant neighborhood i showed my mother the word in the dictionary but she didnt pay me no mind it was my favorite word after that i ran it in the ground till one day my father got the strap just to show how deviant he could get so i gave up trying to improve my vocabulary and i almost gave up my dungarees then one night im walking pass the douglas street park cause i got thrown out of the center for playing pool when i shouldve been sewing even though i had already decided that this was going to be my last fling with boy things and starting tomorrow i was going to fix my hair right and wear skirts all the time just so my mother would stop talking about her gray hairs and miss rose would stop calling me by my brothers name by mistake  so im walking pass the park and theres ole manny on the basketball court perfecting his layups and talking with himself being me i quite naturally walk right up and ask what the hell hes doing playing in the dark and he looks up and all around like the dark had crept up on him when he wasnt looking so i knew right away that hed been out there for a long time with his eyes just going along with the program there was two seconds to go and we were one point behind he said shaking his head and staring at his sneakers like they was somebody and i was in the clear id left the men in the back court and there i was smiling you dig cause it was in the bag they passed the ball and i slid the ball up nice and easy cause there was nothing to worry about and he shook his   head i muffed the goddam shot ball bounced off the rim and    he stared at his hands the game of the season last game and then he ignored me altogether though he wasnt talking to me in the first place he went back to the layups always from the same spot with his arms crooked in the same way over and over i mustve gotten hypnotized cause i probably stood there for at least an hour watching like a fool till i couldnt even see the damn ball much less the basket but l stood there anyway for no reason i know of he never missed but he cursed himself anyway it was torture and then a squad car pulled up and a short cop with hair like one of the marx brothers came out hitching up his pants he looked real hard at me and then at manny what are you two doing hes doing a layup im watching i said with my smart self then the cop just stood there and finally turned to the other one who was just getting out of the car who unlocked the gate the big one said its always unlocked i said then we three just stood there like a bunch of penguins watching manny go at it this on the level the big guy asked tilting his hat back with the thumb the way big guys do in hot weather hey you he said walking over to manny im talking to you he finally grabbed the ball to get mannys attention but that didnt  work manny just stood there with his arms out waiting for the pass so he could save the game he wasnt paying no mind to the cop so quite naturally when the cop slapped him up side his head it was a surprise and when the cop started counting three to go manny had already recovered from the slap and was just ticking off the seconds before the buzzer sounded and all was lost gimme the ball man mannys face was all tightened up and ready to pop did you hear what i said black boy now when somebody says that word i gets warm and crazy or no crazy manny was my brother at that moment and the cop was the enemy you better give him back his ball i said manny dont take no mess from no cops he aint bothering nobody hes gonna be mister basketball when he grows up just trying to get a little practice in before the softball season starts look here sister well run you in too harpo said i damn sure cant be your sister seeing how im a black girl boy i sure will be glad when you run me in so i can tell everybody about that you must think youre in the south mister the big guy screwed his mouth up and let out one of them hardday sighs the parks closed little girl so why dont you and your boyfriend go on home that really got me the little girl was bad enough but that boyfriend was too much but i kept cool mostly because manny looked so pitiful waiting there with his hands in a timeout and there being no one to stop the clock but i kept my cool mostly cause of that hammer in mannys pocket and no telling how frantic things can get what with a bigmouth like me a couple of wise cops and a crazy boy too the gates are open i said real quiet like and this heres a free country so why dont you give him back his ball the big cop did another one of those sighs his specialty i guess and then he bounced the ball to manny who went right into this gliding thing clear up to the backboard damn near like he was some kind of very beautiful bird and then he swooshed that ball in even if there was no net and you couldnt really hear the swoosh something happened to the bones in my chest it was something crazy kids anyhow the one with the wig said and turned to go but the big guy watched manny for a while and i guess something mustve snapped in his head cause all of sudden he was hot for taking manny to jail or court or somewhere and started yelling at him and everything which is a bad thing to do to manny i can tell you and im standing there thinking none of my teachers from kindergarten right on up none of them knew what they were talking about ill be damned if i ever knew one of them rosycheeked cops that smiled and helped you get to school without neither you or your little raggedy dog getting hit by a truck that had a smile on its face too not that i ever believed it i knew dick and jane was full of crap from the get go especially them cops like this dude for example pulling on mannys clothes like that when obviously he had just done about the most beautiful thing a man can do and not be a fag no cop could swoosh without a net look out man was all manny ¥ said but it was the way he pushed the cop that started the real yelling and threats and i thought to myself oh god here i am trying to change my ways and not talk back in school and do like my mother wants but just have this last fling and now thisgetting shot in the stomach and bleeding to death in douglas street park and poor manny getting pistolwhipped by those bastards and what not i could see it all practically crying too and it just wasnt no kind of thing to happen to a small child like me with my confirmation picture in the paper next to my weeping parents and school mates i could feel the blood sticking to my shirt and my eyeballs slipping away and then that confirmation picture again and my mother and her gray hair and miss rose heading for the precinct with a shotgun and my father getting old and feeble with no one to doctor him up and all and i wished manny had fallen off the damn roof and died right then and there and saved me all this aggravation of being killed with him by these cops who surely didnt come out of no fifth grade reader but it didnt happen they just took the ball and manny followed them real quiet like right out of the park into the dark then into the squad car with his head drooping and his arms in a crook and i went on home cause what the hell am i going to do on a basketball court and it getting to be nearly midnight i didnt see manny no more after he got into that squad car but they didnt kill him after all cause miss rose heard he was in some kind of big house for people what lose their marbles and then it was spring finally and me and violet was in this very boss fashion show at the center and miss rose bought me my first corsageyellow roses to match my shoes

the ssign 
by sam gf ieenlee
t never got bad until   we got in the cab and £ then it would get pro gressively worse iworse learned to just keep my mouth shut at first i would try to make things less tense by cracking jokes but it did no good we always took a cab into town the first two or three saturdays after payday i learned early that i could only stare at the rolling georgia countryside the red clay the pines tall and green in clusters and alone the bright sunshine even when the wind was biting and bitter outside i would stare and count the pines or the clouds or contrast the color combinations or do a number of other things to make the ride seem shorter and none of them worked we had both washed out of ocs for more or less the same reason we couldnt or wouldnt demonstrate that we were impressed enough by the prospect of being an officer in the u s army we were in different ocs companies and had gotten assigned to the same skeleton company of misfits like ourselves and had more or less migrated together it was a mutually gratifying relationship handy because misfits are unwelcome things in the army and they let you know it we found that we had much in common we liked modern literature hemingway for myself and he was a faulkner man hed read sartre and gide and camus in the original we would argue for hours picasso braque the german expressionists the impressionists i taught him how to hook and jab to slip a punch he taught me chess moves i showed him the insides of jazz the blues and where they came from bessie smith and lady day bird and diz he passed along what he knew about the classics we bought a portable phonograph with the first winnings in the payday game sent home for our records and spent hours after duty in the barracks listening pushing the barracks sounds into the background it was like this with the poker game i like poker but i could never take it seriously enough to be as good as i could be at least that was toms analysis tom was a real prohe lost now and then anyone who doesnt cheat loses  but he wins a lot more often than he loses we decided to pool a given amount each payday and he would play that and no more as an investment if we lost we always had enough between us to make it into town for at least one fair weekend and to make it through the month on a modified austerity program if we won as was usual we could live it up saturdays were always the best and when we went into town they were also the worst during the week we might play basketball after chow or chess or go to a movie or wander over to the library to see what they had that was new or just chew the fat saturdays we had inspection and the rest of the day was ours we would sit around listening to the music that was almost drowned out by the gis getting ready for a big night sprawled on the bunks while they went through the frenetic frantic ritual of getting ready for the trip to town we would wait taking it easy and untouched by the chaos until the barracks was cleared and then shower and shave with the latrine all to ourselves wed stroll down to the nco club and have a steak with red wine after a couple of martinis coffee and cognac maybe a cigar and think about later that night tom divided his time between a schoolteacher and a secretary he might have had more he is a very good looking guy tall and blonde with an easy laugh and line i had a doctors receptionist with an apartment of her own then we would get up and go outside and get into a cab and then it would start tom would get quiet and tense the silence would seem to get heavier as we moved through the red clay countryside tom staring at nothing his lips thin and tight and me looking out the window and seeing very little he seemed to get smaller and more wound up the closer we got to town chain smoking in the comer as we hit first the row of pawn shops and easyloan offices on the edge of town and then the good looking suburban homes and moved into the city itself id sit in the other corner trying to look relaxed and at ease sure i wasnt doing a very good job and knowing it didnt matter much because tom wasnt seeing much just sitting and smoking and staring we would pull up to the movie and id pay the cabbie and buy the tickets and we would walk into the lobby and id give the tickets to the man at the door and we would walk into the inner lobby and tom would go through the doors ahead and i would turn at the sign over the stairs and walk up to the balcony the sign a very pretty thing in red and gold said colored 
why i eulogized malcolm_x
by ossie davis
are not the only person curious to know why i y j would eulogize a man like malcolm_x many who w know and respect me have written letters of these  letters i am proudest of those from a sixthgrade class of young white boys and girls who asked me to explain i appreciate your giving me this chance to do so you may anticipate my defense somewhat by considering the following fact no negro has yet asked me that question my pastor in grace baptist church where i teach sunday school preached a sermon about malcolm in which he called him a giant in a sick world every one of the many letters i got from my own people lauded malcolm as a man and commended me for having spoken at his funeral at the same timeand this is importantmost all of them took special pains to disagree with much or all of what malcolm said and what he stood for that is with one singing exception they all every last black gloryhugging one of them knew that malcolmwhatever else he was or was not malcolm was a man white folks do not need anybody to remind them that they are men we do this was his one incontrovertible benefit to his protocol and common sense require that negroes stand back and let the white man speak up for us defend us and lead us from behind the scene in our fight this is the essence of negro politics but malcolm said to hell with that get up off your knees and fight your own battles thats the way to win back your selfrespect thats the way to make the white man respect you and if he wont let you live like a man he certainly cant keep you from dying like one malcolm as you can see was refreshing excitement he scared hell out of the rest of us bred as we are to caution to hypocrisy in the presence of white folks to the smile that never fades malcolm knew that every white man in america profits directly or indirectly from his position visavis negroes profits from racism even though he does not practice it or believe it he also knew that every negro who did not challenge on the spot every instance of racism overt or covert committed against him and his people who chose instead to swallow his spit and go on smiling was an uncle tom and a traitor without balls or guts or any other commonly accepted aspects of manhood now we knew all these things as well as malcolm did but we also knew what happened to people who stick their necks out and say them and if all the lies we tell ourselves by way of extenuation were put into print it would constitute one of the great chapters in the history of mans justifiable cowardice in the face of other men but malcolm kept snatching our lies away he kept shouting the painful truth we whites and blacks did not want to hear from all the housetops and he wouldnt stop for love nor money you can imagine what a howling shocking nuisance this man was to both negroes and whites once malcolm fastened on you you could not escape he was one of the most fascinating and charming men i have ever met and never hesitated to take his attractiveness and beat you to death with it yet his irritation though painful to us was most salutary he would make you angry as hell but he would also make you proud it was impossible to remain defensive and apologetic about being a negro in his presence he wouldnt let you and you always left his presence with the sneaky suspicion that maybe after all you were a man but in explaining malcolm let me take care not to explain him away he had been a criminal an addict a pimp and a prisoner a racist and a hater he had really believed the white man was a devil but all this had changed two days before his death in commenting to gordon parks about his past life he said that was a mad scene the sickness and madness of those days im glad to be free of them  malcolm_x continued and malcolm was free no one who knew him before and after his trip to mecca could doubt that he had completely abandoned racism separatism and hatred but he had not abandoned his shockeffect statements his bristling agitation for immediate freedom in this country not only for blacks but for everybody and most of all in the area of race relations he still delighted in twisting the white mans tail and in making uncle toms compromisers and accommodationistsi deliberately include myself thoroughly ashamed of the urbane and smiling hypocrisy we practice merely to exist in a world whose values we both envy and despise but even had malcolm not changed he would still have been a relevant figure on the american scene standing in relation as he does to the responsible civil_rights leaders just about where john brown stood in relation to the responsible abolitionist in the fight against slavery almost all disagreed with browns mad and fanatical tactics which led him foolishly to attack a federal arsenal at harpers ferry to lose two sons there and later to be hanged for treason i yet today the world and especially the negro people proclaim i brown not a traitor but a hero and a martyr in a noble cause so i in future i will not be surprised if men come to see that malcolm_x was within his own limitations and in his own inimitable style also a martyr in that cause but there is much controversy still about this most controversial american and i am content to wait for history to make the final decision but in personal judgment there is no appeal from instinct i knew the man personally and however much i disagreed with him i never doubted that malcolm_x even when he was wrong was always that rarest thing in the world among us negroes a true man and if to protect my relations with the many good white folks who make it possible for me to earn a fairly good living in the entertainment industry i was too chicken too cautious to admit that fact when he was alive i thought at least that now when all the white folks are safe from him at last i could be honest with myself enough to lift my hat for one final salute to that brave black ironic gallantry which was his style and hallmark that shocking zing of fireandbedamnedtoyou so absolutely absent in every other negro man i know which brought him too soon to his death 
the breaking the bond 
by lerone bennett jr 
is about to begin v black men and white men are going to meet for the first ¦  a c    a if  m         time in the womb of an american setting v look far off on the horizon is a tiny speck the speck grows larger turns lists and bobbles on the atlantic waves there is a cry a ship a ship on shore and men dash to the waterfront and peer through the late summer haze to the bored and homesick settlers of jamestown virginia the approaching ship is a godsend jamestown the first english settlement in america is a miserable little hole with a handful of huts and almost no diversion the ship heaving into view promises excitement and adventure but there is no way for the men on shore to know how much excitement the ship really contains for in the hold of this ship figuratively speaking is the whole vibrant panorama of negro america the blues and the spirituals booker t washington and martin_luther_king jr the twist and the charleston the bloody anger of gettysburg and the nagging promise of the fourteenth amendment the ship as befitting a messenger of fate is nameless there is an air of intrigue of danger even about the captain one mr jope who comes ashore with an elegant lie on his lips he has just robbed a spanish vessel of a cargo of africans bound for the west indies but he does not mention that he ptends john rolfe notes with suspicion that he is in great need of food and he offers to exchange his cargo for victualled the deal is arranged antonio isabella pedro and seventeen other africans with spanish names debark and an argument begins it is august   years before emancipation  years before the long hot summer of  the question in august of  as in august of  was what shall we do with for to and about the black people it was a question that would be asked over and over again in the years to come and it would be answered over and over again as it was answered in the beginningwith a compromise it was decided in the summer of  to hand the black people over to the colony instead of to individuals the twenty black seeds of jamestown were farmed out to various officials of the colonyand they were farmed out as servants and not slaves in court and church records the first black americans were listed as servants this is a point of immense significance in the history of america the first black immigrants were not slaves nor were the first white immigrants free most of the english colonists in the beginning were indentured servants that is they were sold or they sold themselves to the colony or to individual planters for a stipulated number of years five or seven or more to pay the price for their passage in virginia and other colonies the first black immigrants fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic pattern that carried no implications of racial inferiority during this transitional period of  years or more a period of primary importance in the history of america the first negro immigrants mingled with whites on a basis of substantial equality history masks the faces and emotions of the black men and women who lived in this racial wonderland the record burns with their presence but the record is strangely silent on their reactions and the reactions of their white colleagues the black founding fathers enter history thus faceless men uprooted from the warm womb of mother africa and flung willynilly into the wilderness of an outpost of western civilization nothing on the record indicates that the shock was very great for negroes or whites the men and women of the black yeast soon dropped their entrancing spanish names antonio and isabella who were drawn to each other on the trip over married and became parents of the first negro child born in english america in  the black boy was christened william tucker in a jamestown church thus in the span of a few years the negro soul moved from africa to spain to americafrom x to antonio to william within the next few years scores of africans made the leap by  there were three hundred black folk in a population of about fifteen thousand some came directly from england where negroes had lived since  others came from spain portugal and the west indies a large number of these pioneer migrants were christians baptized either in spain or england john phillip for example testified in a jamestown court in  and his testimony against a white man was admitted because he had been christened in england twelve years since   some perhaps all of the first group of africanamericans worked out their terms of servitude and were freed within a few years the more energetic were accumulating property pounds and indentured servants anthony johnson americas first black capitalist earned the dubious honor of being the first person in the colony to hold a negro as a servant for life still another negro richard johnson imported a white man and held him in servitude this apparently was integration with a vengeance but let us take care not to exaggerate it is as certain as death that there were racists then but the record indicates that some negroes were accorded social privileges about equal to those accorded to freed white servants more importantly negro freedmen seem to have had the same industrial and economic opportunities as white servants within the confines of this system which can only be called equality of repression negroes fared about as well as whites they held real property and transferred it sued in court and were sued some negroes voted and a few held the minor offices of beadle and surety in a limited sense then the jamestown experience was an open experience negroes were free to express themselves according to their personalities and their different lights they could live with white people if they wanted to or they could live without them and some negroes interestingly enough wanted to live without them on the banks of the pungoteague river in northampton county a handful of negroes established americas first harlem in  anthony johnson imported five servants and received headrights a grant of so many acres per servant imported of two hundred acres along the pungoteague other johnsons and other negroes moved to the burgeoning development the settlement throve but not without a certain dissension the johnsons were a proud contentious folk and they were soon in court suing each other over infringements of contract or property the johnson settlement at its height included no more than a dozen or so negroes with very large holdings other negroes were scattered throughout the colony in integrated communities in  benjamin doyle received a patent for three hundred acres in surrey county john harris in  bought fifty acres in new kent county and phillip morgan with great optimism leased two hundred acres in york county for ninetynine years morgans optimism was not entirely groundless the bulk of the population at that time consisted of indentured servants who were remarkably free from racial prejudice whites and negroes worked in the same fields lived in the same huts and fraternized during offduty hours and predictably they mated and married there was widespread intermingling between negroes and whites throughout the colonial period colonial virginia peter fontaine said swarmed with mulatto children in this period little or no distinction was made between indentured servants and negro slaves and servants what little prejudice there was stemmed mostly from english class prejudice white servants and negro servants were assigned the same tasks and many masters held them in equal contempt it was not unusual in those days for a master to force a white woman servant to marry a negro nor was it unusual for negro servants to serve as overseers over negro and white work forces of particular interest in this context of developing community is the fact that white and negroes of the working class made common cause against the master class they often ran away together and in several communities they staged interracial revolts working together in the same fields sharing the same huts the same situation and the same hope the first negro and white americans aristocrats excepted developed strong bonds of sympathy and mutuality there was no barrier psychological or otherwise between them and circles of community and solidarity began to widen skin color had a meaning then but not the meaning it has now the basic division was between servants and free people and there were whites and negroes on both sides of the line one has to make an effort to grasp the contours of this world it seems somehow unamerican as undoubtedly it was since it has existed in america for only one brief spell and then by default a negro in this world could almost feel at home there was not the fatal split between being an american whatever that is and being a negro whatever that is if there was prejudice then and there was it was not organized and sustained by the intractable will of an entire community there was not in fact an agreedupon name for the phenomena to be excludedand names are indispensable for good exclusion the first negroes were called blackmoors moors negers and negars the word negro a derivative of spanish and portuguese forms did not come into general use until later by that time the reality it was supposed to denote had assumed cancerous proportions in mens minds but to repeat one must be careful not to idealize one suspects that even then negroes asked themselves in the closeness of their hearts who am i god and what one suspects that the first generation of black americans remembered the old gods and the old ways and moaned the plaintive cry of the exiled jew by the river of jordan they sat us down and said sing us a song but how can i sing the lords song in a strange land how indeed and which lord from the beginning there was a tenuous subtle pressure more menacing perhaps because it was shapeless and nameless the tension points then and now were sex and status then as now the thrust came from fear fear of self fear of the unknown fear of the differentfear and a monstrous fascination in  a white man was denounced for lying with a negro woman which was said by the governing class to be an abuse to the dishonor of god and the shame of christians he was ordered soundly whipped before an assemblage of negroes it is a measure of the progress in civilization that ten years later the white man in a similar episode was ordered to do penance in church and the negro woman was soundly whipped sex continued to be a problem in the early colonies not to the servants who got on famously but to the aristocrats who were scandalized by the broad tolerance of the first englishwomen a system of intimidation was organized which increased in severity forty years after the jamestown landing white women were being whipped and sold into slavery or extended servitude for showing open preference for negro men the problem of sex was largely a problem of the negro male which is to say that it was a problem of power in the s and s which marked a slight shift in the relations between negroes and whites tentative restrictions were placed on the negro males in  for example all colonists except negroes were required to arm themselves this restriction and others of similar weight and meaning were reflections of a mounting fear in the world of men to grasp the significance of this development one must first understand the world context in which it occurred the planting of black folk on american soil and their subsequent degradation were episodes in a worldwide drama the african slave trade the detailed story of the slave trade does not concern us here what does concern us is the extraordinary nature of the initial contacts between europeans and africans africa and europe in the fifteenth century were on the same level of toynbees vaulted precipice of glory in fact in some areas africans were a ledge or two ahead the sudanese empire with its worldfamous showplace of timbuctu had passed its peak but it could still show europe a thing or twothe university of sankore for example and intellectuals like es sadi who owned a private library of sixteen hundred volumes at a time when the whole of america was a howling wilderness nor was that all there were huge empires and populous citiessome as large as all but the largest european citiesalong the coast europeans noting these things greeted africans as allies and partners in trade the recorded reminiscences of traders show that down to the eighteenth century they had no conception of their victims as racial pariahs on the contrary many traders expressed a belief that africans were their equal and the superiors of many back home if europeans forgot their place there were africans in this period to remind them the first africans were rather contemptuous of european claims they did not in any wise consider themselves inferior if anything they considered themselves superior to the oddlooking men with pale skins the king of dahomey seldom shook hands with white men and when he did it was a very uncommon mark of royal condescension a french trader complained in  that the fanti were so proud and haughty that a european trader there must stand bare to them standing up to each other as men and as equals both africans and europeans profited plenipotentiaries were exchanged and bright young men of the ruling classes went to lisbon and rome to study and observe black and white kings exchanged letters filled with terms of royal endearment my fellow brother and my fellow queen they also exchanged gifts and mistresses of various hues and dispositions shakespeares laudatory phrase i speak of africa and golden joys was not conjured up out of the air the phrase was solidly grounded in the realities of life in the first phase of the africaneuropean dialogue a dialogue consisting of trade in men and goods and ideas as in jamestown africans speedily absorbed the fundamentals of the european way of life on may   one hundred years before the jamestown landing henry of the congo led a mission to the vatican formally addressed the pope in latin and was appointed bishop of the congo in rome lisbon and other european control centers africans rose to high positions in church and state and negro gametes were scattered throughout the populations of europe by  the southern portion of portugal was predominantly negro and as far north as lisbon negroes outnumbered whites descendants of these christianized africans were among the first settlers of the new world as slaves servants and scouts they accompanied spanish french and portuguese explorers in the pioneer penetrations of north and south africa thirty negroes were with balboa when he discovered the pacific ocean three hundred went with cortez into mexico and some of them planted and harvested the first wheat crop in the new world the shape of this period is summed up in an old saying the first white man to meet an indian in america was a negro this was true in many areas of north and south america a bold negro explorer estevanico opened up the southwest for the spaniards negroes helped to found st augustine in  and made up a large portion of its population during the colonial period negroes were in florida alabama new mexico and california as early as    and  respectively perhaps the first permanent settlers in america were the africans who accompanied lucas vasquez de ayllon the spanish explorer in  de ayllon settled in the area of presentday south carolina with five hundred white men one hundred africans and eightynine horses a few months later the africans revolted slew several whites and fled to the indians in the fervor of worldwide exploration and the commingling of peoples from different lands and cultures new vistas opened up for both africans and europeans it seemed for a spell that christianity would have the same fertilizing influence in africa in the sixteenth century as islam had had in the eleventh and twelfth centuries but it was not to be while the bright young black men were feasting in the courts of lisbon while the eager black priests were genuflecting in the courts of the vatican the dream was dissolving in granules of greed ships were already plying the seas men were already experimenting with sugar caneit was not to be the opening of the new world and the introduction of sugar planting in the west indies created a demand for men that casual kidnapping could not supply mens visions shifted now from the poor whites of europe to the poor blacks of africa and the africaneuropean dialogue became a monologue focused almost exclusively on a trade in men in vain did some of the more farsighted african monarchs plead for an extension of the old trade in goods and ideas in  manicongo the ruler of the congo states made a desperate attempt to end the slave trade in a strong letter to john iii of portugal manicongo said  we need  it from your kingdoms no other than priests and people to teach in schools and no other goods but wine and flour for the holy sacrament that is why we beg of your highness to help and assist us in this matter commanding the factors that they should send here neither merchants nor wares because it is our will that in these kingdoms of the congo there should not be any trade in slaves or markets for slaves we would be living in a different world today if manicongos plea for point iv aid and peace corps personnel had been heeded in the sixteenth century but europe was impervious to such pleas she was only interested in the gold of black bodies and she forced that obsession on africato the undoing of both europe and africa as a result of the slave trade white europe became a single group opposed to the rest of the world and a new and terrifying idea was invented the idea of subordination and superordination based on skin color slavery contrary to the general impression did not spring from racism racism sprang from slavery the concept of race was a direct outgrowth of the slave trade and it was deliberately invented by an exploiting group which needed a theology to maintain and defend privileges founded on naked force the first act of the slave trade the exchange of men and goods and ideas unfolded against the permissive backdrop of the medieval world which sanctioned negro and white slavery but the slave trade soon took a more ominous turn within a few years fifty thousand or more black men and women were crossing the atlantic each year and the soil of africa and america was drenched with their blood in the wake of this development a need arose for justification of that which could not be justified by any theory in western thought by this time of course the slave trade was the bulwark of the whole european economy a fact which made the search for a theology more desperate blessed are men who can steal without the need of theology for when the need for justification arises the thief and his cause are more than halflost as long as manstealing and manselling occasioned no public outcry the slave trader could fight down his doubts but when voices cried out in rebuke and remonstrance men cast about for a reassuring straw it was evil of course to ravage continents and exterminate hundreds of thousands of black and red men but what if what if negroes and indians were not men in the same sense that europeans were on this questionwhat ifwas raised a terrifying theology of guilt and fear europe emerged now as the great white subject in counterpoise to the nonwhite other the europe of plato and socrates was invaded by a new spirit a spirit born of the renaissance and the commercial revolution there was something amoral about this spirit something demonic faustian and recklessly individualistic stimulated by the invention of paper gunpowder and printing the three often went together and the opening of a whole new world beyond europe threw itself with a bloody spasm across the face of the earth ravaging plundering tearing down and yes building up this thunderous outer event when fed into the stream of internal colonial politics produced explosive changes negroes and whites in the american colonies began to experience each other in different ways they began to withdraw into themselves and to prepare in their different lights for the confrontation to come  i rx  si in the crucial period between  and  the furies began to gather in america for a portentous decision some negroes in this period were servants and some were free but an increasingly large number of colonists were falling into the habit of regarding incoming africans as servants for life this development a reflection of eddies and currents in the outer world was menacing but not conclusive the negros status until the latter part of the seventeenth century was so amorphous that ultimately it could have been defined in any one of a number of ways slavery or modified slavery was a distinct possibility for all disadvantaged peopleindians as well as black and white immigrants so was an open society socioeconomic forcesa worldwide demand for tobacco and the development of capitalist planting techniques based on the use of gang labortilted the structure in the direction of negro slavery in the fateful sixties of the seventeenth century men of power in the colonies egged on by men of power in london made a catastrophic decision that would lead step by step to the fateful sixties of the nineteenth century and the fateful sixties of the twentieth it was decided in the s to ground the american economic system on human slavery organized around the random distribution of melanin in mens skins beginning around  the planter class drafted and passed laws that made negroes servants for life intermarriage was interdicted and children born of negro women were ruled bond or free according to the status of the mother this was the fatal and perhaps irreparable break in the sense of community between negro and white americans it was the starting point the first turn on the road to the summer of  and the dangers beyond having made one step the white power structure had to take another more ominous step nature does not prepare men for the roles of master and slave it requires rigid training long persisted in to make a slave or a slaveholder men must be carefully taught and the lessons taught one generation must be learned anew by the next the negro and white working class of the s the bulk of the population had not been prepared for the roles outlined in the new script of statutes it was necessary therefore to teach negroes and whites that they should not and could not deal with each other on the basis of reciprocity of emotion and relation and this remarkably enough proved exceedingly difficult the forced breaking of the bond can be traced with precision in the emotionallytoned areas of love and sextwo constitutive factors in communitas which is by definition a state of organic wholeness between equals residing in a common territory equals who extend to each other complete reciprocity or the possibility of complete reciprocity in positive affects love sexual union marriage friendship social communion and communal conventions property law trade the complete severing of the fragile bonds of community in the areas of positive affects became the dominant note in planter strategy fearing a deterioration of slavery if the boundaries between white and black people were dissolved in the caldron of sexual intimacy the planter class mobilized every unit of power for an assault on intermingling legislatures began to grind out laws of every imaginable description virginia legislated against intermingling in       there were similar legislative paroxysms in other states maryland passed antiamalgamation laws in     the sentiment of the aristocratic lawmakers leaped out from the dry statutes in words like spurious issue disgrace of the nation defiline private vigilante associations and racial purists whipped the doubtful into line behind the purists and the good grey lawmakers stood god himself in the person of parsons who blessed the rupture in community with words from the holy bible but astoundingly nothing worked against the law as revealed by the parson and the legislator intermarriage and intermingling continued in america for more than one hundred years men would say later that there was a natural antipathy between negroes and whites that no law could mitigate but the record belies them negroes and whites were taught hate and fear they were driven apart by symbols sermons and signed papers every instrument of persuasionlaw religion prison banishmentwas used to destroy the developing bonds of community between negro and white americans who was responsible for this policy the planters the aristocrats the parsons the lawyers the founding fathersthe good people they sowed the seeds of the bitter harvest james hugo johnston who made a detailed study of this problem placed the responsiblity squarely on the shoulders of the governing class johnston wrote the system of life built up in the agricultural colonies resulted in planter control both social and governmental institutions were devices wrought by the planters the system of slavery may have been thrust upon them by england but the problems arising from it were first of all the planters problems and on the governing class is the responsibility for the system worked out in the colonies planters were motivated primarily by economic considerations but johnston added it is also to be believed that the planters wished to develop an attitude of race superiority    through a fear that at some future time the poor white might lead the mulatto and the negro in revolt against the established order my emphasis how was this policy justified at first the rationalization was religion negroes were condemned not because they were negroes but because they were nonchristians the limitations of this policy were glaringly apparent it was not permanent men could become christians as an increasingly large number of negroes became christians planters cast about for a more enduring disability something that could not be changed but before this step could be made it was necessary to clear up certain theological difficulties a celebrated divine wrote a long book of two hundred or more pages to prove that it was not a sin to baptize slaves with great seriousness puritans and planters debated this issue and decided that christianity and slavery were not incompatible it was decided moreover that it was a duty a christian duty to bring barbarians into the folds of christian civilization so their souls could be cleansed for the heavens beyond thus in the end god and profits were reconciled virginia in  clothed the ideological sleightofhand in legal language    the conferring of baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom after that it was easy the negro population which had grown slowly during the twilight interim of freedom lunged forward by  the number had increased to fifty thousand when the declaration of independence was signed there were five hundred thousand negroes in america not all negroes were reduced to slavery remnants of a free negro class survived and grew by natural additions manumissions and escapes the status of free negroes during the early part of the eighteenth century was relatively high but as slavery fastened itself on the minds of men free negroes were pushed down to a status that was almost indistinguishable from bondage what happened now dwarfed everything that had happened before the jamestown experience the early african experience antonio isabella manicongo all were forgotten there emerged an image of the negro as a person who was powerless not because he lacked power but because of some inherent defect in his character a defect related in some mysterious way to the packets of melanin in his skin the negro became in lewis c copelands phrase a contrast conception he was black to the white mans white he was the devil to the white mans god he was dark to the white mans light it was not necessary within this conceptual framework for men to do anything one was born white and in this aspect one inherited the earth propelled by this psychic dynamism the white ego expanded puffed up exploded and rolled across the face of the earth absorbing the consciousness and the souls of men born black red and brown the effect of all this whatever the intention and the intention was not far removed from the effect was to deprive the negro of legal force and standing in the community of men it was to make him a person outside the protection of law an exile a stranger and an outcast this as thomas jefferson pointed out in a rejected draft of the declaration of independence was war against human nature or at least against that part of human nature enshrined in black skins for more than four hundred years this war continued before it was over one hundred million black people had perished and twenty million more had been scattered over the western hemisphere when the war started there was no mask between black men and white menthere was no screen between insult and retaliation stimulus and response blow and retort black men and white men therefore stood toe to toe hacking burning and slashing murder piled on murder and a red ribbon of violence enclosed black people and white people in a circle of fate direct violent resistance this was the black mans first response to white power resistance began with sitdowns and hunger strikes on slave ships although every precaution was taken although the males were shackled together and guards walked the decks with drawn cutlasses day and night there were repeated uprisings on the slave ships at least fiftyfive documented mutinies between  and  not to mention fragmentary references to two hundred more the struggle continued on land there was a slave revolt in hispaniola as early as  the governor immediately asked for a temporary suspension of the slave trade because the negroes encouraged the indians to rebellion twentyfour years later the struggle moved to the american mainland with the revolt of the one hundred africans who accompanied lucas de ayllon direct violent resistance continued and reached a peak in the nineteenth century herbert aptheker the authority on american negro slave revolts has documented at least  insurrections and conspiracies in continental america although some of his sources have been questioned there can be little doubt that revenge and revolt were dominant motifs in the reactionpatterns of the first africanamericans the negroes who came to america in the eighteenth century were strikingly different from those conditioned by one hundred years of bondage the first africanamericans saw themselves through the prism of the old gods they did not feel inferior to the white men and what is more to the point white men were not so sure that they were superior to them there were accordingly repeated revolts in  slaves in new york city revolted and killed at least nine whites and a virginia plot of  prompted the lieutenant governor to order white men to take their pistols to church with them the first negro leader to emerge with any clarity from the anonymity of the masses cato of stono was an advocate of direct violent resistance in  cato led a slave revolt near stono south carolina the black rebels under catos leadership killed several whites fired a number of buildings and set out for florida which was held then by spain they called out liberty a contemporary account marched on with colours displayed and two drums beating some twentyfive whites were killed before cato and his group were subdued before anything else could be done before the fields could be tilled before monticello and mount vernon could be built the first generation of africanamericans men made in the image of cato had to be mastered the breaking of the slave the destruction of the african as an individualthis was the first task before the pioneer white americans in order for slavery to succeed it was necessary to annihilate the thinking processes of slaves naked power was not enough the white mans power had to be internalized the slave in other words had to be robbed of his selfconception and selfrespect he had to become someone else or pretend he was someone else much has been said and rightly about the physical violence of slavery equally harsh and far crueller was the mental violence the wrenching of minds out of cerebral sockets and the crushing of bones of belief and habit in order to control people as we learned from europeans in german concentration camps and americans in chinese concentration camps it is necessary to subject them to constant fatigue constant insecurity and overwhelming power in a closed system long before hitler long before mao tsetung southern planters had mastered these elementary techniques anticipating the devious tactics of the modem police state masters laid hands on the minds of their chattel by the old method of the carrot and the stick by terror and by smiles by whips chains words symbols prayers and curses the negro was taught to stand in fear of white power in some such manner africans were given a new conception of themselves a conception that carried as coreelements guilt anxeity and inferiority the laying of hands on the mind of a whole people the pulling out by the roots of old customs and habits continued for hundred of years hundreds of thousands died in the process and hundreds of thousands went insane but millions survived maimed to be sure shrunken shriven diminue but withal alive and breathing with enough fragmentary memories of the past to give them a mooring in the present and hope for the future the terms of that survival were harsh and selfenforcing in order to survive the slave had to give up or pretend to give up that which makes man humanhope ambition responsibility and will no slave could stand up to life as a human being to live for a slave especially a male slave was to renounce to renounce anger and love and indignation to renounce hate and human hurt to renounce the claims and the rewards of love the responsibilities of parenthood and the pride of ownershipto renounce these things voluntarily in the service of a higher ideal but at the command of another human will arbitrarily imposed by society millions learned to wear masks of renunciation in the inferno of slavery but few adjusted to their situation james redpath and others who called slavery a state of perpetual war between master and slave cut to the bone of the problem that which was human in the slave was always at war with that in the master which breached the bounds of the human far from being a humane institution american slavery was diabolically cured in that it robbed the negro of that sense of human dignity which underlies all social intercourse slavery destroyed the negros family emptied his mind and impoverished his soul more than that it made him doubt himself nor did the master escape unlimited power over menand especially womenis debasingone pays a price for it in the attempted absorption and destruction of negro consciousness the white man remoulded himself and involved himself catastrophically with an image that was both loved and hated white man entered into negro as w j cash said but negro also entered into white man subtly influencing every thought every gesture every desire and the two groups thus impaled thrashed about repicrocally making and destroying each other in an embrace until death or salvation between the master and the slave between the white man who approached the negro in the aspect of a master and the negro who responded in the aspect of a slave there was absolute silence it was impossible for the two to communicate because the ground of communicationequality responsibility and mutual trusthad been destroyed beyond that was the obvious fascination of black skin for white men and women the master opened his eyes on a soft black mother surrogate who ever afterwards held him in the lap of a monstrous and forbidden dream the black mammy who extended the breast he sucked as a child the black mammy who mashed with her own hands the food he ate who sang to him strange lullabies and led him smiling into sleep this image colored his dreaming and his desiring and later of course it was this womans daughter or in many cases what turned out to be the same thing his father s daughter who initiated him into the mysteries of love incest plied on incest behind the cotton curtain of slavery and the whole faulknerian drama turned in on itself in an orgy of oblique fears men asked themselves other men asked them what have you become what in the name of god have you made yourself and of course there could be no answer short of the grave for master or slave white man and negro were estranged perhaps beyond reconciliation but so were the negro and the white state slavery was aggression against the negro personality by individual masters but it was also aggression by the state which gave to a surrogate power to hold restrain work whip convey and sell human beings with the backing or at least the silence of every structure of power in america negroes were stripped of those rights of personality that are usually considered sacred between men vice immortality and brutality were institutionalized and given names the sanctity of the family was violated children were sold from mothers and fatherhood was abolished it is not generally recognized that american slavery was significantly different and vastly more oppressive than slavery in other areas in south america and the caribbean there was a margin of personality that the master could not violate in america the slave belong to the master absolutely it was true literally true that the slave had no rights that white men were bound to respect the old south was a totalitarian system dominated by one party the party of planters the party line was cotton and human slavery no deviation from this point of view was permitted either in the church school or legislature nor was silence enough men were required to say often and loud that slavery was good and that freedom was bad things reached such a pass that the declaration of independence was repudiated and thomas jefferson was denounced as an unstable reformer infected by unamerican ideas in the end southern newspapers and southern intellectuals demanded that the north endorse a crusade for the permanent enslavement of free negroes and poor white immigrants in the south planter strategy was based on the old maxim divide et impera divide and rule planters learned early to hide behind the images of the overseers who were usually poor whites and the drivers who were members of the oppressed class thus there grew up the myth of the good white folk who were supposed to be above the crudities of the poor white class on large plantations most slaves never came into contact with the real power only a crisis would reveal the true nature of the system most slaves therefore did not focus their resentment against their real enemy the planter but against the poor whites who furnished most of the overseers and who were the poor whites they were white people who happened to be poor they lived on the poor land planters did not want like slaves they hated not planters who were the real authors of their ills but negroes whom they saw as threats to their social economic and psychological wellbeing all this was pure windfall to the planter class which consciously and unconsciously fanned the flames of hate between poor whites and negroes fanned the flames and thereby controlled both classes utterly not only poor whites but astoundingly free negroes in the south accepted the planters definition of the situation this is not to say that there were no brilliant and dedicated free negroes but the great majority of free negroes in the south accepted the planterinspired myth that the basic division in america was not between negroes and whites but between free people negroes and whites and slaves having accepted this definition free negroes in the south were leisurely pushed down to a position that was not radically different from slavery having divided free negroes and slaves and whites and negroes planters turned now to a destruction of the community of victims in a desperate attempt to prevent the growth of solidarity and racial pride the only qualities on which a mass movement could base itself planters exerted constant pressure from without and fostered internal divisions within throughout the slave period as abraham lincoln pointed out there were packets of explosive material on every plantation what was lacking was the indispensable connecting train agitators organizers leaders to prevent the necessary connection between agitation and explosive packets planters concentrated on three key elementsfreedom of assembly freedom of movement and privacy of the home where arms could be hidden the slave codes the crystallization of planter strategy forbade slaves to assemble in groups of more than five or seven away from their home plantation slaves were forbidden to leave plantations without passes and they could not blow horns beat drums or read books slave patrols or paderollers as the slaves called them were authorized to make periodic searches of slave cabins the whole complex apparatus of control was designed to isolate the slave and to cut him away from social moorings but external control was not enough slavery could not succeed without the complicity of the enslaved to oppress negroes more effectively masters made use of selected slaves as agents spies and bellwethers this ancient technique was facilitated because of the differing relations of slaves to the center of power the basic division a division with implications and ramifications that color contemporary negro life was between house slaves and field slaves in the context of current realities it is definitely a hostile act to call a man a house negro or a descendant of house slaves the house slave syndrome a certain servility before white power and a fawning imitation of white models is used repeatedly today as a weapon of attack in the struggles for power within the negro community who were house slaves how did they come by their low repute house slaves were defined spatially and psychologically by their physical and mental proximity to the master class and their relative isolation from the great mass of negroes who were field slaves house slaves worked in and around the house maids butlers gardeners or performed special services as artisans and technicians as a group house slaves were exceptionally useful to masters who told them they were different who urged them and in some cases commanded them to keep their distance from the masses at the apex of the slave elite was the driver who maintained order in the quarters and bossed the slaves in the fields the driver was the archetype of the negro leader and his image would exert an enormous influence on the expectations and attitudes of both negroes and whites after slavery like practically all negro leaders until modern times the driver was an agentof the master class it was his duty to restrain negroes to pacify them and to see that they worked hard his relationship to negroes was anomalous to say the least having no power of his own existing at the sufferance of the planter and receiving minor perquisites so long as he supported the planters interest the driver operated in a twilight world between the oppressed and the oppressor that some negroes cooperated with masters and helped to make the slave system work should occasion no surprise it has been so among all people at all times the iron law of power is that most men of whatever color of whatever tongue will accommodate themselves to their situation and that a small minority on the left will protest while another minority on the right will seek to capitalize on the situation by ingratiating themselves with the powers that be it was so with the negro in slavery it was so with americans in chinese concentration camps it will be so as long as power is power and men are men what surprises above all in the slave experience is the amount of slave cohesiveness despite strong centrifugal forces there was a bond of sympathy between slave groups one discerns in the literature a systematic attempt to overemphasize the degree of intragroup conflict one student said there was little cohesion among slaves because there was not enough counterpressure to prevent collaboration this is an oversimplification of a complex problem there is never enough counterpressure to prevent collaboration in a totalitarian system france and other countries had a fair amount of social cohesion in world war ii but there was a bumper crop of collaborators in the slave quarters as in france collaboration evoked the ire of the community of victims in tennessee for example a slave named jim killed a slave named isaac for helping to catch him after his escape at the trial the judge observed that isaac seems to have lost caste  he had combined with the white folks  no slight offense in their eyes that one of their own color subject to a like servitude should abandon the interests of his caste and    betray black folks to the white people rendered him an object of general aversion subject to a like servitude sharing the same interests excluded from the general community and proscribed by law slaves of all ranks developed their own society which differed in many ways from the society of masters the locus of this community was the slave quarters the embryo of the harlems of today all slaveshouse and fieldwere members of the community of victims there were as we have noted chasms between slave groups but there were also bridges the basic fact in plantation life was race and slaves no matter how high they rose or how light their skin were blackand they knew it the basic psychological fact is that the slave elite needed the field slaves if only to have someone to look down on in the quarters slaves of all ranks could drop their masks in the circle of suffering they could stretch out their legs and their souls paradoxically the slaves who lived in closest proximity to white influence were the slaves most maimed those furthest removed from white influence on the other hand were the freest in the harlems of the plantations field hands had a small but nonetheless important area of freedom for a small part of the day they were not under the thumbs and feet of white people thus a man or woman could build a fragile windbreak against white power it is not at all surprising that the deep and brooding spirituals and the embryonic blues came not from the house but from the field between the society of masters and the society of victims there was little interaction conflict did not grow out of their situation it was inherent in that situation the attempt to deny negroes even a minimum of social life involved negro slaves and masters in a web of espionage a web of waiting and watching of measuring and spying and maneuvering in this web it was every slave against every white man and every triumph over the master no matter how petty was recognized as a triumph for the cause jeanpaul sartres description of resistance in occupied france illuminates the nature of the struggle between master and slave in the old south everywhere he wrote on billboards in the newspapers on the screen we encountered the revolting and insipid picture of ourselves that our oppressors wanted us to accept    because the nazi venom seeped even into our thoughts every accurate thought was a conquest because an allpowerful police tried to force us to hold our tongues every word took on the value of a declaration of principles because we were hunted down every one of our gestures had the weight of a solemn commitment there were no billboards in slavery but there were tyrantsand there were men who stood up to tyrants every slave protest direct or subtle was a step in the development of new forms of life organization every slave protest was a choice made in the face of death for life a slave underground crystallized around the stealing of goods the trading of information on the intentions and state of mind of the enemy and the hiding and passing on of fugitive slaves all slaves did not participate in the underground somea definite minorityhad been so crushed by slavery that they were timid and afraid othersmainly house servantshad been so conditioned by the castoff clothes and castoff ideas of their masters that they kissed their chains still others a definite majoritymaintained a sense of expectancy and hope that is one of the most memorable tributes to the indomitable tenacity of the human spirit the dominant response of the vast majority of slaves were discontent unrest and protest there were repeated insurrections and there is solid evidence that the south lived in constant fear of the docile slaves the most dramatic form of resistance was terrorism arson murder sabotage carried out for the most part by the socalled bad negro a germinal figure in negro folklore slaves also used a variety of techniques in undramatic daytoday resistance to slavery on occasions they staged sitdowns and slowdowns in the cotton fields on impulse sometimes and sometimes on plan they sat down and refused to move until work loads were lightened some groups fled to the forests at the height of the cottonpicking season and sent emissaries to negotiate with old master quieter still and equally effective was the daytoday sabotage the gate left open for cattle to escape the expensive tool or implement accidentally dropped or broken at one time or another almost all slaves dropped their masksa little the dissatisfied look the slow unwilling movement the labored stroke of the hoe the drawling tone the slow hearing the feigned stupidity the sham pains and sickness the short memory and always the mocking smile and the accusing laugh these were the tactics of the undramatic slave despite or perhaps because of all attempts to crush it the rebellious will of the slave endured there was something tragic about this stubborn will but there was also something heroic about it by escaping or helping others to escape by reading and teaching others to read by stealing and helping others to steal by homicide suicide and infanticide the slave opposed his will to his masters the unpleasant fact is that slaves did not feel that they had unqualified moral obligations to white peopleand white people knew it it was considered right and proper to steal from white people and to lie to them in an odd reversal of the taney dictum slaves acted as though white people had no rights they were bound to respectif they were clever enough and quick enough frederick douglass the great exslave put his pen on the heart of the matterthe break in community he was he said a slave of society which has in fact in form and substance bound itself to assist the white man in robbing me of my rightful liberty and the just rewards of my labor as a result douglass said whatever rights i have against the master i have equally against those confederated with him in robbing me of my liberty since society has marked me out as privileged plunder on the principle of selfpreservation i am justified in plundering in turn  this attitude of defiance and protest flows out of the bottomless well of the negro folk tradition few slaves wrote books but almost all of them sang songs and told stories it is to these stories and songs we must go for the slaves comment on his condition the spirituals the bestknown of negro folk products speak of exile and homelessness of wandering in some lonesome valley or down some unknown road a long way from home without father or mother or sister or brother the spirituals speak of sorrow and despair but there is something else a cosmic discontent a discontent so deep and pervasive that only the blind or hard of hearing can miss it in these songs the slave commented on a world composed of masters and slavescommented and analyzed and judged he also used song as a means of communication the whoops hollers and field calls contained secret messages about meeting places intentions and dangers as a matter of fact double meanings permeate the whole fabric of negro sacred and secular music consider for example the symbols of release de walls come tumblin down of battle joshua fit de battle of jericho the judgment pharoahs army got drowned consider also the obvious fact that the slaves identified with the hebrew children and projected their hostility and hate onto pharoah the slave symbol for the white master the biblical symbols did not appeal to all slaves scholarly interest in the spirituals has obscured the fact that the great majority of slaves were non if not antichristian the secular songs of this group were irreverent and impudent some which later metamorphosed into the blues were existentially absurd the negro slave also protested obliquely in story and folklore a deep and bitter strain of hostility runs through the cycle of animal stories particularly the brer rabbit series which a southern newspaperman collected from exslaves and put into the mouth of a stereotype uncle remus uncle remus was joel chandler harris creation but the hostility and the malevolent rabbit in bernard wolfes phrase came from the negros heart the central theme of the stories is the defeat of a powerful and wicked animal the white man by a weak and clever animal the negro in the animal cycle the weak prevails over the strong and evil meets an avenger for the slave the stories of rabbits outwitting and eventually leading foxes to death were a psychological release and a creative selfprojection this image of revolt and revenge became flesh in the leaders of the three great slave revolts and conspiracies gabriel prosser richmond virginia  denmark vesey charleston south carolina  nat turner southampton county virginia   though separated by time and space prosser vesey and turner were of a piece prosser and turner were field slaves turner was a preacher and prosser was a biblical student who found food for insurrection in the blood and doom passages of the old testment vesey on the other hand was a free man a welltodo carpenter he was by his own admission satisfied with his condition yet he risked his life and paid the supreme price in a bold effort to free his brothers vesey was relatively old about fiftyfour turner and prosser were young thirtyone and twentyfour respectively the three men were obsessed by one dominant idea the destruction of all white people in their view the enemy was society the only solution they believed was a war of immediate and total extermination nat turner was moved by a mystical obsession that god had called him to rise up and slay my enemies with their own weapons like joan of arc he had provocative visions of the impending doom of his adversaries gabriel and vesey on the other hand were motivated by the revolutionary concepts of the american haitian and french revolutions gabriel and his men in fact had purchased a white silk flag on which were inscribed the words liberte on mort of the three men nat turner came closest to succeeding for fortyeight hours he held southampton county in a black embrace of death with a long bloody sprawl he threw himself on his masters and slew sixty men women and children before he was defeated nat was hanged finally but his spirit lived on his career it has been said made an impact upon the south as great as the careers of john c calhoun or thomas jefferson after nat it was no longer possible for men to pretend there were men in the slave quarters one could not always depend on their masks at any moment the mask could turn into a horrid face of blood and vengeance gabriel prosser and denmark vesey did not succeed they were thwarted at the last moment by the treachery of house slaves but the record shows that they were leaders of largescale liberation movements both men laid their plans with great care storing weapons and disguises and creating huge organizations under the eyes and noses of the masters gabriel worked underground for four or five months holding meetings at fish fries and barbecues stealing into richmond once a week to study the terrain he had enlisted according to contemporary estimates from two thousand to fifty thousand slaves vesey who was by far the most astute of the slave rebels demonstrated a talent bordering on genius he worked undercover in charleston and environs for more than five years signing up whole plantations perfecting a celllike organization that was never cracked it has been estimated that more than nine thousand slaves were involved in his attempt to destroy slavery the three great slave revolts were in essence attempts to recreate community in rebellion turner prosser and vesey illuminated the chasm between man and man and man and state throwing their bodies across the great divide these three created a boundary situation a limiting moment of lucidity in which the master confronted traumatically the boundaries of freedom between man and man the implications of all this were clear enough and bad enough fearing a total conflagration men grew anxious and a language or rather a nonlanguage was invented to hold the terror that lived in mens hearts as the civil war approached slavery became to appropriate melvilles arresting metaphor a great white whale which threatened to devour both negroes and whites the long arm of slavery reached out and compromised the constitution which contained three proslavery clauses it blunted the force of jefferson and washington and twisted lincolns words in his mouth the slave experience is basic to an understanding of current racial realities it is the substructure of both segregation de facto and de jure and movements against segregation as a result of slavery whites were overwhelmed by a guilt so monstrous and pervading that it poisoned thought at its very roots another legacy of this period is a deep fear of the negro not a physical fear but something deeper and more menacing a fear of losing grip on life a fear of losing control and to this must be added the immense counterweight of negro embitterment the habit of regarding the state as an expression of the white personality the perfervid fascination with negro sex life the polarization of the north and south the noblesse oblige approach to negroes as suppliants seeking handouts rather than citizens with inalienable rights no man can bestow or withhold and above all the rupture in community between black man and white man and black man and the state all these are legacies of the slave substructure slavery in sum was a seed experience the significant dimensions of the race problem the special dynamism that gave the summers of  and  their special harshness are reflections of eddies that lie deep in the mind and deep in the past the negro is what he is today because he was once held in slavery by white people and white people are what they are today because they cannot forget because negroes will not let them forget what they did yesterday the most dramatic link with this substructure of remembered wrong is the image of the young student sittingin at a lunch counter reading hegel or aristotle and singing the same song that sustained his greatgrandmother in the slave cabins oh freedom oh freedom oh lord freedom over me and before vd be a slave id be buried in my grave an go home to my lord and be free the song and the students use of it tell us how much things have changed and how much they have remained the same even more significant is the fact that the song invokes something that transcends time and slaves and masters something that was honored in rome and athens and will be honored as long as man breathessomething in man that does not love walls and chains
