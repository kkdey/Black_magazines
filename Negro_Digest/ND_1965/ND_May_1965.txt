aperusal of recent studies reveals some curious facts about the way negroes spend iheir money they were found to splurge in certain spheres in a pathetic effortsome authors believeto compensate for white contempt while there is not much new about that hypothesis some of the elements of negro spending when compared to whites at the same income levels are interesting enough to warrant close inspection take for example the negros special devotion to clothing particularly their preoccupation with hats and shoes negroes buy dress shoes almost twice as frequently as whites the new york times reports a survey of  neighborhood stores conducted by jack schwartz a social science research analyst for the united states information agency found hats and shoes more frequently exhibited to negroes and more frequently placed in ebony advertisements than in life however i do not accept in full schwartzs explanation that negroes buy hats and shoes in a way to conceal their personal characteristics such as long narrow shoes for thick chubby feet and hats to hide the texture of their hair although this is done sometimes in an effort to approximate the frail characteristics of the white ideal i believe that the basic explanation rests in a cultural pattern whose roots reach back to slavery negro slaves were often compelled to go without shoes even in winter and without hats under the hot summer sun according to accounts by ullrich phillips in american negro slavery and the testimony of my late paternal grandmother who was a slave child in tennessee negroes accordingly came to overvalue these apparels as indicated by the songs they sang they sang in their fantasies that all gods chilluns had shoes and were going to put them on when we got to heaven anyway slaves in general were sick of wearing only handmedown clothes from white masters and their families and placed a high value on the possession of personal clothing but the fixation of todays urban negro on clothing has some subtle sociopsychological foundations thorsten veblen theory of the leisure class describing the antics of the white leisure class of a generation or more agowhich the negro particularly the upper class is just now emulatingpointed out that clothing gained a special significance in the city in the small rural communities from which most big city negroes have migrated everybody knew how many suits you owned and whether you ordered them from montgomery wards or spiegels and what price you paid as well as your general socioeconomic status so it was useless to put on a front but in the anonymity of the city to which negroes have more suddenly and extensively been exposed the strangers one encounters on the bus and the subway do not know ones true status thus the need to spotlight position by attire veblen also observed that the practice of creasing pants and shining shoes arose because of the need for leisure class individuals to show that they were free from work working class persons began to emulate them pretending themselves when possible to be free from work since one could not have done manual labor and kept shoes shined and pants creased during my days as a dishwasher busboy and factory laborer i observed some persons wearing their dress suits to work and leaving them in the locker while they changed over to work shoes and clothes one individual even carried a brief case so that people on public vehicles would think he was a lawyer all of this is to say that a negro dressed in a hat and fancy shoes is obviously not a laborer this condition occurs so seldom that he desires to spotlight it when he can add to this the fact that negroes are more likely to have a rural background where they grew accustomed to walking more and to wearing out their shoes by more walking the resulting corns may cause them to pay more attention to the quality of their shoes hats however cannot be readily rationalized except as stated above in general negroes appear to buy what they want instead of what they need or as one oldtimer put it they buy what they want and borrow what they need they devote a smaller share of their budget to medical care for example despite a greater exposure to accidents and ill health it is pathetic to watch some children with correctable defects in the negro ghetto neglected in the matter of medical attention by parents who spend the money on other things one of the most interesting areas of negro consumption is food in spite of the popular belief that the best way to attract a negro is with food negroes spend a smaller proportion of their income on food than do whites at the same income levels it may well be that negroes seeking to make amends for conspicuous consumption in other spheres cut back on food intake or its quality i have known more than one individual to rely on a diet such as oatmeal or bananas three meals a day while paying for an expensive car true part of the difference in food expenditures is explained says marcus alexis writing in the american journal of economics and sociology by the fact that many negroes work as domestics and in restaurants and hotels where they get some of their meals free but this does not seem sufficient to account for all of the difference of the foods negroes do purchase they spend less for protein foods milk cheese vegetables and fruits than white families at the same income levels nor is it necessarily true as white farmers in the south sometimes say that a nigger and a mule can get along on next to nothing rather we may again trace the practice back to slavery and the southern plantation where negroes were conditioned to rely on the leftovers this gave rise to their taste for chitterlings pig feet pig snouts pig ears pig tails hog maws neckbones chicken feet chicken necks gizzards and greens many varieties of which they could pick growing wild in the fields and by the roadside besides food is consumed in the privacy of the home where others have no knowledge of it and so its status value is more deceptive there are however periodically planned dinners where some showingoff can be done also when company is present special meals typically including a surplus of meats are prepared in the pretense of eating better than is actually the case coming down to certain luxuries including personal care ointments hair pomade creams etc recreation and liquor most studies show negroes spending a greater proportion of their income than whites at the same income levels part of the devotion to personal care especially hair straighteners and the like has been said by observers to represent a desire to approximate white standards of beauty while this is sadly true to some degree we must again consider that while these practices may have been initiated for that reason they have now come to represent a cultural norm personal care also may have taken on special interest to negroes because in the days of slavery they were denied such commodities as storebought lotions for which they used grease scum from the dishpan hair preparations using instead grease fat or shortening and tooth powder for which they used ashes and baking soda contrary to popular fallacy however studies show negroes owning cars less frequently than whites but just because fewer negroes own cars does not mean that those who own them are not prejudiced in favor of the more expensive models also in the case of cars they must compete headon with whites who too have a fetish for fine cars in fact there is sometimes a kind of rivalry between the races many negroes have boasted of driving down south in a big car and watching the white folks eyes bulge the late prof e franklin frazier in black bourgeoisie found negro physicians who would not attend their supposedly scientific meetings because they did not have a cadillac or an expensive car certainly cars can be flaunted before others better than household furnishings and equipment which can be seen only by household visitors thus in some localities especially where there is a great tendency toward furnished apartments negroes spend slightly less on household furnishings this is not necessarily true of the upper classes however melvin tolson the poet has observed that jews will go into business and live in the back staying there for years while building up the business a negro too whenever he goes into business may live in the back but as soon as he makes a profit his wife is likely to lead him to throw up a big house filled with scandinavian modern aborigine furniture instead of a bigger business then he parks beside the house a car longer than the house is wide fraziers observations in black bourgeoisie would seem to bear out tolsons contention restrictions on negro recreation and his shorter time off from work might lead one to expect that he would spend less on recreation but this is not the case unless reading and educational endeavors are included in the calculations the answer i think lies in the fact that recreation is recuperation from the drudgery of work which besets negroes more stringently than whites just as negroes according to vance packard in the status seekers spend twice as much for liquor to lift their spirits they also resort to recreation for this motive frazier suggested that negroes also play a lot in the effort to get whites to take them seriously much of the negros expenditures on recreation in any case consist of money paid by the black bourgeoisie for social responsibilities we may conclude then that no single factor is responsible alone for the negros expenditures rather there are a combination of factors some more important than others they may be summarized as  the desire for social status denied them in a white society  the desire for social acceptance especially acceptance by whites and  the negros special social circumstances let us take them up one by one and determine their relative impact because of the negros compensatory need to clamor for status advertisers who must be aware of such matters in order to be effective more frequently appeal to  status when addressing negroes a pittsburgh courier survey of  housewives found negroes highly brandconscious with a special preference for higherpriced brands the american journal of economics and sociology reports a predilection on the part of negroes for shopping at higher priced stores especially stores from which they were formerly excluded i have watched some negro women shoppers in the more exclusive downtown stores some were observed to duck in an exclusive store first to buy a shopping bag bearing the exclusive name then head straight for the cheap sales others sneak down to bargain basements and fill their bags with goods hopefully without being spotted by anyone of their acquaintance if caught there by friends they may pretend that they had meant to get off the elevator on the mezzanine or were in search of the restroom women in the upper class have been observed to place their coats on the backs of chairs in a way to exhibit expensive labels others in small gatherings pretend that their feet are hurting and kick their shoes partly off to reveal expensive brands still others will lie about where they bought their new furniture and their dime store jewelry a study of lowincome families in new york david caplovitz the consumer behavior of low income families found negroes twice as likely to buy high priced television sets three times as likely to buy phonographs costing  or more and twice as likely to buy washing machines at  or more than lowincome white families a new york times report also reveals the negros quest for status in his purchases there is evidence also that negroes in the effort to make their swift transition from the personal friendship of the rural community to the impersonal nature of the metropolis seek fellowship and social acceptance in their buying activities prof joseph t johnson of lincoln university missouri in the negro potential has observed that cosmetics used to improve personal appearance and identifying property such as clothing both of which negroes spend more on may be used to make oneself more socially acceptable white salesmen have discovered the use of mr and miss when addressing negroes particularly in the south to be especially effective as a gimmick other negroes are swayed by the fleeting approval of a white clerks superficial smile a study of low income families in new york found that negroes were three times as likely to buy from doortodoor peddlers that they cherish this facetoface contact as compensation for metropolitan impersonality is borne out by the fact that the likelihood of buying from peddlers lessened with length of residence in the city the same study showed whites doing slightly more creditbuying from large impersonal department stores and discount chains and negroes four times as likely as low income whites to buy on credit from neighborhood dealers a study reported by john harp in the american journal of economics and sociology found migrants less likely to buy from chains and more likely to patronize neighborhood stores than in the case of urban born residents negroes however show a greater tendency to buy outside their neighborhoods or generally in white neighborhoods one marketing research agency found them especially likely to buy in the suburbs where they cant live in doing so they are seeking escape and respite from their own areas and acceptance on an equal plane with whites one member of a secret society conventioning in detroit when asked whether he had met discrimination there replied that he was too busy spending money to be discriminated against such negroes feel that they can buy their way through the wall of segregation can purchase white acceptance they are bellbent on proving that they are just as good by god as whites or more pathetically that they are in fact not even different from whites since they have few occupations of prestige they concentrate on consumption as a symbol of status they are dedicated to the proposition that all money anyway is created equal the ability to pay money becomes the only proof to whites that they are not inferior upper class negro women try to outshine whites at integrated gatherings boasting later of having stolen the show by virtue of their attire others get mad when store clerks suggest a darker shade of face powder a red item of clothing or a larger shoe in this regard negro market experts have advised white advertisers to use an integrated approach one went so far as to recommend that advertising be worded in such a way that no reference is made to race  as for negro customers an ebony magazine study during the early fifties of  families asked negro customers the question some readers of ebony prefer negroes in the advertising picture others prefer whites in the advertising picture how do you feel about this less than half of the negroes preferred negroes the new york times recently reported that the use of negro models in ads repels some negroes just as many are repulsed by colored dolls for their children when a store in chicagos south side negro section put in colored mannequins business fell off further proof of the pursuit of white acceptance in buying is the fact that a house in a middle class white neighborhood carries more status than a house of the same quality in an uppermiddle class negro area similarly an apartment in an integrated building has more prestige than otherwise would be the case although such negroes will claim to be motivated merely by a desire to advance the race this is not alone the case many are angered and resentful when other negroes move in and friends left behind in allnegro buildings will predict and secretly hope that the whites in the newly integrated building will soon move out this does not mean however that all negro splurging is due to their special quest for status and acceptance many are newcomers to the city anxious to lose their rural identities but unskilled in meeting easycredit lures and overcharging lowincome negroes are more than twice as likely as whites at the same income level to buy on credit credit not only allows them to purchase the goods they want it also gives a stamp of approval to them as customers as migrants to the city and frequent movers within the city they are uprooted and have few other outlets for social approval their occupations generally put them in a low class position and having little prestige on the job they are led to compensate in other ways among which is spending also women in the negro family have a greater control over the purse strings by virtue of their employment and historical position see the frustrated masculinity of the negro male negro digest august  this could help to skew negro spending in spite of all of the foregoing negroes are still too poor to be real spendthrifts as myrdal an american dilemma quickly realized in his studies negro income is barely more than half that of whites but this simply makes it all the more important that they spend wisely the money they do have
the roots of racism 
virtually all analj £ yses of racial and re y p ligious hostilities are § childishly naive and run away from the very problem to be solved by all sorts of vehement namecalling and outbursts of indignation accordingly any report of a lynching is told in terms of stark melodrama as simple and uncomplicated as a movie western the villains of the dramathe whites naturallyare the bad men the heroesthe innocent negro victimsare the good men lynchers then are just a bunch of hoodlums bums loafers and hooligans if only some way could be found to throw all these bad men in jail there wouldnt be any more lynchings the causes of the white mans cruelty to his negro fellow americans are various and manifold and it would require an analysis of all the complex historical sociological economic political and ethnic factors to understand a problem of such scope and immensity but however multitudinous and complex the psychological factors outweigh all the others combined the fundamental psychological cause of the white americans contempt for the negroes is his unconscious need to project his own inferiority and guilt upon another people unless this basic phenomenon is properly understood then the hundreds of books written about better interracial relations and the millions of words spoken by men of good will in lectures and sermons will continue to be of no avail when the psychological basis underlying the white mans cruelty to the negro is really comprehended then for the first time it will be seen that the men who participate in the mutilation and murder of their negro brethren are not necessarily all hoodlums and hooligans they are for the most part men like you and me and our neighbors differing from us principally in one respect you and i and our neighbors not subject to the same historical social and economic pressures as the southern lynchers have found less violent means of relieving the unbearable tensions of our feelings of inferiority and guilt very few persons in our society are so blessed or gifted or fortunate as to be free of feelings or inferiority and inadequacy unworthiness and guilt indeed so central is the torment of guilt in the western world that two ancient religious faiths judaism and catholicism have formally institutionalized the feeling of mans selfabasement the jews in yom kippur the high holy day of repentance for sins the catholics in confession the sacrament of penance and as if the consciousness of guilt and inferiority were not already sufficient to plague most people this sorely disturbing feeling is deepened with the passing of every day except for those rare paragons of beauty and grace who walk the earth in every generation the overwhelming mass of men and women spend their lives in quiet desperation regretting that their bodies and faces their talents and accomplishments their worth and achievements are so many millions of lightyears distant from their hearts desire how pitiably small a number of men can regard themselves in the words of the psalmist as a little lower than the angels and    crowned  with glory and honour and of the three thousand million inhabitants of this earth what an infinitesimally small fraction thereof would merit ophelias growing description of hamlet o what a noble mind is here  the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form through the strange and diabolical workings of the dynamics of projection we unconsciously seek relief from tensions of inferiority and guilt by ascribing to others the ugly traits and base motives that persistently trouble us with our own sense of unworthiness for the more contemptible we imagine others to be the less contemptible we then appear to ourselves that is why no one is so ready to condemn others as the guilty and the greater their own sense of guilt the louder and more vehement their condemnation of others all that modem psychology has discovered about the readiness of the guilty to condemn their fellowmen was foreshadowed in the deeply moving episode of the eighth chapter of st john wherein the woman taken in adultery was brought before jesus the benign admonition of jesus to the womans captors men bristling with righteous indignation has resounded down the corridors of time through nineteen hundred years resounded alas for the most part to deaf ears he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her in the light of the eighth chapter of st john and in the light of everything that modern psychology has learned about the mechanism of projection there is much truth in the epigram righteous indignation is being mistaken at the top of your voice how few of us suspect that even in our moments of ease when we are enjoying certain types of alleged humor we are unconsciously relievingby means of projection own feelings of inferiority take a blackface comedian the stereotyped negro comic so familiar to radio television and vaudeville audiences sambo is a lowdown noaccount lazy shiftless goodfornothing nigger addicted besides to chickenstealing crapshooting wifebeating and drinking how the audience laughs shrieks and guffaws every time sambo opens his mouth and gives fresh evidence of his dumbness his shiftlessness his nogood laziness his dishonesty why does the spectacle of such inferiority in a fellowhuman being amuse the audience the audiences laughterthe audible evidence of their unconcious feeling of relief from the tensions of unworthiness and guilt arises from their ability to project all their inferiority upon the negro buffoon before them for the black comic is an exaggerated stereotype a magnified abstraction embodying many of the contemptible traits that make us squirm with a sense of our own degradation hardly a man or woman alive is free of some taint of laziness hardly a one of us but is sometimes assailed with selfdoubts and bad conscience because of our lapses from aggressiveness and drive ambition and farsightedness and thrift virtues so insistently inculcated and so highly prized by an acquisitive society and so cavalierly disregarded by the dirty lazy nogood sambo so we laugh at the black clown in his loud checked suit the seat of the pants conspicuously patched and as we go into hysterics at his dumb remarks we unconsciously puff up with a proud feeling of identification with all the forces of white dignity and respectability white aggressiveness and energy and probity and we cast out from ourselves and heap upon sambo all our own faults and sins so greatly magnified in him but in the southern states with their huge negro populations and where negroes consequently are always close at hand the whites have no need for the stage and television to remind them of the inferior blacks inasmuch as the need to project is in direct ratio to the intensity and oppressiveness of ones own feeling of inferiority it follows that hostility toward the negro attains its extreme among poor southern whites the abject poverty of these people the wretched shacks they call their homes lacking the barest minimum of sanitary requirements drinking water and slops of privies being in intimate proximity their ignorance and illiteracy their malnutrition their inability to afford the barest medical care their more or less chronic infection with hookworm trichinae and other parasitic disease organisms finally their utter rejection by the upperclass whites is it any wonder that these poor souls the white trash cringe with a sense of their boundless inferiority but no their inferiority is not boundless it hasglory be definite limits and clearly marked bounds a white man in the south can sink only so low and no lower his feet can never quite touch the miry bottom of the slough of despond long before he sinks down into the dank slime of the nethermost depths his feet rest safely atop the black woolly heads of the negroes the poor southern white no matter how depressed and dejected has only to look about him and seeing the lowly negro experience a sudden elevation to dizzy heights of superiority from which lofty eminence he can now with lordly disdain look down upon the dirty niggers opportunities for such heady flights of soulsatisfying superiority are not wanting in his daily environment he boards a streetcar and cannot fail but observe that the last several rowsthe jim crow sectionare reserved for negro passengers especially unctious to the white mans ego is the spectacle of negroes standing after all the jim crow seats are occupied even though there may be any number of unoccupied seats in the white  section for only at the imminent risk to life and limb would a negro passenger dare take a seat in the  sacrosanct white section the poor white now glows with a sense of high status an expansive and heartwarming feeling of identification with the great master race the ruling class the lords of the earth the freeborn native white americans the poor southern white experiences the same heartswelling pride when he is in a bus station or a railway depot as he notes the two separate waiting rooms one for whites and one for colored and four separate toilet rooms all clearlyand with what a world of significancemarked womenwhite womencolored menwhite mencolored if only the dynamics of relief ended with the white mans renewed sense of elation in being thus reminded of his superiority and his renewed feeling of identification with the master race there would then be nothing too especially harmful about his preening and strutting but always accompanying the elation of supposed superiority over the blacks is a renewed and intensified contempt for them the projection of all the white mans inferiority and guiltupon the negroes thus unconsciously making use of the dynamics of projection the whites project their body odors and smells upon the other race by calling them stinking niggers their indolence by calling them lazy goodfornothing coons their physical and mental uncleanliness by calling them dirty niggers their colossal ignorance by calling them dumb boogies the extreme in the dynamics of projection is attained in lynching a white woman has been found raped and murdered a young negro suspect has been apprehended and thrown into the county jail awaiting trial the whole countryside is seething in a ferment of fear anger vengeance whoever the murderer may beand hour by hour as the mass hysteria grows all are convinced without proof that the imprisoned negro is guilty becomes the common object of the peoples mass projection of guilt every man in the community sorely troubled with feelings of sexual guilt since first as a little boy he was discovered in the act of masturbation many of the men afflicted with bad consciences as they recall their countless fornications and adulteries some of their carnalities reeking with the taint of incest some of the men troubled with the memory of even more secret sinister and forbidden lusts how cleansing and purifying to cast out of their hearts all the accumulated filth and sins of a lifetime and hurl them down the dirty lowdown nigger murderer this spiritual cleansing and purification imbues the whites with a high sense of dedication to the protection of white american womanhood and the duty to guard their chastity and to avenge to the death their ravagers and despoilers mass hysteria convinces the lynchers of the precedence of the higher unwritten law over the poltroonish delays and legalistic technicalities of slow judicial process and the sacred right that sanctions any redblooded mans taking the law in his own hands a tidal wave of chivalric zeal and religious ecstasy engulfs the whole mass of men now inspired and exalted with a sense of high dedication to avenge outraged virtue the excitement and elation of their holy mission at last brings to an end talk and unmanly argument and the avengers are swept on an irrepressible floodtide of direct action the jail is stormed sheriff warden and jailers are all swept aside like straws in a windstorm the cell is broken open the negro dragged out into the night screaming under the blows of his captors and now before the curtain descends on the final act of the bloody tragedy while the dry faggots are being enkindled for the negros purification by fire one final opportunity presents itself to the white executioners to cast out from themselves yet one more gallmg inferiority and cast it upon their live human sacrifice their burntoffering many of these men have been sorely disturbeddisturbed since boyhood enviously and jealouslyby the oftrepeated and wideeyed accounts of the negroes fabulous endowment with the physical attributes of masculinity their herculean virility their prodigious sexual potencymore like a stallions than a mans and so for all the white mans contempt for the negroes there always remained one area of lifethe incomparably important area of sex in which the white man could never with any real show of conviction boast superiority over the blacks but on the contrary if all the stories and legends were true had to admit of a crushing and humiliating inferiority the roar of the flames the crackling of the drywood the terrorstricken shrieks of the negro youth mingled with the affrighted cries of the birds and animals of the woods the visceral sounds of retching and vomiting of bystanders sickened by the savage spectacle the yellow and orange and crimson flames casting their unholy glow over the ghastly scene the champions of virtue are now emboldened to yet one final act of bloody cruelty which only their dedication to a holy cause could give them the fortitude to carry through once more they seize the black boy and with a crude jackknife or a razor or whatever instrument is at hand they mutilate and castrate the negro expiating his sinand all their own sexual sinsby cutting off the offending penis as the hot flames sear the negros naked and bleeding body and now to the unholy sights and macabre sounds of the hellish nightmare is added the acrid smell of burning living flesh and hair the avengers experience a thrilling feeling of ultimate purification the heavy burden of all their sins mercifully lifted from them the unsupportable weight of all their transgressions blessedly lightened their exaltation springs from a new sense of superioritynow for the first time complete superiority over the negroes the score is now settled the galling disparity is evened the cruel wound to their masculine pride is healed as they now contemplate the dying negro youth castrated and emasculated
wjohn conyers jr w was elected to last fall congress from detroits newly appor «e«r the statisticians had a field day not only did his election mark the first time since reconstruction that two negroes from one state would sit in the house of representatives but it marked the first time in history that two negroes from a single northern city would represent their state in the congress of the united states that detroit should be the city having this distinction seemed surprising to many observers who knowing that both chicago and new york have much larger negro populations expected eitheror bothof those cities to elect a second negro congressman long before detroit however for those familiar with the special historical circumstances of the development of the detroit negro community the historymaking election of conyers was taken in stride outside observers hastened to credit the united union litical negro motor cars presence of the giant automobile workers uawcio for astuteness of the the podetroit community making of course is the chief detroit and generaon the politics business of tions have been nurtured industrys prosperity and men like alex fuller horace sheffield and nelson jack edwards for instance are hi»h in the councils of labor and their influence certainly reaches into city hall and the state house at lansing but the rise to eminence of young congressman conyers with due respect for the support provided by the strong labor faction in the city can scarcely be explained simply in terms of labor influence conyers as a matter of fact is only one of an astonishing array of bright young detroiters who have gone to washington in recent years to help run the nations affairs and while conyers and his older colleague charles c diggs made the journey by way of the ballot box the others went to the capitol as available resources in the governments draft of the best talent obtainable indeed detroit is represented by more able and experienced young negro men in responsible government positions than any other major city in the country and significantly not more than one or two of these young men has a direct labor union background although it is altogether possible that some of them may have toiled at times on the assembly lines in the generation of most of these men the auto plants replaced the pullman cars as the interim place of employment on the road to the university degree it is true that conyers father is a uaw international representative and that young conyers had the support of uaw executive board member nelson jack edwards but then conyers opponent also had powerful labor support in the name of uaw official horace sheffield and the the citys strategic position on the underground railroad made it a sanctuary for negroes early in the nineteenth century and many of the slaves who had set out for canada found permanent refuge on the michigan side of the detroit river still the presence of canada and unlimited freedom only a few moments away added to their sense of security even when slave agents arrived from the south scouring the area for runaways the community prospered achieved a remarkable degree of social and political integration and produced a number of distinguished business and professional men who in restrospect seem all but astounding when john brown came recruiting guerillas for his excursion at harpers ferry he found well organized support from negro communities on both sides of the river long before world war ii and the era of highly publicized negro firsts in public and private life negroes were integrated into the economic and political life of the city negro lawyers had offices in downtown buildings a negro served as manager of what is now the citys largest department store j l hudson and a negro handled the finances for the entire county area some of the citys wealthiest negroes have doctor or dentist forbears who served almost exclusively white clienteles and invested their money in property rented to immigrant families pouring into the city from germany poland and italy
the negro families from the south found a stable proudeven prosperous  negro community when they arrived to take jobs in the factories before during and after world war i the old community proved a good model and the new arrivals put to excellent use the aday henry ford was paying they bought homes sent their children to college and took active roles in community development by the time world war ii exploded detroit had the largest percentage of negro home owners of any city in the north and one of the most solidly based middle classes important number of home owners fact that these homes were not all concentrated into a single corner of the city detroit negroes lived a pattern of corruption did not become allpervasive as it is for example in chicago the independence of the detroit negro in politics is but a reflection of the spirit of confidence and determination which generally animates the citys negro community racial barriers exist in detroit and always have but the citys negroes have not been thwarted by them they have if anything become more unified and sophisticated because of them when for example local impresarios refused to bring negro musical artists to the city schoolmarm nellie watts sponsored their appearance herself the nellie watts concert series under whose auspices the great marian anderson first sang in the city is a detroit institution when the larger community refused or failed to promote significant operatic opportunities soprano celeste cole founded an interracial opera company which continues to discover and train operatic talent these are only examples the cotillion club a civic improvement organization of young business and professional men is only one of several community groups through which the citys leaders influence the life of the total community the cotillion club did much to overshadow the citys postworld war ii reputation for ostentatious society wingdings by instituting an annual cotillion during which the honored debutantes were young women of exceptional character and scholarship rather than the daughters of the socially prominent the club serves also as watchdog over the local government for decades men like the late fred hart williams scion of an old detroit family and a veteran civil servant urged young negroes to take an interest in their history and partly because of him detroit has one of the oldest and most active chapters of the association for the study of negro life and history the city also had for many years the largest branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people detroit negroes have race pride without the insidious sense of inferiority which often goes along with it and here again the citys development helps to explain that partly because of the unionsand negro strength in themracial segregation and favoritism have been far less frequent in the factories of detroit than those of any other city negroes and whites worked side by side and in many cases shared the same schools and neighborhoods and it was difficult under these circumstances for whites to assume superiority simeon booker chief of the washington bureau of the johnson publishing company says of the detroiters in washington that they are as a group the most selfassured and generally effective negroes in the nations capital they are absolutely comfortable around whites he says they have transplanted their political prowess gained from michigan and are using it to give negroes new muscle on the national scene and helping the civil_rights movement far more than their more talkative counterparts booker also says that in washington detroit negroes continue the easy relationships with their white colleagues and consequently gain support for their views and projects they think big he says they are not merely trying to enrich themselves they aim for policymaking levels and establish themselves they are obviously able to compete in the market place and they seldom squawk about local segregationnot because they accept it but because they are busy getting into a position to do something about it perhaps of the personable crop of detroiters now working in washington the one with the most extensive labor background is william b gould and his association with labor came primarily after his basic preparation for employment in that field at  one of the youngest of the d c contingent and characterized by one observer as probably the most brilliant gould is attorney advisor to the national labor relations board a post to which he brings exceptional background and experience he is a law graduate from cornell university he did graduate study at the london england school of economics and formerly served as assistant general counsel to the uaw the backgrounds of most of the other detroiters with highlevel federal posts are equally impressive congressman charles c diggs jr a graduate of the university of michigan at ann arbor is a former state senator as was his father before winning election in  as michigans first negro congressman he was also head of his familys huge mortuary and allied enterprises the largest complex of its kind in the state he brought with him to washington valuable administrative experience william t patrick jr the first and only negro member of the ninemember city council until his resignation in  is possibly the only negro to serve the government as a layear executive on loan from private industry patrick a fine lawyer with an impeccable record of achievement and service in detroit reluctantly left the detroit common council whose members are elected at large thus minimizing the chances for a negro candidate to accept a post with the michigan bell telephone company as assistant general counsel his chore in washington was to assist r sargent shriver in planning the administrations antipoverty program leon m wallace who went to washington as assistant to the administrator of veterans affairs is now director of insurance service for the veterans administration a job in which he supervises more funds than major insurance firms in the nation a man known for both diligence and integrity he is preparing for even greater responsibilities by studying evenings at a washington university the detroit executive closest to the administration is hobart taylor jr who was associate white house counsel before taking the job as executive vice chairman of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities a native texan and son of a veteran houston politician taylor is a graduate of the university of michigan law school with a distinguished record as a private and public attorney in detroit he was brought into the kennedy administration by then vice president johnson and moved up

there  are times when i cant remember ever not being involved in civil_rights however i know that at one time i felt i could best help by living my own life quietly and showing others that sure enough equality was a state of mind or some unexplainable hypothesis i recall hearing of differences the need for minorities to be separate suppression the only answer and so forth i can even remember staring hard at peoples faces and watching their every move to try and discover this dramatic thing that adults would term different odd etc it wasnt until my teens that i discovered it wasnt so much a facial expression or movement or physical oddity but that it was color and even sometimes ideals or religion discovering what my elders had preached to be in conflict with what i believed i found the only recourse in active participation in civil_rights now i realize that i was almost totally ignorant of the meaning of civil_rights and the struggle being waged today in my midtwenties i find myself looking back and being ashamed at the surface structure of my thinking which allowed me to look pained whenever i heard the all too familiar why some of my best friends are negroes but    it had always seemed so clear to me that all we had to do in order to win was to simply make whites realize how unamerican they were acting it wasnt until one afternoon in a civil_rights organizations office that part of the depth to which the last several hundred years has plunged this country was revealed to me several young negro members were standing around talking one of the men was saying why hell man even some of my friends are white shortly after this i attended a small dinner party in one of our predominately negro neighborhoods the hostess asked if somebody would walk to the store for a loaf of bread it was a warm night a slight breeze stirred the papers in the street and it was a good night for walking on leaving the store i noticed a pickup truck with four or five negro men in the back and two men and a woman in the front they started to follow right behind me finally one of the men threw a paper bag and shouted whitey get out of our neighborhood the rest of the men picked up his call and soon i felt something pass my head within a second there was stabbing pain in my legs as a wine bottle smashed sending slivers of glass deep into my skin the men kept shouting hey white girl get out before we show how good black men really are the woman leaned out and started screaming leave our men alone white trash one of the men threw another wine bottle and it smashed against the building splattering glass in all directions just as i reached the entrance to my friends home a man jumped out of the back of the truck and cornered me in the entrance way the rest is rather lost in vague hysterical half memories there was a great deal of confusion however i remember the husband of the girl we had come to see pushing my date back and telling him to stay out of it youre white and will only make it worse joan of arci used to play her well carrying the torch of freedom to the oppressed and how sick and confused when forced to accept the realization that the hundreds of years of degradation suppression and denial had left a very real very ugly very white reflecting scar i found that my banner was not always received with cheers but could and was subject to being spat on spat on because of color spat on because i was white many negroes have told me repeatedly that due to the fact i am white it is impossible for me to have a conception of the position of the negro in our country perhaps this in part is true but almost any civil_rights worker black or white has been subjected to job pressures has been asked to move when it was found out that he associated with were seen with or knew someone who was labeled undesirable families have disowned refused to tolerate even refused to talk to their children who find they have a need to fight for what they believe to be right one girl i know has had her mother walk past her downtown looking straight ahead with no sign of recognition at one time i withdrew from any active participation having my selfmade white joan of arc image shattered finding i was not immune to prejudices and injustices and finding the constant assumptions of whites and negroes almost intolerable by assumptions i mean the forever present filth that seems to exist in some peoples minds here is an example during a dinner break one evening following a lengthy meeting one of the negro leaders and i went out to eat he excused himself for a few minutes and while he was gone a white man came over to the table and after a rather uncomplimentary opening explained in emphatic terms why no selfrespecting white man would ever touch me the meeting was being held on the edge of the negro ghetto and on our way back we passed several negro men lounging against a building they started taunting my companion and myself asking prices and saying other insulting things one man grabbed my arm and asked what was wrong with him for a stud after all he was the right color for my tastes also ive been asked by both negroes and whites the question who meaning men is really the best after all you associate with both you should know my period of withdrawal lasted almost a year but i am again active in civil_rights however it seems that during the time i was away i was able to gain perspective and a true evaluation of my own beliefs and a deeper knowledge that it would take more than tauntsindeed more than learning that spite exists in all racesto ever make me give up again understandably the years of injustice are a reason for many negroes having learned to hate whites but it is frightening to know that too many of us are blind and feel that once we conquer the largest battle white oppression that everything will be american there is a deep sense of shame when i read or see or experience bigotry for it is a mirror through which many negroes judge and cast their own reflections and these reflections are just as hateful just as full of waste the white battlefield is by far the largest and the most important but this well of intolerance that has been built up in negroes cannot be forgotten we cannot turn away but must accept that two battlefields actually exist one white the other black for what will it have gained us at last when picket lines for human rights will no longer be needed if the negro brings with him to the equality so long overdue the ugly reflection of the whites will the negro bring compassion and understandingor hate and oppression and spite then too i am troubled by what seems like almost insurmountable apathy in some negroes for work in their own behalf today i am serving on two committees that have had active programs to get negroes to join several negroes have joined in the past but they either do not attend the meetings or else withdraw from the organization all together why the majority of the executive staff is negro but try as we will we cannot get negroes to stick with these two committees the committees are open consequently to charges of white power structure trying to take over etc the greatest lack seems to be negro women especially in the various northern organizations i have served with so few negro women seem to take an active daytoday part in the struggle picket lines are needed but there are the evercurrent charges of discrimination in housing and jobs that must be checked verified and documented before we hit the pavement without the participation of all races and all sexes we find ourselves handicapped and without the people who could help us to fight john does and jane does all over the country white and black have to learn to stand up under pressures from jobs families and communities they have to learn to live with the question marks and insecurity that active participation brings we all have to look to himself but it must be his choice to be the best the laziest or the worst that he chooses to make of himself but it must be his choice not the result of social pressures there are thousands of john does and jane does across the country who are working for equality there are thousands picketing petitioning using every available legal means at hand and even a few are dying both whites and blacks have died for this right of mens choice i hope for the day when negroes and all other minorities are born with their right to dignity
the quality which separates the artist from the ordinary human being is the depth to which he is able to reach into his soul and thus give expression to those emotions bom of the human condition in this light odetta holmes felious gordon is an artist of the first rank and certainly the foremost folk singer in america with an evergrowing repertoire of songs she has enchanted audiences all over the united states canada africa and europe displaying a strong multicolored voice of an overwhelming intensity odettas forte lies with negro songs take this hammer john henry im going back to the red clay country but she is quite convincing interpreting other american folk tunes as well as those of other lands especially of british and irish origin a large woman whose closecropped hair styling and regal deportment is suggestive of an african princess her very presence on stage creates excitement and when she gives forth with her powerful contralto voice and rhythmic guitar she is a selftaught guitarist her listeners cant help but be captured by the honesty and depth of feeling in the moods she creates in fact there are few singers of any persuasion who can match odetta in this area she is a magnificent creator of moods who can at one moment drop an audience into the depths of sorrows dungeon and in the next instant elevate the audience to the heights of joy she can speak tenderly of love john riley then in her next number cry out in anguished protest of mans inhumanity to man he had a long chain on odetta was bom in birmingham alabama december   but moved to los angeles at the age of  where she was educated and where at a very tender age a musical interest was awakened in her this interest took her into the glee club in junior high school and upon graduating from belmont high school in  she received the high school achievement award presented by the bank of america which enabled her to study at los angeles city college in preparation for a career in the classics in  referring to this period of her artistic development she says if it wasnt classical i didnt want it however two years later after she had made her initial professional appearance as a member of the chorus of the west coast production of finiaris rainbow she discovered folk music while on tour in san francisco with finians rainbow jo mapes a folk singer and former high school classmate of odettas brought about her conversion in her own words i hadnt heard of folk singing until jo introduced me to it but i was sold on it when a group of her friends sang folk songs for three hours late one night i was converted this conversion gave birth to a dedicated artist who is constantly looking for new material and one who researches a song thoroughly before offering it to her public odetta goes deep into the background of a tune to get its feel and this is why when she sings for example the negro work song take this hammer she involves her listeners in a profound emotional experience it conjures up in ones mind a man breaking rocks on a chaingang and his utter disdain for that hammer those cold iron shackles and his overall contempt for the manner in which his situation has reduced his humanity when her stay with the company of finiaris rainbow ended odetta returned to los angeles where she worked for a while as a housekeeper after which she moved to san francisco accepting a job there at the tin angel it was at this point that she began to gain fame as an exponent of work songs blues ballads and spirituals a monthlong engagment at new yorks blue angel gained her a following on the east coast as well as the respect of such renowned folk artists as harry belafonte and pete seeger after her eastern exposure odetta returned to california to sing a moving version of the sea chantey santy anna in the film cinerama holiday she then appeared for two years at the turnabout theatre in los angeles before coming east again when she did return to the eastern part of the country it was to appear at the gate of horn in chicago at which time the fall of  she acquired a personal manager a grossman owner of the club it was also during this period that she recorded her first album odetta sings ballads and blues included on this disc tradition tlp  are such tunes as joshua easy rider shame and scandal and hound dog reviewers raved over her initial recording effort making special mention of her striking contralto voice and electrifying sincerity a second album odetta at the gate of horn tlp  was received with the same enthusiasm as ballads and blues some of these selections were timber greensleeves and chilly winds on the strength of these two collections her fame increased and in april of  she made a highly successful debut at town hall which drew the acclamation of the critics john s williams writing in the new york times of april   had this to say a highly cultivated singer    bringing to everything she sings the strong imprint of her warm positive and enormously skillful musical personality odetta has a large following among the college set and makes numerous appearances each year on the campuses of the country but whether performing before a gathering of  in a college auditorium or a throng of  as was the case when she sang at the march on washington in the summer of  she can reach an audience like few have been able to do in the history of singing in this respect she belongs in the same class as billie holiday mario lanza marian anderson huddie ledbetter and ray charles on december   odetta was exposed to a national television audience on tonight with harry belafonte a show in which her performance won a sylvania award it was belafonte who did the liner notes for her vanguard album vrs my eyes have seen released in  stating that especially in negro folk song her distinctive touch has awakened her listeners to the deepest appreciation and most thorough insight into the very core of this music a review of this album by robert shelton in the new york times read in part the most glorious new voice in american folk music    she has a voice so large and a physical presence so commanding recordings have yet to do her complete justice a few of the tunes here are ox driver song down on me ive been driving on bald mountain and waterboy odetta was presented in recital at carnegie hall may   an appearance which caused the critics to heap more praise on her and which further entrenched her in the hearts and minds of folk music devotees and patrons of the arts in general in this performance as in her concerts and recording dates during this period she was assisted by a very splendid musician and composer bill lee whose driving string bass had become an integral part of her presentation the year  was a very big one for odetta she recorded ballad for americans made famous by the great paul robeson in the s with symphony of the air and decormier chorale some of the other american ballads appearing on this vanguard album vrs are this land on top of old smoky dark as a dungeon and going home the  philadelphia inquirer had this to say of this album one of the finest albums of the year    done with beauty of voice and all of the rich resources of expression and sympathies embodied in her personality she was seen along with the baritone william warfield on the w n b c tv half hour special parable in the park her portrayal of the murderess nancy in the film version of william faulkners sanctuary showed her to be a very proficient actress odettas performance at the newport folk festival in june  impressed one critic thus the focus of the first concert was on odetta whose mahoganyhued sonorous voice offered what this listener felt was the crowning performance of the weekend a typical odetta concert runs the emotional gamut she can make one cry laugh hate love in recent months her performances have been augmented by bruce langhorne a very sensitive guitarist and les grinage bassist there is no better measure of an artists worth than to view that artist in a program with others in her idiom in january  odetta appeared on the television special dinner with the president which featured an impressive array of folk singers including the everpopular josh white even in this noble company she towered over her contemporaries as the mountain does the molehill
i am not prejudiced although martin p luther king might   § think so i am as lib e ral thinking as any man if they dont bother me i dont bother them the thing that puzzles me is why the agitators dont let us work out our own problems now take my neighborhood for example we live only a few blocks from them and usually dont have any trouble at all just the other day i stopped and gave one a lift when his car stalled we talked for awhile and got along fine i explained to him how i had some of them working for me and that i treated them as well as the rest of us he was a rather quiet onei guess it was because he was worried about his car so i talked a lot i told him how my father had come to america about fifty years  before and worked so hard to become a foreman at the stockyards he and mother still lived in the same house where we youngsters were born dad and mother would die rather than move everyone of us kids was born baptized and married within five blocks of our house dad said we should all be proud of the opportunities america gave immigrant folk to make good i told him how dad had explained to us about race it was beautiful the way he told us how birds and butterflies have wings but it didnt mean they were the same although god had made both of them the fellow must have been a sensitive one because he kind of choked up i couldnt be sure but he seemed to glow from down under his skin he probably had never heard it put so clearly before i was really proud of dad at that moment of course the guy didnt quite understand he mumbled something about what do birds and butterflies have to do with people then he said something that sounded like parallel evolution i wish dad had been along he could have explained to the fellow better than i did roy that was his name and i got along fine although he was kind of shy we stopped in the restaurant across from the gas station and had a cup of coffee while the tow truck went to bring his car roy emma shes the waitress and me had a good time teasing each other while we waited i called emma shanty irish and she called me a  name and roy said he had to use the washroom when he got back i told this joke about how there were three kinds of irishmen shanty irish highclass irish and bicycle irish emma fell for it and we really laughed when i told her bicycle irish were the kind that made your ass tired well roy didnt laugh too much maybe he had heard it before some of those guys dont have a sense of humor dad says they would be better off if they learned to joke more instead of taking things so seriously we ate a couple of hamburgers and i took roy to the bar next door where we had a couple of beers the bartender is a swell guy he waited on roy right awayeven served him before me i didnt mind a bit but i wouldnt let roy pay the bill although he tried hard tom hes the bartender and he owns the place too stayed right near us all the time we were there and smiled a lot more than id ever seen him do before he made roy feel right at home its funny because tom had always impressed me as feeling rather strong about the race problem it just shows you cant go by what folks say they cant hold their liquor too well because roy started talking after awhile you know how they talk fast and use words that no one but them can understand he kept doing something with a piece of chalk said something about being a student mentioned interracial parties kept talking about hypocrisy and got all hot under the collar well tom got kind of excited but i was on roys side its funny how little things can show what a mans made of by the time we left i was the only man there who still liked that boy ill tell you why something happened and i remembered what dad had once told me the local punchboard had come switching into the bar to see if she could hook someone all of us had given her the eye to make her feel good roy just sat there i watched him like dad had said roy never let his eyes move from the lip of his beer glass the whole time the girl was in the bar the boy was all right no one noticed it but me thats why i was mad when later the guys started needling roy i told him lets leave these creeps besides it was getting dark and i didnt want him to get into trouble we got back to the station and he was about to drive off so i told him how id watched him real close when the girl was in the bar i reached to shake his hand he must not have seen my hand because he gave me this coin instead looked at me in a real strange way and drove off i guess he was stoned why would anybody color lincolns face white on a penny
the idea had been growing in lukes mind so long until now it seemed to have been forming since the day he was born not the whole thing but bits and pieces which sometimes met and held or as was more often the case simply vague notions which danced through the brain leaving only bare traces of their handiwork but this morning as he looked up to see his old pal buddy york fresh out of the county farm walking toward him the shutter in his mind clicked for the final time and he knew he was going to do it he had to it was one of those things a man just had to do if he were to keep on calling himself a man they came together eyed one another for a long moment then broke into sudden laughter you home for good luke asked finally man i hope so buddy answered but i doubt it every time something happens they come and grab me i know luke agreed his massive head nodding sympathetically they used to pull that crap on me but i got em off my neck for good now you sure did but howd you do it buddy asked his voice filled with muted admiration im thinking bout hopping a freight maybe some other place i can make a new start luke laughed it was more of a squeal really without humor and raw with sarcasm you dont really believe that now do you man you like me you doomed from the day you born you just hafta learn t keep em off you as long as you can then when its time to go take as many along with you as you can take man theres lots of room in hell so take em all if you can he said giving that peculiar laugh again buddy gave him an odd look you sound like you know something he said finally i know a whole lotta stuff if you wanna know the truth luke said moving off and indicating by a nod that buddy should come along with him and i got a real big plan in mind he continued what i need now is a partner i can trust you interested yeah im interested buddy answered promptly if theres any dough in it at all my old lady just throwed the book at me this morning i gotta get a job she says she cant afford to support me and dave too dig that will ya where in hell im gonna git a job in this hole luke nodded a bland look on his broad face well you gotta look at it from miss matties side too i reckon dave aint gonna be no good for a long time now all that education he got is just gonna rust in his head man its too bad a smart one like him had to go marching against them fire hoses hed a been better off if theyd put th dogs on him man the way they smashed him up against that wall musta left a hole bigger than a watermelon the nogood bastards i betcha one thing youll never catch me marching and singing and being drenched and beat like a buncha cattle when i used to join them sitins i had a grenade in every pocket one of them mothers had hit me too hard and we all was going to glory hows old dave making out he inquired they were walking fast now heading out past the desolate shacks in crabtown hes still outta this world most of the time buddy began ma keeps on mumbling to th lord about what they done to her child and when is he going to be well again but if you ask me he aint ever gonna make it you cant dig a mans brains outtathe wall and stick em back in his head and expect him to be like he was thats what i know luke said coming to a stop before a small dollsize cabin i reckon miss matties about half crazy herself by now she had so much faith in old dave yeah buddy said slouching down on a big rock in front of the shack and you know shell never understand how it was him and not me got his brains busted out luke grinned you aint had any to start out with like i said you and me we doomed only thing we got to worry about is how many can we take along when we leave this glorious land of golden opportunity for everybody white he chuckled pleased as all get out with the impression he was making on the highly impressionable buddy then with a great flourish he poured some of the bootleg liquor hed brought out from under the steps into a paper cup and handed it to buddy who took one swallow and nearly choked his eyes quickly filling with tears man this stuff is strong he said its good though he added hastily white lightning luke said my special brew which i only serve to special folks man you being honored buddy nodded and took another sip much smaller this time they were far back on top of the hill with the entire town spread out before them the shacks of crab town came first like so many mangled toy houses each with its tiny outhouse which tinted the air with the perpetual odor of lime and human refuse then the main us highway swung through this disarray whanging the shacks off from an abandoned golf course where white men formerly played until the courts ordered it integrated beyond the course now overgrown with tall yellow weeds to the right were the small houses where people such as buddys mother and bushwacked brother lived poor folks they were but better off than the wretches who inhabited the shacks to the left a few blocks down another thoroughfare were a group of mediumsized wellkept houses where the welltodo negroes lived as a rule luke seldom thought much about these people who almost never thought about the likes of him at least not in charitable terms to say the least he viewed them with mixed emotions then far beyond this small island of black respectability and rising on a slight incline was the white mans world a world that luke was bom resisting and one that he had long yearned to destroy in the very center of this universe lodged the county courthouse which luke detested with such an unrelenting passion that it sometimes made him sick the business district spread around the courthouse in a haphazard desultory fashion like so many greedy fingers clutching a dying mans throat but the one building that always claimed lukes undivided attention was that which held the great southern national bank ten stories high and loaded with money it had always drawn his imagination like a supercharged magnet his eyes fastened on it now in total fascination what you staring at so hard buddy asked holding his cup out for a refill luke came back to his immediate surroundings a faint smile on his lips just enjoying the view man just enjoying the view he said pouring more of the clear liquid for buddy you sure got plenty of it buddy admitted tasting his drink with caution i aint been way back up here since i was a kid man you can see all over the damn place and things dont look so bad from up here not even that trap i live in luke shrugged howd you like to

nobody say about me but what they say that im evil damn right im evil if i wasnt id never stayed alive in this rotten town for twentysix years buddy looked at him a curious mixture of doubt and admiration in his eyes what about that white boy that time luke what really happened a slow grin broke on lukes face as his mind moved back nearly fourteen years what th hell you think happened i drowned his ass thats what happened he was white wasnt he the sonofabitch you mean you did it just because he was white asked the astonished buddy can you think of a damn better reason luke asked calmly they lynched my old man because he was colored didnt they they butchered your brothers brains because he was black didnt they and didnt they kick manda johnsons belly out because she was colored and had the nerve to want to vote so what th hellte you talking about man dont start talking no mess to me you sound just like miss mattie buddy was silent for some moments well i guess if you

idea now luke stared at buddy over his paper cup which still held most of his first drink he wasnt much of a drinking man long ago hed discovered the hard way that drinking and getting things done didn t go together too well he could tell buddy didnt believe what hed just said which was all right with him he wasnt sure he wanted buddy to know about his plan until he was ready to put it in action but he did want to sound old buddy out to see if miss mattie had washed all his brains out with all that waiting on the lord crap you think im talking crazy dont you man i dont know buddy began i mean i heard a lotta stuff bout you over th years but well you know how people are in a place like this they got nothing to do much but talk about each other and talk to the good lord luke added

that fay cat i mean howd you do it anyway luke grinned his face glistening with perspiration man it felt good he exclaimed damn good believe me it was easy too the little bastard kept after me to teach him to swim dont you know but i couldnt be bothered then one day i was walking downtown and saw him with some of his friends and he acted like he didnt see me course that didnt bother me i was acting like i didnt see him either but later it got me to thinking about a lotta things i remembered them hooded mothers dragging my old man out in the middle of the night when i was four and i remembered a damn sight lotta other things too if you know what i mean and i know you do buddy nodded and held his cup out and luke filled both cups then went on with his story well would ya believe it the very next morning th little pecker comes around again begging me to show im some strokes is the way he put it barney was his name you remember maybe barney stokes i see his old man sometimes now he works over at the plant and he always give me this funny look he dont say nothing for it aint nothing he can say for at the time some old white cat was riding by on a horse and swore the whole thing was a accident and i was trying to save old barney luke gave out with that eerie laugh and slapped his thigh hard but how could you fool im luke i mean the man musta seen what you did didnt he well you see luke grinned then drained his cup a second time you know where we were over at that old swimming hole which the university bought up later he paused then his eyes roving way across town and lighting on the state university which sprawled like an octopus in all directions the souths seat of culture he mumbled making the obscene gesture again when i git through with that culture seat they wont need no army to integrate it theyll need a magician for it aint gonna be there and that precious hospital neither thats right next to it and that your ma thinks is so god almighty fine yet they wouldnt take her son in when his head was smashed like a rotten tomato he turned to stare at buddy then man where your ma git all them aunt jemima ideas of hers from buddy shrugged they all got em he said in philosophical resignation your ma had em too she damn sure did luke groaned till the day she died she swore i drowned old barney and it was gonna be with me the rest o my life he gurgled like a fat baby it damn sure is thank the good lord and for the longest kinda time it was the onlyst thing that kept me going now though he added giving buddy a sidelong look ive sent old barney a whole heap of company and pretty soon hes gonna be damn near crowded outta hell but to git back to that day i showed him a few strokes on land telling him id just had my tonsils out and couldnt get wet i swore the water was only two or three feet deep and that he could sorta wade in and practice the strokes id showed him he fell for that crap buddy asked i mean i thought everybody in town knowed that thing was deepern twelve feet all over luke grinned that dumb sonofabitch didnt know from nothing he stuck his foot out and went down like a bag of rocks i pretended i wasnt looking in case somebody else was and he stayed down so long i thought he wasnt coming up then up he comes like a wet rat grabbing air and trying to drink the whole damn thing dry i ran and hopped in and went straight to the bottom and then got over under old barney and took this one foot when he come down and kept him down there awhile then i moved away from him surfaced and made like i was trying to find him then i went under again but couldnt even find him i had to come up three times before i finally saw im all tangled up in some kinda mess inner tubes i think and i brought him up then thats when this white cat comes  by and helped me pull old barney out man you shoulda seen him he turned my stomach but i was glad i was thinking this is one bastard what wont lynch nobodys father he damn sure

working aw sit down man luke said here give me your cup and lets finish this up theres plenty more where it come from buddy did as luke suggested his eyes filled with deep admiration for the larger man but you know what i dont git he began after luke handed him his drink is how could you carry grenades in your pockets and nobody not know it luke aw man luke began waving a long hairy arm youd be surprised what modern science can do and alreadys done you see all you little old fresh kids when you got throwed outta school the same as me all you could think about was having a good time now i went to the liberry and got some books and kept on learning i was always good in science class you remember that buddys eyes popped you mean you made them things hell no luke growled what i mean is by keeping up with whats happening in the world i know such things can be made so i got me somebody and had some made and a lotta other things too he gave buddy another sidelong look man ignorant folks dont know from nothing whats going on in this old world buddy sat very still hoping luke would go on but luke wasnt about to not yet anyway come on man he urged drink up we both gotta be gitting in a minute what about this partnership you talked about luke you still mean it sure i mean it man why you think i brought you up here just keep your mouth shut and your eyes open ill tell you more bout it later maybe tomorrow if things are going th way i expect then he saw the look on buddys face and realized what was on his mind he reached in his pocket and brought out three limp dollar bills here show this to yer ma and tell her you did some odd jobs for some folks out on the edge of town buddy pocketed the money eagerly thanks luke thisll keep her mouth shut for a coupla days when luke met buddy several days later buddy could tell by the grin on his face that things had been going well for him everythings just about in th bag man he said as they started off in the direction of lukes place but what i aint figured out yet is how we gonna git a car what we need a car for buddy asked surprised luke stopped and stared at him we need a car for ten good reasons he said finally how you think we gonna git the stuff set up hauling it on a bicycle look man you aint told me nothing bout your plans remember i dont know what stuff you even talking about yet luke gave that odd soft laugh thats right i forgot i been thinking bout this thing so long i guess i thought everybody knowed about it ill tell you all about it once we git up to my place but right now who you know got a car we can borrow or steal real easy i dont know man buddy began thoughtfully them people mama work for got a old rattle trap hes a intern at th hospital you know but when he come to see dave on thursdays he drives a new one he borrows from somebody at the hospital i reckon yeah luke got that calculating look on his face i didnt know old sawbones was still coming to see old dave buddy nodded the old lady would die if he didnt i dont see it doing no good though dave still just sits there and stares at the walls all day long thats a goddamned shame luke fumed young guy like him just outta college and as smart as a whip now all messed up for life most likely man thats what i been trying to tell you these crackers aint from shit theyll bust your brains out all over the place if they think you intending to use em that buck carson and his storm troopersll never git their hooks on me i betcha he stopped again and reached in his pocket you see these he asked bringing out two little colored objects about the size and shape of an easter egg buddys eyes bulged as he gaped at the sinisterlooking little balls yeah man whats them things them grenades you talked about th other day something like em luke grinned baby bombs old jake calls em you mean crazy old jake the pne who kept trying to integrate the university and they kept putting in the nut house till he cracked up luke stuck the eggs back in his pocket man crazy jake aint crazy hes got more sense than einstein ever had thats just an act he put on so theyd leave him alone and sos he could work at the plant and keep in touch with the latest scientific happenings buddy laughed man you let old jake goose you them things aint nothing but kids toys baby bombs he said laughing again yeah luke snorted they toys all right remember them two bastards what beat them colored girls up that time and how one day they just sorta disappeared in th  thin air car and all luke asked bringing one of the little balls out again well one of these little toys sent them two mothers down to keep old barney company and i could tell you bout a lotta others keeping old barney company too that these little toys blasted to hell but im gonna let you see for yourself you dumb ass the look on lukes fa e and the tone of his voice sent chills through buddy he didnt really believe luke but still there was something about him evil his mother always said and people who tampered with luke usually ended up missing or dead but nobody could ever pin anything on him even old buck carson and his troopers didnt bother luke much man you could git in a heap of trouble with them things buddy said at last luke gave him a scorching look you mean to say after all these years you dont know you born in trouble if you black hell man dont say nothing more to me every day you sound more and more like miss mattie you wanna forget the partnership they stood on the corner staring at one another as the blazing july sun beat upon them then suddenly buddy turned pale and began trembling slightly and luke looked around to see buck carson and three of his boys pulling up to the curb beside them what you two doing buck drawled luke stared at the red puffy face  and saw the mean glint in the small watery blue eyes and it was all he could do to keep his itching fingers from one of the little balls in his pockets we demonstrating he said finally verry verry funny buck said not the least bit amused howd you two like to make a coupla bucks tomorrow night luke pretended to think about that for a moment doing what he asked finally so look whos being particular buck snorted luke raised his hands slightly but kept them near his pockets we cant afford to be otherwise folks round here might git th wrong idea they see us doing business with you they figure you and your dogs and your fire hoses and lectric prods belong on one side and us on th other bucks face turned redder its my job to preserve law and order i do it any way i can he snapped luke shrugged we figure you aint too concerned bout law and order when th klan go marching in them bed sheets without a permit bucks head snapped back as if luke had struck him nobody tells me how to run my business you wait boy youll see then angrily he nodded toward the driver motioning him to drive off a terrible look transformed lukes face as he made the obscene gesture with his right hand no mother you wait and see im gonna git you befo this weeks out then he turned on buddy who had finally got his voice back and was about to say something shut th hell up luke snarled and come with me if you aint too goddamned chicken thursday morning buddy met luke at the appointed place an abandoned shack out near the plant where luke squatted near the steps between two soiled bulging laundry bags he gave buddy one of the bags and as they walked along heading for buddys house luke explained part of the plan to him buddy was astounded you mean we really gonna blow the whole town up his eyes popped his legs grew weak and he stopped walking and gingerly set his bag down suppose these things go off before we git em set up and suppose somebody sees us luke luke gave him a withering look man you ask more questions than a goddamned gallup poll i told you th other day if you too chickenhearted then git the hell outta my way i know what im doing and if you so scared of them white mothers you cant even take a leak for wondering if they gonna see you then go on bout your business they gonna hang your ass anyway man you know that but you too damn stupid to even fight back go on home and listen to your ma talk about waiting on the lord and see where that gits you go on he repeated and reached for buddys bag aw luke i was just wondering is all i mean i dont wanna back out now then come on and shut up luke muttered already it was getting hot and luke was still thinking about buck carson and how much he was going to enjoy blowing that fat bastard to bits and along with him the whole stinking town and wasnt it too damn bad he couldnt blow the whole state to hell especially the capital the goddamn mothering capital with that peaheaded rattlesnake of a governor who would make such good company for that mothering barney maybe if they got the car and things went well here maybe they could run up and pay old gov a visit the nogood mother he turned to buddy who walked beside him like a man in a deep trance what time you say old sawbones usually comes with th car about one or two buddy said then clamped his mouth shut to keep a whole bushel of questions from tumbling out luke nodded that gives us lots of time it aint even leven yet however when they rounded the corner where buddy lived they saw the car parked in front of the house and luke swore out loud buddy looked at him his eyes waiting for luke to blame him for this unexpected turn of events but lukes mind was working in other channels he suddenly realized that this was better yet the sooner they got the show on the road the sooner it would all be over come on he said to buddy lets stick this stuff in the back of the car and go on in the house remember what i told you now once you trip him on the steps leave the rest to me and if miss mattie comes down let me do th talking once they went into action buddys stage fright vanished completely and vaguely at first he began to perceive just what luke had been preaching the last several days then when dr pattersons big foot stepped within the circle of black rope and he pitched through the air as buddy yanked on it with an abrupt motion buddy nearly clapped his hands in ecstasy it was indeed good to hit back at last then while he was disposing of the rope luke disposed of the doctor buddy wasnt sure just how luke did it or exactly what he did but it was done so quickly that when miss mattie came hurrying down the steps the man was out cold and perhaps dead for all buddy knew miss mattie was horrified when she saw her employer sprawled on the floor but luke smoothly assured her that it was nothing really the doc just had a little fall and he and buddy were going to drive him back to the hospital and then the one thing they hadnt foreseen cropped up to haunt them miss mattie insisted on going with them and they had no alternative but to take her along she sat up front with luke her mouth pressed into a thin worried line and the doctor who now buddy well knew was quite dead was propped in a corner of the back seat with buddy when the car started the corpse lurched forward and frantically buddy grabbed it and held on as luke rounded the corner on two wheels miss mattie turned to look back her eyes bright with unshed tears that poor man looks just about dead she sighed luke she began her voice sagging with despair i know youve done something to him youre an evil man luke im just so glad your poor mother didnt live to see whats become of you boy her voice grated on lukes nerves especially since he hadnt really decided just what to do with her a man has to be evil to survive down here miss mattie he said wearily these white folks wouldve got me long ago if i wasnt it takes evil to deal with evil if you know what i mean she shook her head sadly her hands tightly clasped on top of the pocketbook in her lap you should love thy enemy luke besides all white people arent evil the way you think lukes odd laughter rumbled through the car and in the back buddy giggled as he hung onto the swaying corpse then luke glanced at her quickly i love them just as much as they love me miss mattie and they love me so much it hurts in fact i hurt all the time he said then let out a low whistle as buck carson and the three troopers shot by racing in the opposite direction and one of them noticed luke driving the doctors car oh my luke began up jumps the devil way head of time as usual he pressed down hard on the accelerator and the automobile leaped forward as the police car made a uturn and siren blasting took off after the speeding black sedan buddy was really enjoying himself now virtually jumping up and down in his seat as the movieland chase hit full stride how come they aint shooting at us he asked finally luke chuckled they know we got old sawbones in here and they dont wanna hit him white blood is precious buddy boy you ought to know that by now he said maliciously its all right to have black blood flowing in the gutters but not white blood black blood brown blood yellow blood any blood but white blood least that what th white folks think but theyd best wake up this the last of the th century all bloods precious now they dont know yet but they all th time wanting to be so high and mighty they gonna find they all alone we gonna gang up on their ass luke miss mattie exclaimed sharply shut up and stop this car this minute luke laughed and buddy giggled and then reported that buck and his boys were gaining on them i know luke replied thats what i want them to do now i wantcha to get one of them little eggs outta one of th bags and press that tip down hard and when we turn onto the bridge road take dead aim on old buck and let em have it man giggling like an intoxicated teenager buddy eagerly followed lukes directions get ready luke warned as he made the turn now he shouted as the two vehicles were at just the right angle buddy threw the green oblong object which had suddenly began to grow hot after he pressed the tip down man buddy yelped gleefully where they go aint nothing back there but a little old puff of smoke and no noise at all hardly where they go luke luke laughed shrilly they on their way to keep old barney company move over bastard here comes four more miss mattie who had been staring back looking for the vanished patrol car suddenly whirled on luke you devil she shrieked and vigorously started banging him over the head with her purse mama buddy screamed look what you doing you going to kill us all and he lunged forward trying to grab her flailing arms goddammit luke snarled then finally landed a solid right to miss matties jaw but it was too late now hed lost control of the vehicle it spinned crazily across the still damp road banged against the railing then careened over to the opposite side hit that railing and flipped up and over buddy screamed miss mattie screamed but luke laughed wildly okay barney you grinning bastard here i come with three more and im gonna work on you plenty when i git there mother and he still laughed as the car struck the water and disappeared with barely a sound only a yellow puff of smoke and then absolute silence
a great poet has been living in our midst for decades and is almost totally unknown even by the literati even by poets can this be possible in the age of criticism and of publication unlimited it is not only possible but highly probable poetry today is an established institution which has many of the characteristics of a closed corporation one of the rules of the poetic establishment is that negroes are not admitted to the polite company of the anthology poetry as we know it remains the most lilywhite of the arts a novelist and pamphleteer like baldwin is world famous m b tolson easily the literary equal of any number of baldwins is less honored in his own country than the most obscure poetaster yet not all poets and critics are at fault tolson has been recognized by eminent men of letters for a long time and at the extremes of the literary spectrum allen tate paid homage to him in an introduction to libretto for the republic of liberia an essay which is more famous than the poem william carlos williams in the fourth book of paterson salutes him in this way and to tolson and to his ode and to liberia and to allen tate give him credit  and to the south generally selah theodore roethke selden rodman robert frost john ciardi and stanley hyman have also tried to bring tolson to the general literary consciousness but with little success in a time when liberals are falling all over themselves to shake hands with negroes when a dusky maidenly model may even be hired for tv commercials when black skin is the literary rage poetry by gentleman of color continues to be ignored and it is ignored far out of proportion to the common indifference to the art it is one thing to accept an artist on the grounds of his art regardless of race and creed as long as the artist can adjust to the ruling grecojudaicchristian culture it is another thing to accept an artist who contravenes that culture tolson belongs to the second category he is in effect the enemy of the dominant culture of our time and place he is to use the term he prefers an afroamerican poet not an american negro poet accommodating himself to the tradition it is probably for this reason that the libretto despite its success destime failed to tickle the sensibilities of the literati and the professoriat the libretto pulls the rug out from under the poetry of the academy on the stylistic level outpounding pound it shocks the learned into a recognition of their own ignorance harlem gallery his new collection being published by twayne in march pulls the house down around their ears tolson writes in negro walter savage landor told thomas hardy almost a century ago that english was a dying language english poetry and angloamerican poetry continue to bear out the dismal  prophecy the glorious shreds of english are in our century daintily stitched together by the campus muse while the new language undergoes all its multiple birth pangs england is the mother of our tongue but nobody knows who the fathers were or how many it is a somewhat chaucerian situation bawdry high learning grammarlessness history myth all crying out for a jongleur or a poet it is not enough to equate tolson as his best critics have done with eliot or hart crane the cantos or ana base to make him equal is to miss the point just as it would be to make him better than tolson writes and thinks in negro which is to say a possible american language he is therefore performing the primary poetic rite for our literature instead of purifying the tongue which is the business of the academy he is complicating it giving it the gift of tongues pound eliot and joyce did this but with pernicious nostalgia that all but killed the patient tolson does it naturally and to the manner born here it is irrelevant to argue a thesis but apropos to suggest common sense the history of the negro places him linguistically at the center of american culture as it does no other nationality or race negro survival has depended upon the mastery of the gradations of english the negro has in his possession a gradus ad parnassum of culture which no other minority or majority can conceivably encompass this is the significance of allen tates salute to tolsons libretto only a southern intellectual and poet would be in a position to welcome a tolson albeit at the white front door one can practically feel the beat of walt whitmans wings against the dome of the library of congress the harlem gallery will not make matters easier massive as it is it is only a beginning of a greater work a kind of odyssey of the american negro of which this is the prologue the gallery returns to the basic themes of the libretto one of these is the accusation of gertrude stein that the negro suffers from nothingness written in a style conforming to the ode form of the earlier poem it is in fact a narrative work so fantastically stylized that the mind balks at comparisons the milieu is harlem from the twenties on the dramatis personae comprise every symbolic character from the black bourgeois babbitt and the lenox avenue poet to the alienated negro professor and sage who sits in the bar and elaborates along with the curator and the zulu club wits a platonic dialogue the giveandtake ostensibly moves on a level of talk about the artsa floor which is constantly caving in and plunging the reader into the depths of metaphysical horror which journalists nowadays refer to as the race question but like so many great works of poetry it is a comic poem it is funny witty humoristic slapstick crude cruel bitter and hilarious the baroque surface of the poem modifies none of this the harlem gallery is as if improvised by one of the great architects of modern poetry it may be that this work like other works of its quality in the past will turn out to be not only an end in itself but the door to poetry that everyone has been looking for 
despite all the stumbling blocks professional jealousies and race hatred negroes have always managed to carve a special niche for themd selves in attaining worldwide fame and acclaim since many years back joe louis in boxing and other boxers before him ben barek in football louis armstrong in jazz josephine baker as a singer and dorothy dandridge lena horne and eartha kitt as more decorative members have been accepted public figures whose road to glory was not a cinch but they made it as did many others despite the odds their individual contributions have added to the overall splendor of the public professions although the above singled out personalities and scores upon scores of others have been household words throughout the world little known is the fact that negroes also have excelled in the death in the afternoon art the first negro who gambled his life in the bull ring for a chance at fame and fortune was a peruvian named angel valdes born in the tiny village of palpa back in  by some unknown chemistry the youngster was scarcely six when he began to wave a cape before tired old cows and bulls and yearlings as usual everybody in the backwoods peruvian village laughed at the pretensions of the eldest valdes son he has no shoes on his feet scarcely a shirt on his back taunted children and chortling adults and yet he talks of being a great torero it is just too funny and we will die of laughter where will he ever get the opportunity no one ever comes to this godforsaken dustladen village but young angel supported the taunts and the many fights with youngsters his age when he could stand their goading no longer for the grimly determined angel there was no schooling but he never ceased his dogged practice with the hapless cows sometimes an aging bull would haphazardly and halfheartedly charge the boy then angel was in his glory showing off his footwork the ridicule of his neighbors did not daunt angel and their laughter had a hollow sound before long for by  the determined angel made his first bull ring appearance in the town of acho even dressed in a creditable fashion for the period there was an element of luck in all this for a mexican one jose maria vazquez happened to pass through palpa looking for fiery bulls no longer a bullfighter because of frequent gorings vazquez took to the young colored lad decided to teach him the art of the matador angel was an eager pupil of course in his first appearance in the acho bull ring angel played second fiddle in the cuadrillas four man teams of local toreros but soon eminent bullfighters of that period in peru such as salamanquino gonzalo mora and pedro fernandez added young valdes to their staff the youth was not interested in being little more than a stable boy or one who disengaged the attention of the bull when the torero had completed his passes adopting the name of el maestro the master young angel turned matadora killer of bulls his style was none too distinguished and valdes relied chiefly under the name of the negro from havana actually he was a descendant of the incasas were most of the other peruvian negro bullfighters who fought in their native land and in spain the most outstanding of the colored bullfighterswith peru contributing the greatest numberwas rafael santa cruz rafael was an automobile mechanic who first donned the gold embroidered finery of the matador on march   and he went on to the biggest success of all achieved not only in the lima bullring but in spain where he went in  his accomplishment was the greater since he appeared with such idols of the ring as joselito alvarez pepe escudero brother of the beloved manolo and joselito torres of all the colored bullfighters santa cruz develooed a style and presence and a devilmaycare courage that appealed to the crowds but a few years back santa cruz decided he had earned more than enough to last him the rest of his days he is now retired and engaged in business in lima this brief and not exhaustive history of negro accomplishments in the bullring a little known phase of activity of colored men is interesting in that never once dating back to  over a hundred years ago when angel valdes first paraded into the bull ring was there ever even a hint of racial prejudice the colored fighters were booed and hissed and sombreros were thrown into the ring a sign of great displeasure when the toreros work is mediocre however this was not because they were colored but because they displeased the audience by their performances as bullfighters finally the bullfight sport has remained impartial to all in recent years there have been oriental aspirants risking life for big money and possible immortality when sports writers wrote about colored bullfighters and their earnest dedicated if not always skillful efforts they always referred to them as these colored bullfighters with white souls whose courage never falters and of course to top it all off there has been an entire slew of white americans trying their luck in the ring also with most indifferent success about the only thing that does give a charge to mexican bullfight fans is the constant stream of american girls short on technique but long on curves revealed to best advantage in tight bullfight costumes for these the fans have a very special ole that somehow emulates that wellknown sign of appreciationthe wolf whistle
in recent news reports the congolese  have been pictured as savages and the belv  gians as civilizers yet historical records show that king leopold of belgium while pretending to civilize the congo cut and mutilated people and separated wives from husbands if they refused to be his outright slaves historical records also reveal that the congolese had a civilization of their own which was quite well developed and needed least of all the european civilizers there were several large kingdoms in the area we now call the congo the kingdom of ansika was comprised of the people of the bateke and bayoka whose artistic talents were very remarkable near the center of the congo was the bakuba kingdom or bushongo noted for its unity the excellence of its administration its art its craftmanship and the beauty of its fabrics the encyclopaedia britannica attests to the fact that most congo people are exceptional craftsmen ironwork knives spears arrowheads bracelets attains an extraordinary variety    outstanding carvings are known    the bushong culture kept its records and transmitted them almost intact to modern research the bakubas are an ancient people whose power and influence once extended over most of the congotheir history can be traced to the fifth century at the top of the bakuba hierarchy was the royal court composed of six dignitaries responsible for cabinetlike matters such as military affairs justice and administration at one time there were in the royal entourage  other functionaries including a master of the hunt a master storyteller and a keeper of oral tradition or historian in the sixteenth century the bakubas ruled over a great african empire the memory of their glorious past is recalled in the tribe with historical exactitude they can name the reigns of their kings for the past  years the loyalty of the people to these rulers is expressed in a series of royal portraitstatues dating from the reign of shamba bolongongo the great and best known of the bakuba kings shamba bolongongo was a peaceful sovereign he prohibited the use of the shongo a throwing knife the traditional weapon of the bushong this wise african king used to say kill neither man woman nor child are they not the children of chembe god and have they not the right to live early in the twentieth century when the european writer emil torday was traveling through the congo collecting material for his book on the trail of the bushongo he found the bakuba elders still singing praises of shamba bolongongo much of the history and civiliza tion of central african and east african areas was revealed by the study made by the portuguese african explorer duarte lopez in his book history of the kingdom of the congo he went to the congo in  and stayed for many years from his study and description of the congo we learn that the kingdom of the congo included the territory formerly known as the congo angola and parts of the cameroons according to lopez the kingdom of the congo at the time measured  miles at the time of lopezs year stay in the country the kingdom of the congo was divided into six provinces the province of bamba was the military stronghold of the kingdom and was capable of putting  well disciplined men in the field in  henrique the portuguese name for the son of the king of the congo was sent to lisbon and to rome to study theology in  pope leo appointed henrique bishop of utica and vicarapostolic of the congo this was more than  years before leopold king of belgium came on his socalled mission to bring christianity to the congolese at first there was peaceful commercial and cultural trade between the people of the congo and the europeans but later the dutch and the portuguese began their slavehunting they stripped whole villages of people they stole the riches in the form of goods and art objects they plundered for wealth in whatever form they could get from no european source was there an outcry against these savage acts to the contrary the european scholars clergy kings and merchants proclaimed to all how wonderful it was that they were civilizing the savage congolese those who proclaimed this were called by the prestige title historians but now they are being revealed as mere scribblers surely the greed for quick wealth blinded the eye of the european to justice soon treachery robbery and executions compounded the chaos in the congo violence became the order of the day as various assortments of european mercenaries vied for control of this rich area of africa in the ensuing struggle many of the christian churches built by the portuguese were destroyed not only were the physical structures of christianity destroyed but so was the faith itself when the clergy were silent about the grievous wrongs done to the congolese people they were not successful then in winning the congolese because they were often mere agents of the europeans in their plunder for wealth the congolese wondered why the white clerics were silent in the face of all these wrongs and then turned away from them perhaps these historical aspects have lessons for todays current events then came king leopold of belgium on the scene he was a shrewd business man who had a love for money and the commodities that it could purchase he followed events of his day carefully and knew that europeans had gone to africa for quick riches the time was the middle and late s so accordingly leopold called an international geographic conference of scientists scholars and business men addressing this conference leopold posed as the great civilizer and said to open to civilization the only part of our globe where it has not penetrated to pierce the darkness which envelops whole populations is a crusade if i may say soa crusade worthy of this century of progress before the conference adjourned it set up the international association for the exploration and civilization of africa with this fine cloak as a missionary leopold sent his troops to the congo and took possession of it he then forced each village to pay taxes in the form of rubber and ivory those who refused to deliver their quota of rubber and ivory were tortured by leopolds troops who mutilated bodies cut off hands and separated wives and children from husbands and fathers thus did the great civilizer bring civilization to the congolese people reports of leopolds agents bringing baskets of amputated congolese hands are many during the decade of  to  the need for rubber increased and the belgian kings profits from this item alone were  million dollars this figure does not include the profit made by the american congo company to which leopold had granted concessions the methods of this company to collect rubber were similar to those used by the belgians when todays headlines scream about savage congolese it is well to remember the true facts of history the truth is that the congolese had a fine civilization of their own much before the europeans came to the region the truth also is that the europeans did not bring civilization to the congo they brought savagery in their torture and mutilation of the congolese in conclusion one must certainly ask who were the civilized and who were the savages history that is true history makes the answer apparent in huge letters 
reflecting upon harvey wishs the negro since emancipation prentice hall  i am struck with the fact that the title is quite misleading this is so because the book is not primarily concerned with the negro since emancipation but with the ideas of prominent negro spokesmen since emancipation i believe a more correct title would be the one mr wish uses as a subtitle in his introductionleadership strategy protestfor in the anthology which follows he presents selected works of negro leaders manifesting these elements at certain times in american history as mr wish states     the controversial picture of the passive negro content to let the northern or southern whites decide his destiny and fight his battles simply is not true and is everywhere being challenged of late his selections are from those negro leaders and writers demonstrating this fact and also demonstrating the shadings and differences which existed and do exist among various leaders of the negro movement at any given time in geographically charting these differences mr wish makes something of a contribution to the growing mass of literature about the negro it is generally felt among historians that one has to arrive at historical detachment before one can present a valid history of a trend an era or a culture nowhere is the validity of this theory better proven than in mr wishs book dealing with men and  their ideas of  years ago mr wish is on very sound ground he presents sharp clear illustrative passages from the men in question clearly supporting the points of view with which history credits them the more contemporary negroes are not so easily handled time has not allowed us to form a perspective on these men and mr wish selects passages from their works which may or may not be truly representative of the thoughts and trends they represent i sympathize with the task which mr wish undertook perhaps his choice of men and ideas is as good as any available at this time it is by no means the final word nor do i think he intended it to be however what is rather unfortunate if not unforgiveable is certain errors which occur for example the march on washington is dated august   when in fact it took place on august  later in the book the statement appears that martin_luther_king jr    found a madetoorder situation to test gandhian techniques this is of course not altogether true first the situation found king he did not seek the situation second there is much evidence to show that king at the time of the montgomery boycotts did not have a clear idea of what gandhian techniques if any he would employ despite my criticism of certain areas of mr wishs work i still feel that it is a very valuable handbook to aid in the pursuit of trends in negro leadership strategy and protest from frederick douglass to booker t washington to du bois and down to the present it is short enough to be read with ease and reliable enough regarding early history to make the effort worthwhilebrooks johnson
