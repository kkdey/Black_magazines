on a spring morning in  a reporter from the washington press walked up the long lane of stone steps leading to a spacious home in the d c suburbs bent on seeing frederick douglass although born a slave douglass had become the most prominent negro of the nineteenth century having behind him a notable career as an abolitionist orator a newspaper editor and a holder of such high public offices as marshal of the district of columbia and recorder of deeds for the district as the reporter neared the douglass home he heard tones from a violin coming closer he detected the tune and the tunesmiththe starspangled banner played by douglass himself after presenting his card the journalist stated his business what was mr douglasss opinion on the suppression of the negro vote in the south putting down his bow the negro leader spent the next hour discussing democracy in america the way the negro was treated said douglass in essence was a standing reproach to the principles upon which this republic was founded at the end of the interview douglass picked up his violin and again struck up the starspangled banner he liked to play it so he told the departing newsman this episode was full of meaning like other colored citizens douglass loved his country and he was stirred by the appeal of america as the land of the free how inspiring to live in a nation in which liberty and justice were the birthright of all but did such an america really exist not completely and no one knew this any better than darkskinned americans and so from the beginning they have been in the vanguard of those who wished to make their country as heroic and libertyloving as it has been pictured in patriotic song and story to help make america a beaconlight this was the great enterprise to which colored americans gave their devotion their notable efforts are reflected in a living record that has become a mighty tributary in the stream of american history their contribution dates from their first landings in the new world for they did not come emptyhanded in their ancestral homelands along the bulge of africa they had attained a stable order of civilization in their government the african political systems all operated under elaborate codes of law whether clan state village state kingdom or empire in tribal life the innumerable societies and social organizations were in the main established on the principle of equality thus when the african arrived on the shores of the new world he brought with him a sense of justice and a tradition of abiding by the law from africa too the transplanted native brought his art forms and handicraft skills tribal craftsmen were highly proficient in weaving pottery and carving in wood ivory and bone african craftsmen had been first to work in iron and gold metal forging being one of their oldest arts these natives from across the  atlantic were among the earliest arrivals in the newly discovered americas indeed from  onward they accompanied the spanish explorers on their voyages of discovery when balboa first stared at the pacific he carried  colored workers in his train cortez used negroes in his conquest of mexico one of them found some brown grains in his rations and planted them thus becoming the pioneer grower of wheat in the western hemisphere the most renowned of the negroes who accompanied the conquistadores was estavanico who in  led a party of spaniards and pima indians in search of the fabled seven cities of cibola estavanicos travels took him into presentday new mexico and arizona and thus paved the way for the spanish occupation of the southwest negroes also accompanied the french explorers in louisiana along the mississippi valley and in the great lakes area chicagos first permanent settler was jean baptiste pointe de sable a mulatto originally from haiti whose deed inspired the wellknown quip by the pottawattomie indians the first white man in chickagou was a negro when in  john c fremont pathfinder of the west began a survey of the oregon trail his official party had in its number a colored volunteer eighteenyearold jacob dodson of washington d c the tradition of negroes accompanying explorers was to extend down to matthew a henson who on april   stood at the north pole to witness robert e peary take the stars and stripes and plant its staff in the ice once in the new world the men from africa were given tasks to do in the beginning there were forests to be cleared highways to be constructed artillery to be hauled and boat timber to be lugged over the mountains after the english colonies were established beginning with jamestown in  the negro was employed in the north as a farm hand mechanic and skilled laborer in the lastnamed class were those who practiced silversmithing goldsmithing and cabinetmaking in the south the negro was employed mainly in producing the staplestobacco indigo sugar rice and in the nineteenth century cotton slave labor however was put to other uses than agriculture and domestic service in the old south the slave had a virtual monopoly on the mechanic arts skilled slaves commanded a high price the plantation required a certain speciality in labor houses must be built agricultural implements must be manufactured and repaired clothing must be made for these and other needs of the plantation many trained slaves supplied their skillsamong them the carpenter mason wheelright plasterer weaver shoemaker seam stress tailor and upholsterer distinctive among the skilled slaves were the ironsmiths whose work may still be seen in the balconies grilles and lampbrackets of the homes in the old french quarter of new orleans while most of the colored workers were slaves there were many who were not in  a year before the outbreak of the civil war there were nearly half a million free negroes in the united states this was about one ninth of the total negro population and it was nearly evenly divided between the north and the south but free or slave the labor of the colored man created king cotton and added greatly to the store of american mechanical skill contributing also to the economic development of the united states was the inventive genius of its colored people at the end of the eighteenth century norbert rillieux of new orleans invented a vacuum pan that revolutionized sugarrefining methods jo andersons competent assistance enabled cyrus mccormick his owner to bring to perfection the first practical reaper in  a few years later lewis temple of massachusetts invented the singlepiece toggle harpoon thus enabling whalemen to multiply their catch from the fertile brain of granville t woods came nearly a score of new devices in telegraphy electricity and air brakes in the eighteen eighties elijah j mccoy a contemporary of woods produced a lubricating cup which was widely adopted by railroads and oceangoing ships in the same decade a year old colored mechanic at lynn massachusetts was granted a patent on a machine to last shoes this invention writes a recent biographer of jan earnst matzeliger was to revolutionize an ancient industry and help significantly to lighten the burden of human labor all over the world no less noteworthy than the colored mans economic contribution to america was that of his war services the patriotism of the negro has been well testedhe was never a summer soldier whenever america has been engaged in a war he has offered his services a runaway slave crispus attucks was the first patriot to shed his blood on the eve of the revolutionary war attucks was buried from historic faneuil hall a monument which stands at the scene of the boston massacre commends him and his four comrades in martyrdom long as in freedoms cause the wise contend dear to your country shall your fame extend in the war of  perhaps the most important single action in which negroes participated was that of the colored militia who shared in the famous battle of new orleans the only land victory won by americans commanded by  major general andrew jackson these more than  men of color marched to battle singing their own war song go forward grenadiers he who is dead requires no ration in the civil war  negroes enlisted under the union flag of whom  gave the last full measure of devotion but soldiering was not their only contribution in the north and in the confederacy the brawn and sweat of black men went into many a fortification and gun emplacement one of the many colored women who worked for the day of liberation was the famed underground railroad conductor harriet tubman who served as spy scout and war nurse in world war i more than   negroes bore arms four colored regiments were awarded the croix de guerre in world war ii a quarter of a century later the first casualty of the united states armed forces was a negro robert h brooks of sadieville kentucky who was killed in the philippines the day after pearl harbor in the korean war the colored soldier served in racially mixed units for the first time in significant numbers since the revolutionary war this drumming jim crow out of the armed services was a step which improved the fighting efficiency of americas armed forces a report issued from the office of the assistant secretary of defense entitled integration in the armed services and dated january   made this significant statement thorough evaluation of the battletested results to date indicates a marked increase in overall combat effectiveness through integration through his direct participation in every war since the declaration of independence the negro has substantially contributed to the defense and maintenance of his country another contribution of his one of a different kindis what might be called the gift of the spirit of its many manifestations the one which has made the greatest impress on american culture is the negro song the most remarkable of the songs are the spirituals products of plantation churches conducted by colored preachers these songs sprang up spontaneously they served as a safetyvalve being the negros side of what happened to him but they were more they were remarkable for their power of feeling power of imagination and power of expression of the nearly  of these spirituals perhaps two of the most familiar are deep river and swing low sweet chariot the spirituals are americas only folksong and they now belong to the world of negro origin also are many american work songs negroes who followed the sea improvised boat songs and rowing songs the rhythmic tunes of swarthy stevedores served as a laborsaving device in stowing cotton hoisting sail or casting anchor becoming part of the sailormens stock of songs as they gathered the harvest in the fields colored toilers sang to ease their tasks these plantation strains were destined to survive in railroad and hammer songs like water boy and those clustering around the fabulous john henry using such typical language as this old hammer killed john henry but this old hammer wont kill me with the coming of the twentieth century the vocal music of the negro was diverted into the field of entertainment from negro folksong came another outflowering that of ragtime this music with a ragged time to it was given a twist in theme in  and the result was the immortal st louis blues composed by w c handy one night as he sat in a tavern on a levee street in st louis after  ragtime was rebaptized as jazz and it quickly swept the country its influence soon spread to europe where it aroused the enthusiasm of serious musicians and composers jazz is on its way to becoming the music of the world wrote belgian musicologist robert goffin in  the rhythms used in negro vocal music were much like those used in negro dance from plantation dances such as the juba came the minstrel show with its series of peculiar shuffling steps one of the colored minstrel men was james bland who before he reached twenty had composed carry me back to ole virginny now the state song of the old dominion the dance patterns of the minstrel show gave their stamp to the cakewalk and then later to the charleston the big apple and a host of others the influence which the negro has exercised on the art of dancing in this country has been almost absolute concludes james weldon johnson a student of negro culture just as americas music and dance reflect a negro influence so do this countrys behavior patterns  into the channels of the american spirit the transplanted african has infused his zest for living carl g jung the great swiss psychologist has noted the negro influence on our daytoday behavior what then about american laughter writes he in rhetorical question what about the boundless noisy sociality the pleasure in movement and in stunts of all sorts the loosejointed walk the negroid dance and music it would be difficult not to see that the negro has affected american behavior another negro quality which has become a national trait is the ability to adapt oneself to a society that is never staticthe old order changeth yielding place to new the american negro writes melville j herskovits is characterized  by that resilience toward new experience which in itself is a deepseated tradition of africa such a resiliency well might be the key to tomorrowone who is accustomed to scanning new horizons is not likely to be chained to the fixed assumptions of a day that is dying civilization writes lewis mumford is the neverending process of creating one world and one humanity for such a new cosmopolitanism the american negro is fitted by his physical characteristics his interculturalist background and his resilient spirit if as wyndham lewis suggests the united states has become a human laboratory for the manufacture of cosmic man if van wyck brooks can speak of the planetarymindedness of the american people and if harrison smith can maintain that this country is now producing the first world man then the negro in our midst may claim a modest share of influence this recital of the role of the negro has left out much but it may indicate that the choicest heritage of this land includes the contributions of its sable sons and daughters to the making of america they have given their best and their all the negro finally has played a unique role as a mirror for america a test of this countrys ideals a sort of spiritual barometer from the beginning his presence has raised an important question would america become an oligarchy of the skin or a land of equal justice under law colored americans by and large have never doubted what the answer will be i know of no country where the conditions for the development of liberty and humanity are more favorable than here in the united states so spoke a former slave who was destined to hold positions of high honor in the government of his country and who liked to play the starspangled banner on his violin 
on a hot day in august  a prominent politician entered the white house and paused in the presir office it was dark joseph t mills wrote later and there in a corner i saw a man quietly reading who possessed a remarkable physiognomy the man awed judge mills i was riveted to the spot he said adding i stood and stared at him he raised his flashing eyes and caught me in the act i was compelled to speak said i are you the president no replied the stranger i am frederick douglass  it was an honest mistake frederick douglass was in washington to see abraham lincoln he was not the president but under different circumstances he could have been he had all the giftspresence passion bearing brilliance all the gifts save one he was nonwhite coloran accident of birthbarred him from the highest prize but it did not prevent him from becoming one of the most remarkable men of that or any other age born in the lowest position in society douglass emancipated himself and became an orator an abolitionist an editor a politician a seer and a prophet bom brown and hungry in a society that forbade slaves to read he lifted himself by his own efforts and became one of the great names of an age that abounds in greatness for  years from  to  he was in the forefront of the fight for human freedom during this period he laid the foundation for the negro protest movement although he died  years ago frederick douglass is as current as yesterdays headline one hundred and ten years ago he was staging sitins on massachusetts railroads one hundred and six years ago he was leading a fight for integrated schools in rochester new york one hundred years ago he was denouncing hypocrisy and fraud with prebaldwin fury if there is no struggle he said there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want the rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters this struggle may be a moral one or it may be a physical one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and never will    men may not get all they pay for in this world but they must certainly pay for all they get more important than the eloquence of douglass words was the eloquence of his life frederick augustus washington bailey he assumed the name douglass later was born in february  on the eastern shore of maryland he never knew his father who was rumored to be his master and he only saw his mother five or six times slavery he said once abolished both fatherhood and motherhood as a child he knew the brutality and degradation of slavery he knew hunger and pain and he saw his aunt and other negro men and women whipped till blood ran like rivulets down their backs a stroke of luck sent douglass to baltimore md where he learned at an early age that knowledge is power his mistress wanted to teach him the alphabet but his master forbade it give a nigger an inch he said and he will take an ell    learning would spoil the best nigger in the world listening thinking dreaming frederick came to the conclusion that words were weapons he hid dirty pages in his pockets and when no one was looking he extracted the pages and spelled out the magic words later while still a slave douglass learned that power has its limitations this was an extraordinary discovery and it changed the whole course of his life it happened this way he refused to buckle down to his master and was sent to a  professional negrobreaker who specialized in destroying the spirit of slaves who would not submit to the slave regime the negrobreakers name was edward covey and covey was good at his trade he worked douglass until he was ready to drop from exhaustion and whipped him until he bowed and smiled but wormsand slaves and negroesturn one day douglass tells he turned and made a desperate last stand the two men grappled to an indecisive draw covey stalked off and never afterwards touched douglass from this incident douglass drew a moral which he applied to many situations after he gained his freedom he is whipped oftenest who is whipped easiest four years later at the age of  douglass escaped from slavery in  he borrowed a sailor suit and an officiallooking paper with a big american eagle on it grabbing a train he traveled to new york flashing his eaglestamped paper as he went three years later he joined the phalanx of negro and white men who were waging an intense cold war against slavery white abolitionists like william lloyd garrison and free negroes like charles lenox remond were in the forefront of the movement but they did not have the firsthand knowledge that douglass had and their speeches lacked his concreteness and fire douglass on the platform was a sight to see he was a goodlooking man tall wellbuilt with olive skin and a halo of hair worn long and au naturel in the african style his physical presence moved people so did the rolling thunder of his voice by turns humorous dolorous and indignant he transformed his audience to slave row a master mimic he could make people laugh at a slaveowner preaching the duties of christian obedience could make them see the humiliation of a black maiden ravished by a brutal slaveowner could make them hear the sobs of a mother separated from her child through him people could cry and curse through him people could live slavery white men and black men william wells brown said had talked against slavery but none had ever spoken like frederick douglass within a few years douglass was a household name he traveled to england ireland and scotland was feted by ladies lords and earls his reception was so warm that he was tempted to remain abroad but in an eloquent farewell speech at london tavern he said i choose rather to go home to return to america  i go turning my back upon the ease and comfort and respectability which i might maintain even here ignorant as i am still i will go back for the sake of my brethren i go to suffer with them to toil with them to endure insult with them to lift up my voice in their behalf to  speak and write in their vindication and struggle in their ranks for that emancipation which shall yet be achieved by the power of truth and of principle for that oppressed people so turning his back on ease comfort and respectability douglass returned to america for almost six years he had labored in the garrison vineyard now he stepped out on his own in  he started publishing the north star in rochester new york from that year until the abolition of slavery he was in the forefront of the abolitionist ranks in an age of danger and doubt douglass and other black abolitionists came to grips with dilemmas which lie deep in the negros heart douglass asked the old and insistent question how can i sing the lords song in a strange land the answers revolved around the traditional trilogy ballots bullets or bibles and iagos injunction go make money the followers of william lloyd garrison condemned complexional institutions negro churches lodges schools newspapers and conventions the garrisonians also abandoned political action and advocated a campaign based on passive resistance and moral force after  douglass favored ballots if possible and bullets if necessary he was an opportunist on the issue of complexional institutions he demanded complete integration but if circumstances  made this impossible he unhesitatingly recommended special institutions at stake here was a bitter issue of power douglass was an independent man who felt uncomfortable in a subsidiary role he demanded a share in the generalship of the movement in a statement reminiscent of toussaint louverture he said no people that has solely depended on foreign aid or rather upon the efforts of those in any way identified with the oppressor to undo the heavy burdens ever stood forth in the attitude of freedom douglass believed that he and other black abolitionists could make a positive contribution by proving that negoes were active rather than passive cogs in the antislavery machinery he said that    the man who has suffered the wrong is the man to demand redressthat the man struck is the man to cry outand that he who has endured the cruel pangs of slavery is the man to advocate liberty it is evident that we must be our own representatives and advocates not exclusively but peculiarlynot distinct from but in connection with our white friends douglass famous fourth of july speech is a good example of the passion and brilliance he brought to the antislavery cause speaking at rochester new york on july   he indicated every structure of power in america what he asked to the american slave is your th of july i answer a day that reveals to him more than all  other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim to him your celebration is a sham your boasted liberty an unholy license your national greatness swelling vanity your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless your denunciation of tyrants brass fronted impudence your shouts of liberty and equality hollow mockery your prayers and hymns your sermons and thanksgivings with all your religious parade and solemnity are to him more bombast fraud deception impiety and hypocrisya thin veil to cover crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages    you boast of your love of liberty douglass continued your superior civilization and your pure christianity  you hurl anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of russia and austria and pride yourselves on your democratic institutions while you yourselves consent to the mere tools and bodyguards of the tyrants of virginia and carolina you invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad honor them with banquets greet them with ovations cheer them toast them salute them protect them and pour out your money to them like water but the fugitives from your own land you advertise hunt arrest shoot and kill you glory in your refinement and your universal education yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nationa system begun in avarice supported in pride and perpetuated in cruelty you shed tears over fallen hungary and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets statesmen and orators till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against the oppressor but in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the american slave you would enforce the strictest silence and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse douglass dared to make the ten thousand wrongs the subject of public discourse week after week year after year in the crucial decades before the civil war he went up and down the north warning preaching pleading he and other negro abolitionists played a major role in shaping the crisis which led to the civil war during the civil war douglass prodded the famous slow coach at washington long before lincoln perceived it douglass was saying that the war was a struggle to give america a new birth of freedom long before lincoln saw it douglass was saying that the negro was inextricably involved in the root cause of the war and that the war could not be fought or ended without coming to grips with the meaning of the negro and the meaning of america after the emancipation proclamation was issued douglass turned his fertile mind to the problems of reconstruction he demanded ballots for the freedmen and land and said with impeccable logic that as one learns to swim by swimming the negro must learn how to vote by voting four things he said were necessary the right to the cartridge box the ballot box the jury boxand the knowledge box when the north reneged on its promise and turned the freedmen over to the tender mercies of their exmasters douglass was merciless in denunciation in  he denounced the negros socalled emancipation as a stupendous fraud a fraud upon him a fraud upon the world america he said had abandoned the negro ignored his rights and left him a deserted a defrauded a swindled and an outcast manin law free in fact a slave in this period douglassdespite his denunciationbecame an elder statesman he was named marshall of the district of columbia and minister to haiti but he continued to press the claims of negroes he had one foot in the grave on the day a young negro student came to him and asked mr douglass what shall i do with my life the old warrior pulled himself up to his full height and his eyes blazed with the fury of his youth as he said agitate agitate agitate on a cold gray day in february  the great agitator slumped to the floor in his mansion at anacostia heights washington d c and went to that peace promised all men the legislators of several northern states passed resolutions of regret and the legislature of north carolina adjourned for the day to mark the death of the greatest negro produced in this country at his funeral in washington john hutchinson sang the abolitionist song his brother jesse had dedicated to douglass vll be free ill be free and none shall confine with fetters and chains this spirit of mine from my youth  have vowed in god to rely and despite the oppressor gain freedom or die a few days later the negroes of americus ga held a meeting and voted to contribute to a national fund to erect a monument in douglass honor no people these maids and laborers and cottonpickers said no people who can produce a douglass need despair what does douglass say to us today what can we find in his life to nerve us for the trials in this hour first of alland this is very importantdouglass was a man in the deepest and truest sense of that muchabused word today when there are so few menblack or whitewe need the nobility of  his example douglass knewand we need that knowledge today that to be a man is to be precisely responsible he knew too that manhood is founded on selfrespect and selfesteem frederick douglass did not doubt himself nor did he apologize for his place of birth or the color of his mothers skin he reminds us at an hour when many need reminding that the man who knows who he is and where he is going can move mountainsand mississippi frederick douglass was a man and he was a sensitive man he did not isolate himself from the masses wherever he went the negro went with him he bitterly criticized free negroes and there were manywho were indifferent to the antislavery cause free negroes and slaves he said were chained together and would rise or fall together middleclass negroes who shun and despise lowerclass negroes today would do well to remember his words his mission he said was to stand up for the downtrodden to speak for the dumb and to remember those in bond as bound with me another quality in douglass life that speaks to us today is his commitment douglass was committed he acted wherever he was he sought out the struggle and involved himself in it and he was persistent life in this age was not easy for a white agitator it was impossible for a negro douglass was roughed up by proslavery thugs his right hand was broken he was thrown down steps but he took his knocks and stood his ground it was difficult in this age to find a hall that would let a negro abolitionist use its facilities in rochester new york once douglass took his stand under a tree and began addressing five people by the time he varmed up he had an audience of five hundred frederick douglass was persistent and he was catholic he was a universal man and he refused he said to allow himself to be insensible to the wrongs and sufferings of any part of the great family of man he fought for womens suffrage free speech poor barefoot ireland and the chinese and he opposed flogging in the navy monopolies and capital punishment i base no mans rights he said upon his color and plead no mans rights because of color my objection to slavery is not that it sinks a negro to the condition of a brute but that it sinks a man to that condition douglass realized however that individuality is universality he realized that a man is most human when he is most himself and he made no apologies for raising inconvenient questions when he was rich in honors and money he accepted an invitation to speak in ohio but he warned the sponsors that he did not intend to bite his tongue negroes he said still need the help of all who can say a word in their behalf if i come to you in july i shall bring the colored man with me finallyand this is most importantdouglass was militant he not only told the truth but he also lived it he refused to accept segregation and discrimination he assumed that every door open to a human being was open to him and if turned away he made an issue of it when asked to leave a jim crow car he would refuse to move the conductor usually called assistants who would drag douglass out of the car along with several seats he always managed to hold onto acceptance and transcendence growth and commitment universality and militancy these qualities in douglass life are relevant to our present situation they also explain why mary church terrell considered frederick douglass the greatest of all americansperiod and exclamation point today on the nd anniversary of the emancipation proclamation frederick douglass is central to the negros struggle for as robert hayden has said when it is finally ours this freedom this liberty this beautiful and terrible thing needful to man as air usable as earth when it belongs at last to our children when it is truly instinct brain matter diastole systole reflex action when it is finally won when it is more than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians this man this douglass this former slave this negro beaten to his knees exiled visioning a world where none is lonely none hunted alien this man superb in love and logic this man shall be remembered oh not with statues rhetoric not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone but with the lives grown out of his life the lives fleshing his dream of the beautiful needful thing 
romes negro emperor
only negro ever to sit on the throne of the caesars that his brief reign was completely eclipsed by the infamy of both his predecessor and successor the ruler macrinus followed was caracalla an insane mass murderer under the delusion that he was alexander the great the bizarre creature who succeeded him was caracallas illegitimate son incredible heliogabalus an effeminate teenage boy given to practicing weird religious rites and wearing womens clothes for a clearer insight into the life and career of macrinus it would be useful to comment briefly on the times in which he lived in ad  the year he came to power rome was in a state of decline able vigorous emperor septimius severus had died in ad  and left his two sons caracalla and geta as coemperors but the following year caracalla treacherously murdered his brother and seized power for himself it was the beginning of a grisly reign of terror twenty thousand romans were butchered for the sole reason that the tyrant suspected them of having been friendly to his brother combining extravagance with cruelty caracalla stripped the treasury and levied heavy taxes to finance his wars of conquest ironically some historians have praised him for issuing the famed edict granting roman citizenship to all freeborn citizens of the empire but caracalla was not motivated by altruism roman citizens are liable for taxation and new sources of revenue were forever needed to feed the tyrants ambitions in the last years of his reign caracalla became completely deranged obsessed with the fantasy of being a second alexander he decided in  to emulate his idol by conquering the persian empire he attacked the persians in the spring and by late fall had driven deep into the persian kings domains but he failed to win a decisive victory the persian army no match for caracallas legions waged a scorched earth and guerrilla warfare campaign and by the beginning of winter the romans were exhausted from pursuing a phantom enemy deciding to resume the offensive the following spring caracalla set up winter headquarters in the syrian city of edessa it was during this period of relative idleness that caracallas madness began to show signs of getting out of control always contemptuous of roman institutions he now surrounded himself with a picked bodyguard of the most ferocious barbarians in the empirewild men from the scythian steppes and scottish highlands who dressed in animal skins and painted themselves blue a savage himself caracalla far preferred their company to that of more civilized persons it was in early april of  that caracalla made the insane remark that sealed his doom turning to one of his bodyguards he casually observed that rome was rotten to the core and their peoples would have no trouble taking the city any time they wanted to the silence that followed was a silence of death the lunatic words were heard not only by the barbarians but by four of the emperors top advisers these were admiral marcius agrippa two tribunes of the pretorian guard named apollinaris and nemesianus and the pretorian prefect himselfmarcus opellius macrinus as pretorian prefect macrinus was the second most powerful man in the empire and he now decided that rome could only survive by ridding itself of a destructive psychopath who had lost the last shred of his reason the man selected to assassinate caracalla was julius martialis a soldier who bore a grudge against the emperor for reneging on a promise to make him a centurion the murder took place on april  while the emperor was on his way from edessa to nearby carrhae to worship at the temple of the local fertility goddess noticing that caracalla had dismounted to relieve himself martialis came up behind him and struck him with a small dagger the tyrant died instantly and his assassin outlived him by no more than minutes being despatched by a javelin hurled by one of the furclad scythians in the emperors bodyguard the next few hours were crucial for the plotters for all his cruelty and madness caracalla was tremendously popular with the barbarians who made up the bulk of his army pampered and ridiculously overpaid with funds looted from the people of rome they had never had it so good and determined to wreak bloody revenge for the loss of their murdered hero the situation forced macrinus  to report to a desperate ruse martialisthe only man who could give him awaywas dead the barbarians had no indication of the extent of the plot so macrinus and his fellow conspirators quickly feigned grief and ordered caracalla buried with the highest honors taken in by the plotters show of mourning the soldiers held a meeting to select a new emperor the issue was never in doubt as pretorian prefect macrinus was now the most influential citizen in the empire the legions quickly acclaimed him and the senate on hearing of caracallas death lost no time in following suit on april  of a d  four days after the tyrants death an african negro became sole ruler of a domain that reached from the atlantic to the caspian and from scotland to the nile opellius macrinus was born in ad  during the reign of marcus aurelius his birthplace was the city of caesaea in the roman province of morocco since moroccothen as now was a racially mixed area what historical evidence is there of macrinuss negro origin apart from the incontrovertible evidence of busts and bas reliefs attention should be called to the fact that historians of the roman era continually refer to the emperor as a moor today a moor is simply a citizen of morocco and the designation could include persons of widely differing ethnic back grounds such as browneyed oliveskinned arabs or blueeyed redhaired berber descendants of vandal invaders but to the ancientsand to writers and historians of a period reaching from antiquity to the th centurythe word has another connotation and was nothing more than an oldfashioned term for negro so it is safe to assume that when such ancient roman historians as dio cassius aurelius victor and the authors of the scriptores historiae augustae speak of macrinus as a moor they do so in the same sense as does shakespeare when he speaks of darkskinned othello as the moor of venice as macrinus was of humble origin little is known of his early life somehow he received an education as a lawyer in his native city and was apparently active in litigation involving estates since he first came to rome to take a position as estate agent for fulvius plautianus a powerful figure who served as pretorian prefect during the reign of septimius severus  plautianuss career came to an unhappy end in ad  when he was convicted of graft and put to death for a while it looked like macrinus would share his patrons fate but he was saved by the intervention of fabius cilo caracallas tutor who went to the emperor and assured him of macrinuss innocence severus a stern but fairminded man who detested orruption interrogated macrinus at length and was so favorably impressed with the african that he not only spared his life but gave him the post of traffic superintendent along the flaminian way under caracalla he held several appointments as procurator territorial governor and was finally promoted to the allpowerful position of pretorian prefect and it was this post that served macrinus as a springboard to sovereignty over all of rome macrinuss first task as emperor was to clean up the mess left by caracalla and in doing so he won nothing but praise his initial act was to release a number of men under sentence of death or serving terms of life imprisonment after being found guilty of impiety toward the dead tyrant in most of these cases the alleged impiety consisted of nothing more serious than making slighting remarks about caracallas vaingloriousness or delusion that he was a second alexander along with sparing the lives of these condemned men he restored their inheritances and estates which had been confiscated by the greedy tyrant macrinus also won favor by his modesty so much in contrast to his predecessors megalomania when a grateful senate voted to strike huge silver and gold images of the new emperor he declined the measure on grounds of economy and decreed that no silver image be made of him weighing over five pounds and no gold ones of over three pounds although caracallas memory was detested in rome the soldiers continued to revere him and macrinus did not yet feel safe to attack the fallen despot openly yet in subtle ways he began to downgrade him pleading reasons of economy he threw down a number of caracallas statutesparticularly those made of precious metalsand restored the gold and silver to the treasury then he admitted first privately and then publicly that the war against the persians had been caused by caracallas ambition and lust for glory this statement caused some grumbling in the ranks but his popularity in rome rose to new heights also to macrinuss credit was the tactful manner with which he disposed of a problem created by the presence of caracallas aged mother julia domna widow of the respected severus suspected macrinuss complicity in her sons death and rashly gave vent to her feelings abusing the new emperor in the bitterest terms but macrinus disdaining to take action against a now defenseless old woman sent her a kindly message of greeting and allowed her to keep all her wealth and estates julia domnas rashness was perhaps prompted by the fact that she knew she was dying anyway a sufferer from cancer of the breast she succumbed a few months later  of all macrinuss actions there is probably none that won him more praise than his attitude toward the corps of professional informers that infested rome despising the unsavory breed he coldly refused to publish any of the incriminating documents they kept sending him or forward them to the senate for action the emperors enlightened and civilized spirit was also apparent when he was administering justice to persons accused of serious crimes three senatorsmanilius julius and amenianushad been found guilty of causing the death of a provincial lieutenant governor through giving false testimony but macrinus instead of putting them to death merely banished them to islands he explained his refusal to execute the guilty men on grounds that we should be found doing ourselves the very things of which we accuse them as a civil administrator macrinus was an outstanding success unfortunately his success did not extend to the military sphere shortly after coming to power macrinus as an essential measure cut the soldiers pay back to levels that had been established by severus caracallas reckless extravagance had almost ruined romes economy and macrinuss action was not only statesmanlike and courageous but absolutely necessary but the barbarian soldiers knowing nothing of economics raged against the pay cut and in some garrisons there was open talk of revolt this unhappy situation played into the hands of a dangerous enemyartabanus king of the persians resentful of caracallas aggressions artabanus in the fall of  attacked the demoralized romans near the mesopotamian village of nisibis and inflicted a decisive defeat on them with this victory the persians regained much of the territory lost to caracalla and morale in the legions sank to an alltime low low army morale caused by the pay cut and the defeat at nisibis paved the way for events that led to macrinuss downfall the rebellion against the emperor broke out on may th of ad  at emesa caracallas former winter headquarters leading the uprising was an unlikely quartet composed of three women and a yearold boy the women were maesa julia domnas sister mamaea and soaemis her two daughters and youthful heliogabalus soaemiss illegitimate son by caracalla soaemis was married at the time of her sons birth to an elderly priest named varius avitus but there was no secret about the boys paternity for one thing avitus died of old age shortly after the boy was born second soaemis and caracalla were known to have been lovers and third there was an astounding physical resemblance between caracalla and heliogabalus in a clever propaganda move the women stirred the emesa garrison to revolt by parading heliogabalus up and down the city walls and then exhibiting likenesses of caracalla to accentuate the resemblance between father and son the barbarian soldiers seeing a nearreincarnation of the tyrant they adored eagerly raised the standard of revolt and declared heliogabalus emperor when macrinus heard of the rebellion he ordered julianus a trusted local commander to suppress it but his troops who had been promised lavish pay increases by the rebels mutinied and put julianus to death a similar fate overtook basilanus the governor of egypt who was known to be loyal to macrinus the revolt was spreading and macrinus who was as popular in rome as he was unpopular with the pampered barbarians who had served with caracalla appealed to the senate for support the senate promptly responded and fresh troop levies were sent to the emperors headquarters at antioch on june  of ad  the two armies clashed near a small village some  miles from antioch in a battle that was to decide the fate of an empire unfortunately for the people of rome macrinuss hastilyrecruited conscripts were no match for the seasoned veterans who were fighting not for a cause or ideal but for the return of their privileges overwhelmingly defeated macrinus barely managed to escape the battlefield with his life yet he refused to give up hope shaving his beard and disguising himself as a common citizen the emperor made his way from antioch to the city of chalcedon on the bosphorus site of modern istanbul it was macrinuss intention to return to rome rally the senate and people and organize resistance against the rebels with the capital as his base but this was not to be the emperor was arrested in chalcedon by aurelius celsus a prorebel centurion taken inland to the province of cappadocia and slain by another centurion named marcianus taurus diadumenianus the emperors yearold grandson was also put to death at the time of his murder macrinus had ruled exactly  months on hearing of the emperors fate the senate bowed to the inevitable and recognized heliogabalus as emperor in the four years that followed rome sank to its lowest ebb as the office once held by augustus trajan and marcus aurelius was occupied by a simpering teenager who worshipped outlandish gods wore womens clothes and openly consorted with male lovers had macrinus lived in the heyday of romes greatness he might wellwith his brilliant mind and enlightened spirithave gone down in history as one of the great caesars instead it was the misfortune of this littleknown african to live in a period of decay and to have his reign sandwiched in between those of two of the most loathsome tyrants in history by the third century ad the cancer that killed rome had taken root too deeply and macrinus cannot be blamed for failing singlehandedly to arrest the decline of an empire the contribution to history of romes negro emperor is that he was able during his month reign to bring a brief interregnum of tolerance and sanity to a civilization headed pell mell for suicide
as the white man tells the time it was about three oclock in the afternoon and as he kept count of the rising and setting of the sun it was the th day of june  many long knife pony soldiers had ridden up the narrow valley from the south and only a quick amassing of his warriors and their brave deeds had kept the soldiers out of the village the hunkpapa sioux leaders medicine had been good sitting bull had watched while the young men faced the skirmish line across the valley with pride in their valor he watched the white soldiers break their formation and retreat to the apparent safety of the trees along the river under the onslaught of the combined sioux and cheyenne defenders the great sioux was surprised when the soldiers fled this position and hotly pursued by the warriors rode wildly back towards the south the fighting was nearly a mile away now and some of the squaws and other noncombatant indians had ventured from the village in search of loot or perhaps a soldier gun left behind by the fleeing troopers keeping close to the cottonwoods on the west bank of the little big horn sitting bull rode towards the place where the fighting had been the heaviest others from the village were ahead of him he observed several women and two old men who were busily stripping the clothing from a soldier who had died there as he watched he was brought quickly to attention by a womans startled cry that rose from a spot at the timbers edge about  yards ahead the alarm brought sitting bull at a brisk trot come quickly a wasicun sapa he is still alive the hunkpapa leader dismounted and strode quickly to the scene wasicun sapa was the sioux term for black white man and sitting bull discovered that the object of the squaws wrath and attention was indeed a black white man and the only negro he had ever known the man known to the sioux as azimpi was barely alive he had been struck in the back just below the right shoulder by a rifle ball and upon emerging the bullet had torn a gaping wound in his chest the front of his buckskin shirt was soaked with blood one of his boots was missing and sitting bull could see additional wounds in his leg and foot the great hunkpapa medicine man knelt beside the dying negro and as their eyes met they conversed briefly in the sioux dialect with a quick motion of his arm sitting bull dispatched one of the women to the river for water she returned with a dripping shawl the famous sioux squeezed water from the cloth into a polished buffalo horn cup that he carried at his belt and placed the cup at the lips of the dying man azimpi drank briefly smiled painfully at sitting bull and slumped over dead sitting bull explained tersely to the bystanders he was once one of us i knew him as a good man his woman is a sioux and she will mourn as will the women in our camp tonight there was no more to be said sitting bull remounted and rode back towards the village when he had departed the sioux women quickly stripped the buckskin clothing from the negros body and one of the old men carried away a wide brimmed white straw hat the depredation ended here apparently out of respect of sitting bulls friendly gesture to the dying man they refrained from mutilating his remains and vented their fury by hacking up all of the other bodies found nearby     the above order one of many issued by general george armstrong custer in preparation for his campaign against the hostile in dians in  was a prelude to the final adventure in the life of isaiah dorman passed over by historians and nearly obscured by the deeds of more flamboyant characters who helped to shape the west dorman stands distinguished as a member of his race who gave his life in service to his country during this hectic post civil war period little is known of his origin there are no known photographs of him it is said that he was known to many roving bands of sioux as early as  tribal history indicates that a large black white man was well known and well received in their villages this is borne out by the fact that dorman was known to the indians as azimpi or teat in the guttural sioux tongue the word azimpi meaning teat or nipple sounded much like isaiah traveling with a horse and a pack mule the good natured negro roamed unmolested in the land of the sioux his freedom was his prized possession and he sustained himself by small scale trading and trapping early in  dorman perhaps weary of the roving life or possibly not wanting to be caught up in the seething turmoil that was brewing between red cloud and the whites along the bozeman road ventured into the minnesota country here he took as a wife a young santee woman of inkpadutas band later that year he presented himself and sought employment at fort rice near the present day bismarck in the dakotas with his wife he dwelled in a small cabin at the fort he became known to the officers at the fort as a jovial and easy going individual and completely courageous and trustworthy dorman had supported himself by working as a woodcutter for the post trader but when the post commander and quartermaster learned of his knowledge of the territory and his ability to travel among the indians he was slated for better things on november   he was hired by lieut j m marshall to serve as a mail carrier between fort rice and fort wadsworth he made the  mile round trip only once that year but was to make it and others many more times during the years   isaiah also supplemented his income by cutting wood for the trading firm of durfee  peck and for major charles e galpin at the standing rock agency on september   he was hired by capt henry inman to serve as a guide in the field for the military escort that accompanied the northern pacific railroad engineers in a survey that year he received  per month for this employment a handsome sum in this era upon completion of this duty and by order and authorization of the commanding general of the department by special order  dorman was hired as post interpreter at fort rice at the rate of  per month he received this salary until february  when an overall cutback and reduction in budget caused all civilian employees of the military to be reduced in pay from that time isaiah received but  per month he still supplemented his income by cutting wood for the durfee  peck branch at fort rice due to his size and rugged strength it was said that old teat could cut a cord of wood faster than his helper could stack it it is interesting to note that dorman was a parttime employee of durfee  peck this firm operated by e h hicks durfee and campbell k peck with headquarters at leavenworth kansas enjoyed what was practically a monopoly on the indian and military trade in north dakota south dakota and montana during the years  under contract they supplied cattle hay lumber and wood to both the military installations and indian agencies bonded to the government in the amount of  each year their bond was not accepted in  and they were out of business it was not a failure of the firm to fulfill its obligations to the interior department but its failure to play ball with the corrupt grant administration particularly the presidents younger brother orvil who was pocketbook deep in attempting to grab a share of all of the trading post business in the territories general custer was fully aware of the graft and the grant dealings on the frontier and made it known very publicly that goods earmarked for distribution to the reservation indians in keeping with treaty agreements were finding their way into private markets the result he alleged was that the deprived indians were starving and becoming hostile and in turn fleeing the reservations his allegations were no doubt true however the flamboyant general failed to take them through channels and instead published them through one of his many magazine articles this resulted in custer being hailed before an investigating committee headed by chairman heister clymer custer spoke his piece grants wrath fell directly on his long blonde curls this was on march   just five days earlier campbell k peck had testified in regard to the same graft that had put him out of business durfee  peck was defunct custer was relieved and faced suspension the trading firm never recovered and it was only through the intervention of general alfred h terry who always appeared to be in everyones good graces that custer was restored to duty and allowed to lead his command on the expedition acres of words have been written about custers march into the valley of the little big horn and of the fate that awaited him there it is known that in addition to the enemy that he faced there were those who followed him who were twice as treacherous his civilian scouts and both interpreters isaiah dorman and fred girard were of his own selection following the issuance of special order  isaiah dorman was hired officially by lieut harry j nowlan who at the time was regimental quartermaster of the seventh cavalry his pay of  per month started on may   isaiah was about  years old at that time to him the expedition was not one of war against the sioux but a chance to again see the west especially the land of the absoraka or crow this to him was a vacation from his long confining duties at the fort  at about noon on june   and shortly after leaving the crows nest on the divide between the rosebud and the little big horn custer divided his command shortly thereafter custer and the troopers in his battalion rode into historic oblivion for some reason both interpreters dorman and girard were assigned to the reno colunm with orders to charge the indian encampment from the south acting under orders issued previously the interpreters stayed close to their commander to be near at hand if they were needed acting under the same orders were the leading scouts both white and indian the adjutant and the trumpeter they all made up a mounted mobile command post this was fine on the charge up the narrow valley and when major marcus a reno formed his command in a skirmish line across that valley at the time they was in close proximity to the great indian camp but when reno was pressed by the hostiles or thought he was being pressed and ordered a retreat to the timber along the west side of the little horn this closely grouped entourage presented an excellent target for the multiplying hostiles their fire was concentrated here chief white scout charlie reynolds was killed a well placed hostile bullet splattered the brains of custers favorite indian scout bloody knife in major renos face two enlisted men were killed instantly adjutant lieut benny hodgson was wounded a later wound was fatal and isaiah received his mortal wound reno hit the panic button and after shouting several confused commands fled back up the valley with the remnants of his command at his heels this wild flight that was later deemed by major reno as a retreat to a more strategic position resulted in dorman and other wounded being left to the mercies of the hostiles thanks to recognition by sitting bull dorman probably fared better than the others prior to  the famous cheyenne warrior wooden leg related to his friend and biographer dr thomas b marquis that he had viewed the body of isaiah dorman at it lay in death wooden leg stated that all of dormans cloth ing had been taken but that his body was otherwise unmolested he had not been scalped or cut up like the others who fell nearby this was on june  or in the morning of the day following his death there is no reason to doubt wooden legs story as all of his stories of the battle have been proven fairly accurate it is true that when troopers under the command of generals terry and gibbon came to the relief of major reno one day later the scene had changed at this time it was discovered that dormans body was considerably mutiliated this depredation was probably the parting act of an uninformed squaw or of some cheyenne who was not familiar with dorman no marker has ever been erected over dormans grave he was probably buried at the spot where he fell at the time of his death there was  due to dorman for his services rendered to the expedition after a lengthy search it is my opinion that this debt was never paid it would have been indeed ironic if it had been allotted to dormans sioux wife it is also ironic that the only reference to dormans color was made by major reno in his report of the battle reno perhaps out of ignorance when penning his report did omit isaiahs last name the entry is followed by the words o a great many americans  white ones in particularit seems that the negro has only of late seen fit to protest his position of inferiority in america he has shed himself of submission and taken to militant protestation however the fact of the whole business is that the negro has always in one way or another protested his unequal treatment in america protest is not something that is a unique product of the present active generation of american negroes it is true however that protest by negroes has never achieved the magnitude of the present effort but it is nevertheless important that the present activity be seen as not unique it is important for at least three reasons  the present activity can be better understood in terms of a historical perspective on protest  confusion and in some cases resentment of the white community can be at least tempered by its elucidation and  the negro himself it seems to me may be better equipped to carry on the fight with the knowledge of its existence the rather general belief that the negro passively accepted his position as slave and later as second class citizen is hardly the case lets for a few minutes take a brief look at protest throughout the history of the negro in america probably the earliest vestiges of protest can be seen in the resistance of the negroes to becoming slaves many rather than become slaves according to john hope franklin in his book from slavery to freedonri took their own lives mothers for example are reported to have killed both themselves and their children others refused to eat and starved rather than become slaves this of course was not the case with most but even after becoming slaves many fought running and harassing battles with the slavemaster bloody battles were fought between the negro slave and the white master insurrections were perceived by whites as a constant threat in the south especially where the slave population was close to or greater than the white population franklin reports many slaves ran away indeed this practice was so widespread that both federal and state legislation was enacted to aid their recovery fleeing says franklin was one of the most successful forms of resistance the slaves devised another form of resistance probably the most dramatic was found in the slave insurrections revolts and conspiracies to revolt began with slavery and persisted until slavery was abolished the last being reported in  in henrico county virginia under the leadership of gabriel prosser and jack bowler more than a thousand slaves conspired to revolt they were however exposed by one of their members denmark vesey a slave who purchased his freedom in  led probably the most dramatic of all slave conspiracies over a period of several years he prepared for the revolt gathering weapons and men his movement was aborted by an informant and many of his men were killed the estimates of the number of negroes involved ran as high as  in south hampton virginia the insurrection of nat turner led to the death of more than  white families in less than  hours and a pitched battle with state and federal troops in which more than  slaves were killed in  the operations of the maroons a group of runaway slaves fighting a guerrillatype war with whites terrorized an entire area these groups were a constant source of harassment to the white community and served to lure many slaves to their ranks resistance also took the form of work stoppage and subversion such as destroying crops property and animals the impression of the slave conveyed by such vehicles as the stephen foster musical commentary was far from descriptive of all slaves historians of the  negro have carefully documented the slaves resistance to his status of course many negroes fought in the civil war slaves ran away from the plantation to join the union forces more than  negroes had enrolled in the union army by the end of the war  they saw action in every theatre of operation during the civil war the operation of the underground railroad and the tremendous role of figures such as sojourner truth and harriet tubman are further testimony to the degree to which the negro resisted and protested his station in america so effective was miss tubmans efforts that a reward of  pounds was offered for her head in maryland negro protest did not abate substantially with emancipation with the passage of the jim crow laws in the late s the plight of the negro especially in the south became almost intolerable race riots in both the north and the south occurred during this time the voices of men like frederick douglass were constantly raised in opposition to the treatment of the negro the great migration of negroes from the south is likewise indirect testimony to his protest the character of negro protest took on different dimensions in the th century very early it assumed two divergent directions harold w cruse has stated that negro protest since emancipation has been split with one group directed toward integration and the other antiintegration from this point of view one can construe the booker t washington movement as at least initially antiintegrationist it is important to note that the washington movement although at its inception called for separation had as its ultimate goal the inclusion of negroes into the mainstream of american life washington felt that negroes through uplifting themselves could assume a position of such great value in american society that the problem of civil_rights would correct itself hence he advised brains property and character for the negro will settle the question of civil_rights the best course to pursue in regard to a civil_rights bill in the south is to let it alone let it alone and it will settle itself washington was scathingly criticized by that wing of protest ideology which held that the immediate granting of civil_rights was the only way to realize equality this group was led by w e b du bois who claimed the negro could never improve his position gain political and social equality without fullscale civil_rights immediately for years washington and du bois were engaged in controversy one of the most dramatic in american history now the essential character of this debate centered around the manner in which the negro was to ultimately achieve if at all full participation in the mainstream of american life both of the protagonists were protesting the negros position but they disagreed as to the nature of strategies and tactics to be utilized contrary to popular belief the washington movement was in a broad sense a protest movement du bois very early in the s issued a call for negroes to ban together and present their demands for freedom behind a united front in his statement du bois said the time seems more than ripe for organized determined and aggressive action on the parts of men who believe in negro freedom  du bois and  other prominent negro men met the following summer and formed an organization known as the niagara movement du bois speaking for the movement articulated its aims    we claim the right of free men to walk talk and be with them that wish to be with us  we want the constitution of the country enforced    we want our children educated between  and  race riots of extreme violence occurred arousing concern in the entire population three people mary w ovington william e walling and henry moskovitz organized a conference on democracy and the negro the conference took place may   out of this conference to which booker t washington was not invited grew the national association for the advancement of colored people many of the members of the niagara movement joined the naacp others declined to join because they felt the organization was not bold enough in program the naacp ultimately grew it is commonly known to a position of top leadership in the negro fight for civil_rights it has however of late been seriously challenged on several fronts for its leadership position    the parallel development of the national urban league greatly enhanced the negros struggle for economic advancement especially in the urban areas late in the second decade of the s there arose a movement of such great magnitude that it has never been rivaled in size by any other effort since the universal negro improvement association under the leadership of marcus a garvey became the rallying point for millions of negroes garveys plan was to establish in africa a state to which all american negroes could migrate he felt the negro would never achieve equality in white america and should cease trying and direct his efforts toward establishing an autonomous state in his fatherland garvey lauded everything black and preached a gospel of fierce race  pride he captured the imagination and support of millions of negroes and everywhere his name was a household word garveys program was opposed by the naacp and a running battle ensued ultimately ending in the naacps petition to the justice department that brought about garveys conviction in a federal court imprisonment and later deportation garveys strident militancy was a legacy inherited by the black muslims who likewise advocate separation of negroes from white america unlike garvey however the muslims lay claim to territory in america the religious superstructure of the muslims is a characteristic somewhat different from the garvey movement there is little doubt that the present activity in the negro community is a result to a large extent of the success of the naacp and similar protest groups the supreme court decision of may  reversing the separate but equal doctrine contributed directly to the development of a more militant character of negro protest the story of developments such as tent city the tuskegee gerrymander the little rock school integration birmingham montgomery albany and others are so recent and widely publicized as to need little comment the same is true of organizations such as the student nonviolent coordinating committee the southern christian leadership conference congress on racial equality and others nor is it necessary to elaborate on such people as martin_luther_king ralph abernathy chevine king and others their stories are a part of the experience of most americans i should however say something about a different kind of protest as exemplified by robert f williams in union county north carolina robert f williams for sometime maintained a standing army in this county by army  mean a fully armed detachment of men he fought armed skirmishes with the ku klux klan and state officers the last of which forced him to seek sanctuary in havana cuba williams feels that a militant stand and the willingness to fight will hasten final positive results for the negro negro protest has not been relegated solely to an area of action on the part of organized groups one can see it in the writings of many negro novelists richard wrights books especially the long dream the outsider and black boy smack sharply of protest ralph ellisons the invisible man is a classic work of protest in my own evaluation of course these writers do not exhaust the list of protest writers on the current scene james baldwins prolific pen has raised him to prominence in this vein his recent book the fire next time should be read by everyone interested in this problem in another vein poets have long cried out in protest of the condition of the negro one finds the entire panorama of protest illustrated by the writings of negro poets paul lawrence dunbar for example wrote i know how the caged bird feels     in his poem sympathy or a crust of bread a corner to sleep in a minute to laugh and an hour to weep in ie langston hughes writes beautiful is the night and beautiful are the stars and beautiful are the eyes of my people james weldon johnsons poem now known as the negro national anthem typified another kind of protest on a more vociferous level claude mckay wrote if we must die let it not be like hogs hunted and penned in some inglorious spot while all around us bark the mad and hungry dogs making a mockery of our accursed lot   if we must die let us nobly die    and for their thousand blows strike one deathblow    in a different light the development of jazz represents an aspect of negro protest more recently the development of funky jazz is a reaction on the part of negro musicians in all the history of the negro throughout his stay in america is replete with instances of his protestations they have as has been indicated been sometimes loud sometimes subtle sometimes strained and sometimes clear at imes gentle and at other times violent at times legal and other times illegal but they have been and continue increasingly to be in existence inasmuch as protest is in existence today i feel that i should address myself to the character of the present activity let me first address myself to the organizations presently working to secure civil_rights specifically the naacp it is my acceptance that for sometime now the naacp especially the chapters in the north has been complacent the rather dramatic successes of the legal arm of the movement it seems has lulled the general membership into an erroneous sense of wellbeing in addition the naacp has tended to become a classrelated organization by this i mean that the victories achieved through its operation have for the most part made very little if any difference in the life of the great mass of negroes at the bottom of the social class ladder their efforts have been most beneficial to the middle and upper class negroes additionally the leadership of the naacp has been drawn from the ranks of the middle classes and their program of reform has articulated the needs and desires of the negro oriented to white middle class values it is it seems to me the lower class negro who bears the brunt of the differential race treatment he is the one who is the victim of police brutality of the ghetto mentality of discrimination prejudice and in many cases a victim of the prejudice of middle class negroes now the great breach between the general negro population and the naacp was no more dramatically displayed than in the rapid spread of the sitin movement these movements occurred without the sanction of the na acp although the naacp legal department later extended its support as a matter of fact the sitin demonstrators in nashville were advised against this kind of activity by the naacp
early in  the confederate authorities organized a brigade of free negroes called the louisiana native guard colored to supplement the small number of militiamen who were the only force available for the defense of new orleans against an impending attack by a union fleet commanded by captain david g farragut and a union army under major general benjamin f butler nominally the native guard comprised only volunteers actually most of its members were virtually drafted when the confederate troops evacuated new orleans just before the city was occupied by general butlers army of the gulf these reluctant volunteers allowed themselves to be cut off by the union forces to which they quietly and gladly surrendered during the summer of  butler became aware that the confederates were hopefully planning a counterattack upon new orleans since he had only about  effective troops he rightly feared what might happen particularly if the confederates could secure the help of an ironclad ram capable of clearing the mississippi river of the union navys few gunboats when butler found that he could not hope to obtain any reinforcements from the north he decided as he put it upon africa for assistto call ance with learned former this purpose in view he the names of some  officers of the louisiana native guard and invited them to meet him at his headquarters these men were asked if they would be willing to serve in the army of the gulf and if they could induce other negroes to do the same all of them answered yes to both questions fourteen days later on august   a regiment of a thousand men was organized within a couple of months two more regiments of infantry and two batteries of artillery had been enrolled according to joseph t wilson a member of the louisiana native guard and author of the black phalanx half a dozen regiments could have been formed in the same time if arms and equipment had been available for them the officers of the original or confederate native guard had been negroes up to and including the rank of captain the field officers of the first regiment organized by general butler were white men the colonel and lieutenant colonel of the second regiment were white the other officers were negroes both negroes and whites were chosen on the basis of ability alone as officers of the third regiment the two batteries had to be officered by white men because at this time no negroes had had any experience as artillerymen at first the existence of butlers native guard regiments was not officially recognized by the federal government but they were in fact the first negro regiments to serve in the union army during the civil war if general butlers orders probably issued with his tongue in his cheek had been strictly followed only free negroes would have been enlisted in the louisiana native guard which was unofficially known as the free colored brigade however nobody inquired too deeply about the background of a promising looking recruit and many selfemancipated slaves joined it butlers example of informally enlisting negro troops was again to cite wilsons the black phalanx followed very soon by every officer in command and by the time the presidents emancipation proclamation was issued there were not less than  negroes armed and equipped along the mississippi where in the course of time they often fought against their former masters
when robert frost was on his tour of russia after an exhausting visit to a russian school he came back to the reserved section of his hotel dining room catching sight of a table of arabians and a table of chinese he turned around and went back to his room and ate there thats a bad prejudice of mine isnt it he said this incident reported by franklin d reeve in robert frost in russia reveals an aspect of frostwhich is different from the public image of the genial philosophical sage of american poetry frosts letters in the recent books the letters of robert frost to louis untermeyer and selected letters of robert frost also give views of a different facet of his personality some of the letters reveal the frost familiar to the public he talks brilliantly of poetry he shows a delight in words characteristic of a poet the letters are full of puns and plays on words the letters also disclose what is not so well known to the public and round out and humanize the picture of the man there was tragedy in his family life he was often melancholy and without confidence in his poetry he was suspicious jealous of his fame and shrewd in furthering his poetic career one of his plays on words was on the name of the negro poet and critic william stanley braithwaite he wrote im not very angry with you for what you did to breathweight only i wonder if hes worth your pains perhaps he is we were taught that we must try not to look down on anyone the man whom he called breathweight was influential in the renaissance of american poetry in the early decades of the s as poetry critic of the boston transcript he helped to bring the new poetry to the attention of the public by weekly articles by fullscale book reviews and by an annual summing up of the years work in the field with his anthology of magazine verse for  he was the first to publish a yearly anthology of verse in the united states the series continued until  with a final volume for  containing the best poems of that year and a selection of the best poems in the seventeen previous volumes this series helped the reputations of poets and increased the reading of poetry many poets and poems that later became famous were chosen and poets were proud and excited to be included braithwaite also suggested to publishers the idea of yearly anthologies of short stories and of plays two series which are still in existence today claude mckay quotes a negro historian on braithwaite the most remarkable writer of negro blood since dunbar is william stanley braithwaite who as a writer is not a negro    mr braithwaite has by his literary production and criticism  his poems his annual publication the anthology of magazine verse demonstrated that the negro intellect is capable of the same achievements as that of the whites   when claude mckay was coming into notice he sent some poems to braithwaite who wrote to him that his poems were good but that except for two of them any reader could tell that the author was a negro he advised mckay because of the overwhelming prejudice against anything negro to write and send to the magazine only such poems as did not reveal his race mckay did not take braithwaites advice his own expression was too subjective and personal for him to write without conviction and anyone who read him could tell that he came from a tropical country and was black in her memoirs golden friends i had poet margaret widdemer tells of a party given in honor of braithwaite notable poets and literary persons were there but no negroes she says that she felt too much effusion in the praises given him a sense of strain because of his color it was in the period of braithwaites achievement and influence that frost first met him he called on the critic in boston in his correspondence he shrewdly fed braithwaite facts about himself which could be used in an article later he invited braithwaite to visit him would you come up about now    dont you think we could kill a week walking and talking in  braithwaite selected some of frosts poems for his anthology frost wrote i shall be honored if you will use the poems in your book honored enough if you will use two honored beyond dreams if you will use three braithwaite used birches and the road not taken frost wrote about the book  i havent read braithwaites g d booki got one of the children to read it for me and tell me about it all that saved the fat obstacle from the worst fate that overtakes paper was your name and mine on the flyleaf in a letter written as if coming from someone else to himself frost said love is a kickshaw and dalliance naught but give you a field like poetry that calls to the pulling of wires and the manipulation of ropes to the climbing of every black reviewers back stairs for preferment and you frost are there with a suitcase in both hands    thus in spite of braithwaites fostering of american poetry his promotion of frost and his determination to avoid anything that smacks of negro he is referred to as polluting the letter so that frost breaks off and starts over on a fresh sheet young negro writers who are pondering the question of identity can learn from braithwaites experience 
hie hated the tourists h and times like now out hoeing the corn that would have to see him and suellen and the kids through the winter sourness would rise up in his stomach at sight of the big outof state cars slowing down so that the smooth faces with bright and eager eyes could seecould look their fill arel english walking in the dust scrabbling in a rocky field a man with shuffling step with dull eyes knowing these things to be so knowing them to be eternally so arel english forever doomed to scrabble in a rocky field hoeing corn plodding along in the dust yet must somehow find a standard of comparison so he too in his own mind could feel superior and it was times like now with the big cars whizzing down the dirt road that he was apt to lay down his hoe seized with the sudden notion to go down to little jims cabin and sit a spell the same cabin where he had sat for as many years as he could remember back and where his pappy had set for as many years before though the cabin did not then belong to little jim but to his pappy big jim best friend ive got his own pappy used to say sitting on the wide board porch in the est rocker brought out from tk dark interior of the cabin for the occasion best friend ive got aint that right big jim and big jim sitting solid on the top step would wipe at his black face with a bandana reckon as how thats so mr english reckon as how thats so those were the good days with the dust soft underfoot and the skin of his own hands so pale against that of little jims as they tussled like puppies in the field those were the days with little jims mammy stepping out onto the porch now and again to call out mind yourself now little jim and dont get rough then would come the glasses of lemonade and the cake or the cookies or even the pieces of fried chicken with himself and his pappy eating on the porch without ever crossing the sill because even a puppysize boy knew better than that knew it without asking with a bom understanding that it was one thing to sit on a niggers porch and another to step into his house like the way you didnt wonder why big jim and little jim and his mammy sat back while you were eating and drinking waiting until you were walking the dusty road back home before they took their fill of course now a man grown walking that same hot road to that same cabin painted now with curtains at the window and a plot of grass where once was a broomswept yard but still for all of that a niggers shack now you understood what you once simply knew you understood that the lord had made things to be as they were he had made those that were to ride in the big cars and those that were to walk in the dust and he had made those that were to sit back while a white man ate and drank as he walked the stones of the road burned through the soles of his shoes and the folds of his shirt clung wetly to his back a shirt wet thus dried and wet again so that now the smell of old sweat was strong and rank arel english walking in the sun a man with burning jeet and sweaty shirt a man with rock hard years behind and rock hard years ahead a man who would never have enough of clean shirts or ride in a big sleek car walking thus he suddenly threw back his shoulders and quickened his heavy step ahead around the next bend was the familiar end of his journey that cabin painted now but for afl of that a niggers cabin just nothing but a black niggers cabin and all the paint in the world couldnt do nothing to change that by god within sight of the cabin he slowed his pace walking leisurely chewing a stalk of grass stripped from a clump alongside the road he could see little jims kids most grown now like his own playing baseball in the stubble field alongside the shack and he thought of the bright summers when he and little jim played thus and of the day when little jims mammy called out sharply little jim it aint fitting you should call a young white gentleman arel remember now and dont you forget its mr english i want to be hearing you say he did of course forget that is but not often and soon it was like it had always been little jim and mr english he wondered if that time had come for his own and little jims young ones but he likely wouldnt know unless by chance because while he had loved more than anything on earth to tag his own daddy to the cabin of big jim his own boys could not be driven to come along with him why would we want to do a crazy thing like going down to that niggers shack with you and because he couldnt rightly say never having wanted to ask  such a question of his pappy he let it pass quelling the vague unease that this abandonment of the old ways brought about by telling himself that there was no figuring a young one and no need to try he walked now down the narrow lane to the cabin and up onto the smooth worn boards of the porch little jim he shouted im here from inside the cabin the quick light steps of little jims wife and the door flung wide he isnt here jims gone he pulled up the wicker porch rocker and lowered his bones into its familiar curves ill just sit and wait a spell ella mae he cant stay away forever without he has a bite to eat and its getting on now to that time of day ella mae looked at him she looked him right in the eye i dont know when jim will be back maybe not all night or all the next day or even the day after that bees droned above the climbing rose trellised between the supporting posts of the porch it was the same summer sound that hed heard for as many years as he could remember back but today puzzling on the never before boldness of that eyetoeye look the lazy summer hum in the roses took on a different sound a lonely sound like the loneliness of thinking about things that had once been but could never be again things like the way watermelon tasted when you were a kid things like the cool scrunch of grass between your toes when you would tumble out of bed and step into a sunshine world that was all your own standing there then listening to the old familiar sounds he pushed back the lonesomeness with the hard common sense he always took pride upon he pulled himself up out of the chair and spoke kindly to ella mae well ellamae i reckon youll be wearing out the bend in the road watching for little jim to be coming round it which brings to mind you didnt say where it was that little jims gone to she tossed her shining black head i didnt say but i dont at all mind doing so jim is taking part in a sitin over at trentonville this time there was no fancying no mistaking plain nigger uppitiness he wanted to smash to pound to grind the grinning face into the boards of the porch it was only the immense sadness that such a thing as this could ever come to pass that kept him standing there bound yet to the past by a chain he could not break the door slammed shut and he was alone arel english a man with burning feet and sweaty shirt in his ears the lonely drone of bees only sound now left o f summers past slowly he turned slowly he walked back down the lane back down the road stepping to one side as the big out of state cars slowed up to look with bright and eager eyes then speeded on their way once more like an animal he walked head low suffering dumbly nowhere in his mind the words to explain this thing that had come about hed heard talk of course down at the store or when hed meet up with one of the neighbors down the road and on the radio too times the battery had a new charging but such talk belonged to places far away such a thing as piney creek niggers in a sitin was so far beyond the reach of common sense that he hadnt paid it no real mind at all now and as soon as this was clear in his mind he walked with lifted head and quickened step now it was once more like in the days of his greatgrandpappy when a man must fight for the ways that was rightly his he crossed the stoop of his house and walked into the kitchen suellen was there and a couple of the girls whining words at him as he passed but he paid them no more mind than he did the flies that buzzed round his head in the thick and sticky heat he crossed to the far end of the room where by the fireplace hung his squirrel rifle oiled polished deadly it fit into his arm as neatly was as much a part of him as the muscles that covered his bones walking back through the kitchen and onto the narrow path leading to the big road he gave brief thought to the fact that never had he managed to own a whole runnable car a motor with no axles to fit a body with some vital inward worn past repair but never a car that could carry a man to where little jim was at a sitin over to trentonville but the lord gave man feet to walk upon and unfalteringly he turned his in the way that they must travel the walk to trentonville was long and though his mind was working now as clean and neat as the trigger on his gun he was standing at last on the crowded corner by the trentonville courthouse at a loss as to where to turn not knowing behind which of the brick and concrete walls little jim might be concealed then from among the strollers on the far side of the street the couples young and old walking slowly looking into the lighted windows of the closed down stores from among these men and these women he picked out the neat blue uniform of a city police a police who should know where this sitin was a police who by god instead of mincing along the walk like a dandy at a wedding should with drawn gun be seeking out the enemy preserving the order that the lord meant to be on an earth where he put the birds and the beasts and the blacks and the whites and those meant to ride and those meant to swallow the dust of those behind the wheel a policeman prancing in glittering shoes and sharp pressed pants while niggers turned the world topsideto and black wenches slammed doors in the faces of their betters  a fool this police but surely with the sense to turn a man in the direction he must go he crossed the street he opened his mouth to speak the opening coming ahead of the choosing of just the right words so that he was standing there so still silent when the city police spoke to him reaching out at the same time to touch the coldly shining barrel of the gun dont you hillbillies know better than to go parading the streets with a rifle in your hands arel english white male who by god put on his pants one leg at a time the same as any other man standing now on this corner knowing that for all of these things he is still as the lord made him to be a walker in the dust a man who will now shuffle his feet look down at the concrete and whine i dont aim to cause no trouble a cunning man a man who knows it was the lords own hand that stayed him from blurting out the true purpose of his mission and caused him to say instead i dont aim to cause no trouble i just brung this old rifle in town to get the barrel blued and im right now on my way back to where i live up piney creek see that you get moving we dont want no disturbance around here from the likes of you arel english a man to speak meekly no sir a fawning grin you wont have no disturbances from   me he was pleased it wasnt the first time a man had to bow down before he could stand up straight and hed handled it well that he had hed find this sitin then theyd see who was the likes of who black niggers needing to be put in their rightful place and cowards in law suits who made light of honest whites but as the hours and the miles passed by the pavement became hard beneath his feet an unfamiliar hardness trying to a man accustomed to the familiar rocks and dust of his own dirt roads and the brilliant windows with nowhere a spot of restful dark and the people the staring people in cars walking standing just standing staring tourists all and in all the world nowhere a soft chair nowhere a soft voice to say everything is fine mr english just as fine as it can be he walked until there came a time when the lighted windows were farther between less brilliant illuminated by single fly specked bulbs and these people whom he now saw standing and walking were not tourists these were kinfolk walkers in the dust though their feet might never know other than the harshness of a concrete walk and now for the first time he felt close to that for which he searched behind one of these paintscarred doors up one of these unlighted alleys was where he would find them dark figures plotting destroyers of order here was where he would find them here was where he would find little jim and for the first time that day his heart swung high his grip on the rifle tightened and he thought once more of the lilylivered cop who had touched the barrel of that same gun in scorn a cop too craven to do his duty so that a man hillborn must pick up his own weapon to see that justice be done he might too expect some trouble from such a meeching city cop as this but it wouldnt amount to much couldnt amount to much because no matter how you sliced it they was still niggers just niggers why he could remember his own pappy sitting on the back stoop smoking his pipe and talking take jess harkins he was a real outlaw six men he gunned down in his life not counting niggers of course not that he himself exactly held with that little jim used to be as good and as honest a nigger as ever drew breath and he used to like little jim he surely did and the thought of having to gun him down with no more count made of him than if he was a dog didnt seem right somehow but a man did what he must and in those days of which his pappy spoke a man knew too where he stood and he stood there by god with no damned foolishness about equal rights in a world the lord had plainly set up to be as it was on he walked and now he came to a place where there were no lighted windows at all vast buildings warehouses and factories and machine shops stood darkly silent and his footsteps alone echoed into the night somewhere he had missed somewhere behind was that for which he sought doggedly he turned and turning saw beneath the light reflected from a comer post a nigger black as the ace of spades a big buck carrying in one hand a flashlight and wearing a uniform and pinned to the pocket of his shirt by god reflecting the glow of the street light a badge not a star like a sheriff or a city police wore but a badge no mistaking that arel english male white taxpayer and great greatgrandson of a piney creek taxpayer standing now at close to midnight on a lonely city street seeing what hed always known was just tall tales and not really so at all seeing now with his own eyes a nigger with authority pinned to his shirt this then was it calmly he raised his gun and his voice was sharp as the crack of a bullet you boy come here he came moving easily speaking softly are you crazy put down that gun oh his little tin badge had gone to his head all right arel english looked close read the word security guard and he a man grown wanted to weep that such a thing as this could come to pass he liked niggers wasnt little jim the best friend he could have had as black as the pit of night and if it would do any good at all hed say now just put aside that badge boy and those uppity airs youve taken to wearing with it this was what he wanted to say and the surety that it would be no use brought hot tears to his eyes so that as his finger tightened on the trigger he could only fire blindly at an enemy nameless faceless and without form arel english standing now alone a chill in the marrow of his bones standing with useless rifle knowing now knowing at last that it would do no real good were he to fire thus ten times ten straight into the heart of little jim arel english walker in the dust standing alone in a quiet street listening for a soft black voice listening to hear the words everything is fine mr english just as fine as it can be
i has long been my contention that if white america knew the true facts about the negro and his place in american history as contrasted with the diabolical myths of the stereotype negro and his happiness as a slave under kindhearted masters for whom he gladly labored and sweated from sunup to sundown in the cotton fields of the southland and sang jubilee and folk songs into the late hours of the nightsuch as white america and negroes too are taught in american text books if america learned from their school books of the negros remarkable contributions to american freedom and progress from accurately recorded history books in american schools the american conscience would be stirred and awakened by this powerful moral imperative the security of america rests upon our actual knowledge of the past events that have occurred in our land and the enlightened use of this knowledge in constructive thinking about our plans to create a better life for all americans in the future this becomes all important today in connection with the implementation of the wide benefits to be derived from the new antipoverty program recently enacted into law the rejection in teaching such myths and caricatures mentioned above is supported    by the best of current historical scholarship the degrading of a whole race of people the negro by such derogatory references is attributed to the deference of textbook publishers to the special sensitiveness of the southern market what a pity that a whole race of people americas largest minority of   souls must suffer this disgrace to appease the benighted vanity of the most backward section of america the total national strength of america is directly related to the maximum of unity of all classes and races in america whatever their color religion ethnic origin or nationality background it is therefore clear that to degrade one group at the expense of all others is damaging to the general welfare of all america to solve this problem is to promote the general welfare of americaand each group cultural democracy is an important inescapable corollary of political and social democracy and it involves an open door and the full acceptance of minority contributions and for the full recognition of the minority contributors one of the most important projects which the negro must support perhaps second only to the long and bitter battle for civil_rights  which now appears as far as the written law is concerned as a fait accompli is to correct the mind of the average american child and adult about the place of the negro in american history and his contributions to our history as a nation and at the same time to destroy once and for all the myths and stereotypes that haunt the life of the american negro many of these myths and stereotypes were in the most part figments of the white mans imagination created by propaganda and maintained as a balm for a guiltladen white psyche dr elias blake jr of howard university has written with great clarity on this subjectsee journal of negro historyapril  on the subject of the negros singing and dancing and his socalled irresponsibility dr blake says negroes did sing a lot but song was a physical life saver and a codified weapon against a deadly power structure they did dance but as a diluted expression of a former african cultural heritage which was brutally destroyed in all its major aspects there was irresponsibility but as a clever device to escape back breaking labor    one of americas greatest historians and the leading authority on the history of the american negro was dr carter g woodson who after authoring singlyand in collaboration with other distinguished scholarsmore than  scientific works on the negro died in washington d c on april    born of former slave parents in  in new canton virginia he suffered all the hardships and privations of one of several children in a tenant farmers family he left virginia at the age of  and went to work in the mines of west virginia after obtaining the degree of litt b at berea college in kentucky in  he taught school in west virginia in the philippines the high schools of the district of columbia and later became dean of the school of liberal arts at howard university his search for more knowledge led him to the university of chicago where he was awarded the degree of ba in  and ma in  he then studied at the sorbonne in paris his superb work in research on the history of the negro in america was accomplished during his two years of study at the doctoral level at harvard university where he was awarded the phd degree in  following years of foreign travel and further research he became convinced that among the scholars of the world and more sadly among negro scholars and students of history the role of his own people in american history and in the history of other nations cultures was being either ignored or deliberately misrepresented he therefore delved deeper and deeper into the neglected past of the american negro he founded with others the now famous and world recognized association for the study of negro life and history asnlh in september  with headquarters in washington d c it is one of the great honors and pleasures of my life that dr woodson whom i knew from my childhood and deeply respected urged me during my student days at harvard when he visited frequently as guest lecturer and summer visiting professor to establish a philadelphia chapter of this association this i did in  and became its first president this chapter under the present leadership of miss edythe h ingraham a supervisor in the philadelphia school system is one of the leading branches of asnlh in america at present as a member of the national executive council of the association it is my task with a board of distinguished historians  and educators to see to the furtherance of the great historical objectives of its late highly respected founder the president of the executive council is dr charles h wesley noted educator and president of central state college in wilberforce ohio the secretarytreasurer and editor of the informative an widely read popular monthly negro history bulletin is dr charles walker thomas a noted scholar and professor of history at howard university washington d c the editor of the scholarly quarterly journal of negro history founded in january  is dr william m brewer an eminent scholar in the field of american history and the history of the negro in the cultures of many nations of the world the journal has never missed a publication date an impressive volume handsomely printed and bound and acknowledged to be the first and last resort of scholars throughout the world for accurate historical data on the american negro and his influence in the social political and economic history of america slavery as we all know had its beginnings in america when a dutch trader landed his vessel with twenty  native africans in jamestown virginia in  these humans the robust survivors of a much larger number who left the shores of africa two months earlier were sold as slaves to the virginia planters stories of their huge size their strength their friendly nature and quick acclimation to their new surroundings are now well known neither time nor space will permit a full discussion of the growth of this blot on the morals and conscience of the civilizations of europefrom which continent trading vessels were sent by the dutch the spaniards the french english and portuguese to the east and west coasts of africa in the commercial exploitation of human lives they invaded peaceful native villages and captured by force and violenceand if that failed by corrupting their own tribal chiefsdefenseless men and women these frightened people were torn from their children and loved ones and driven off in chains to slave vessels within these vessels many hardly seaworthy this human cargo was crowded into pens like animals to make the hazardous six to eight weeks voyage across the atlantic to a completely strange and unknown land it hardly need be said that records show that rarely more than half the human cargo survived this dreadful passage the earliest and perhaps the most renowned negro scholar of all time who scientifically and painstakingly studied and recorded this subject was the late great philosopher essayist historian and critic dr w e burghart dubois who died in  at the age of  in his monumental and scholarly book suppression of the slave trade edited by him when he was rogers memorial fellow at harvard university from which institution he earned his phd degree in  dr dubois with painstaking analysis supported by records from the house of commons house of lords archives of various state governments in america as well as studies of treaties between various foreign governments relating to the slave trade says while the exact proportion of the slave trade to america can be but approximately determined records show that from  to   ships left africa with a cargo of  negro slaves and after losing  on the passage       were delivered to america and that  slaves were brought to america each year from  to     later this figure rose to  per year the census of  showed  slaves in the united states dr dubois in this well documented book gives the accurate slave population in each of the states in colonial america including the new england states unfortunately little is known of the descendants of these unwilling migrants to our shores by the school population of america and as it follows by their parents certainly the american school books tell us virtually nothing except that the leading negroes who have risen to a place of prominence in america are booker t washington frederick douglass sojourner truth the great oratorabolitionist and marian anderson only recently have they added the name of dr ralph j bunche american history books never tell of the   negro soldiers and  negro sailors who fought in the civil war it goes without saying that these books geared to the sensitiveness of the south never mentioned the heroic deeds of the trusted slaves who defying death harbored the women folk and children of their masters who were at war and saved many families from death and the tortures of war nor says dr woodson in his volume negro makers of history no american school book tells its students that  negro soldiers and four negro sailors won the congressional medal of honor for bravery and valor during the civil war nor do they tell us of the   free negroes in the united states at the time of the signing of the emancipation proclamation on january   more than half of whom were in the south and thousands of whom were successful businessmen in both the north and south nor do they tell us of the prominent role of the negro runaway slave crispus attucks in americas first birth of freedom this exslave then living in boston was the first american to defy and the first to die in the revolutionary war he repelled the british infantry on the boston commons in the famous boston massacre on march   it was the shot from attucks rifle that sparked the flames of the revolutionary war which ended successfully six years later in victory for the rebellious states and their union into the great nation that is ours today there were at that time one million negroes nor does history tell of the   former slaves who fought under general george washington during the revolutionary war nor does history tell of the  negroes who rushed to the union army immediately after lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation and who saw active service many of these men were killed and wounded and in addition to these fighting soldiers another  negroes served as military laborers and  served with the naval units of the north few if any of the history books tell the american students that in the postbellum or reconstruction period twentytwo negroes served in the congress of the united states and two of this number served as united states senators from the point of view of current history this is interesting to note because these two negro senators were from mississippi they were senators hiram r revels and blanche k bruce who contrary to the writings of southern historians were well educated cultured and highly respected gentlemen who left scholarly records in this great legislative body of equal current interest is the fact that three congressmen were from alabama benjamin p turner james t rapier and jeremiah huralston all of whom served in the  rd and th congress in addition every state of the solid south saw negroes in both houses of their legislatures and in many of the cabinets of the state government during this period the highest state office to which a negro was elected was that of lieutenant governor of louisiana this honor went to the honorable p b s pinchback who for a time served as acting governor of that deep south now hardcore segregationist state on the whole these men all of whose biographies and pictures appear in dr woodsons negromakers of history were easily the equals of their white associates in congress and the state house many of these officials exceeded in training culture and talent that of the vardamans and the cole bleeses of those daysand would rate head and shoulders above the talmadges of georgia and the eastlands of mississippi of today as a single illustration senator hiram r revels of mississippi a native of north carolina the first of his race to serve in the senate was born a free negro he went to illinois and graduated from the famous knox college in that state he taught high school in indiana illinois missouri and kentucky he later studied for the ministry and began his church career in baltimore maryland when the civil war broke out he organized two maryland regiments and himself volunteered in the union army as a chaplain after the war he went to mississippi to establish churches and made his home in natchez he entered politics and was elected alderman in  later he entered the race for the united states senate and was elected senator from mississippi in  it was paradoxical and providential that the man whose seat this respected brilliant negro took was none other than the former presi dent of the confederacy jefferson davis the first appearance of this tall handsome negro in the senate chamber for confirmation was a moment of great drama and excitement it took two full days of heated debate on the floor of the senate before the senators agreed to seat this new member finally they gave in and seated the gentleman from mississippi by a  to  vote erroneous myths passionate and vicious dogma and hate have unfortunately taken the place of historical fact and calm analysis hopefully we feel that the struggle of the negro to overcome the nations moral lag is now reaching the twothirds of the american population whom we like to think have not cared simply because they have not known i too like martin_luther_king have a dream    that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed and that the moral scurvy that has nauseated the intellectually courageous white americans for all these long years will be a thing unknown in the not too distant future carter woodson had an awareness of the need of the negro to know himself and of the selfsufficient sophisticated white man to know his america better he was exceptional perhaps unprecedented he made negro history irresistibly attractive indeed classically respectable his dissent from the orthodox teaching of the history of the became woodson the herobecontribution of various racial and cause his dissent from orthodoxy ethnic groups in america was will become the majority opinion heresy but woodson the heretic of historians tomorrow
in those long ago days lagos was an insignificant trading post and the center of power trade and commerce in this part of africa was benin city the flourishing trade of benin affected every town village and hamlet for hundreds of miles around it and was in part responsible for the crisis of kabbo the crisis began on the fifth night of the war with umia village the war was not going well and the services of every man of kabbo were required all the men were at the war camp except segun this was a criminal act of treasonable proportionsparticularly since segun had ignored two messages ordering him to report to the camp hence on this night the horrifying third warning appeared this was a detatchment of men from the camp who surrounded the evaders house torches in hand ready to burn his house to the ground only once before in the history of kabbo had the third warning been necessary that was in the war with eyo village when osagie did not show for the fight but when faced with the flaming torches he fell on his kness bathed his face in the dirt and begged for forgiveness and a chance to fight after joining the camp he fought more bravely than any other warrior and returned to kabbo with three human heads to his credit the six men at seguns house held their torches menacingly ready as their captain issued the final order segun son of bata he shouted loudly authoritatively and ceremoniously kabbo is at war join us at the camp having said this he awaited seguns response the men relaxed on the torches somewhat expecting segun to prostrate himself before the captain as osagie had done thereby relieving them of the responsibility of using the torches but instead segun stood statuesquely in front of his house fearless before his tormentors and gave the response that created the crisis this war is unjust i will not join when the captain recovered his composure he gave the predictable order burn his house down the five men with torches approached the house slowly and hesitantly at first shocked by their part in what was obviously a new script in the making and then they burned the house down the dry thatched hut made a high flaming inferno and when the blazes reached their peak the captain and his men returned to the war camp segun stood and watched his house burn the light of the fire silhouetting his tall frame and broad shoulders he gave the physical appearance of the man who gets things done yet he made no effort to save a single belonging he just watched remorseless and determined to persist in this overpowering conviction and as he watched the final flames die out he knew that this was not the end of the ordeal but rather the beginning the war lasted another week after some fierce fighting the villagers of umia were subdued and  the warriors of kabbo were victorious once more as some of the war captains had expected the booty gained in the victory was richly rewarding the goods cattle and slaves were divided among the victorious warriors as was their custom and all of kabbo then turned its attention to the nasty affair of the segun case in kabbo trials of cases and disputes could be heard and decided anywhere from the lowest bush shed to the kings court the highest court excepting the kings was called the council of ogodis this court was convened only in cases of high treason and when the death penalty was expected so as to spare the king of such gruesome decisions the court was composed of five ogodis keepers of the kings conscience each dressed in an ankle length white robe with his identity hidden behind the large carved wooden mask covered with long dry grass skirts under the chin the net effect was to give the appearance of a ghost with a black wooden head and footlong beard the five of them carried beaded walking sticks that set up a nerveracking jingle as they moved about the court of ogodi was always held in an open clearing in front of the shrine of agboho a roomsize hillside cave the shrine of agboho was the repository of all wisdom and only the ogodis ever entered it was said that if any other person entered he was beheaded by the spirit of agboho and his or her body was buried in the cave with this went the secret of agboho which was the true identities of the five villagers who adorned the masks and became ogodis woe unto anyone who ever referred to an ogodi in court by his true name for this was taken as proof of their having entered the shrine which was the only source of such knowledgesuch offenders suffered the same fate of one who had physically entered on the day of seguns trial villagers gathered at the site hours before the court would convene the place was as noisy as the market with everyone arguing the merits of the casesome defending segun others damning him then at the deafening sound of the cymbals from out of the shrine signifying the ogodis were about to come out the crowd hushed and the silence was as pervading as the sound at this signal the oldest man in the village who acted as an overseer to the court rose to announce the opening of the court be civil be quiet be dumb he shouted repeating the traditional court convening speech for his sixtyfifth time let the cougher conceal his cough let mothers quieten their babies let everybody close his mouth the cord that binds humanity is broken the cord which ties friendships is cut the cord of family and relations is broken the big men now will tie up the broken cords and if anyone disturbs them in this work of reorganizing such disturber will be seriously dealt with the moment he finished the loud cymbals from the shrine clanged again and then from the mouth of the cave came the ogodis at the first sight of them every man women and child in the audience dropped to his or her knees touched the ground with the forehead and remained in that position until the last ogodi walking stick ceased to jingle signaling that the ogodis had taken their seats on the five stools placed immediately in front of the shrine to the left side of the ogodis sat two men the kiri chief of war staff who would act as prosecutor and the captain he dispatched to summon segun to the war camp to the right of the tribunal sat segun the defendent and bisi his lifelong friend and now his defender the leading ogodi opened the session as in tradition by pounding his cane against the ground pointing his finger at the kiri and shouting who are you at this cue the sitting kiri bowed low till his face rubbed the ground and answered i am the dirt at your feet fatheri am the shell of your lowliest kola nut    it was the tradition that one pleading a case before the court should present himself in the humblest of terms hopefully gaining favor of the court through such flattery after all the humble remarks were finished he identified himself as the kiri of kabbo and speaker of the people in this dreadful case the leading ogodis next standard question was do you know me as if this established the impartiality of the court you are beyond knowledge father the kiri explained i can not know you with the prosecution formally introduced the leading ogodi now turned to segun and bisi stamped his cane and shouted who are you segun respectifully touched the ground with his forehead and answered i am segun son of bata this was the first time in the history of the court that a defendant did not humble himself before the ogodis chills of horror swept through the audience some of whom expected the leading ogodi to behead such a brash offender immediately without benefit of a trial after some hesitation the leading ogodi asked do you know me then in the same cool and dignified manner segun answered i do not know you the leading ogodi turned again to the kiri and his captain and asked what is the complaint against this man father the kiri began his case i am the kiri of kabbo this man next to me is my captain and that man he pointed at segun is an ablebodied man of kabbo it is the honor and glory of every man  of kabbo to fight in defense of hearth and home and the country that gave him birth in the recent hostilities against the wild beasts of umia who slaughtered a son of kabbo without provocation this man endangered the success of our mission by refusing to fight of this i accuse the leading ogodi then turned to segun and bisi and asked who will defend this man father bisi began his defense i have fought in two wars with this man seguni know he is no coward and if he refused battle it was because of serious mental reservations and these reservations ought to be considered it is true that he refused to fight in the campaign against umia so let us hear his case with this introduction bisi proceeded to review the case from seguns point of view some zealous war captains of kabbo came to know about the strangers in benin called whitemen who were paying fabulous prices for common slaves these hawks of their day contrived a crisis with the village of umia over the justified killing of a kabbo village bum for the sole reason of enslaving its population and making themselves a large profit from the sales after presenting their case bisi reminded the court that kabbo had always honored men of integrity and that the implications of this case went far and beyond the fate of one man at this point and for the remainder of the trial each ogodi would take turns in questioning the complainant and the defendant until they were satisfied that they had all the facts then they would retire to the shrine to make their decision only the leading ogodi would again appear to announce the verdict the first ogodi inquirer asked the kiri was this a just war father the kiri began his reply kabbo has never gone to war without the sanction of the oracle the oracle of kabbo was consulted and gave its blessings no war blessed by the oracle can be unjust then you the same ogodi said to segun why did you say this war was unjust father segun began we have farmed the land next to the village of umia for ten years without conflict the umia farmer who slew this son of kabbo said the kabbo man ventured without authorization onto his property raped his junior wife and took some of his prized yams he said he slew the man on umia land but that the kabbo war captains who reported the incident dragged the body over the boundary to kabbo land in order to distort the truth of what happened this umia man said that he showed the trail of tracks and blood to a kabbo farmer but at the hearings on this incident the kabbo farmer was forbidden to testify though offered an opportunity to rebut the kiri would not reply to seguns statement so the next ogodi began his questioning you he shouted at segun why do you think the war captains would want to wage an unjustified war with umia father we all know that umia is weaka defenseless prey we also know about the whitemen in benin who are paying high prices for slaves since they have come to this land wars amongst tribes and villages have increased fourfold it was previously our custom to take from the defeated village only sufficient slaves to fill our own labor shortagesbut now we take the largest number of slaves possible for sale to the whitemen of benin this is why the war captains devised this war with umia we have always sold slaves to other tribes the ogodi commented so why is it so bad to sell slaves to the whitemen when we have sold slaves to other tribes in this region we have known what the fate of those slaves would be segun answered we knew for example that any slave who is brutally treated by any master may appeal to the masters king and if his allegations are proved he may be set free we also knew that the children of a slave mother are born free and will share in the inheritance of that household equally with the masters children but when we sell slaves to these whitemen of benin all we know is that they are loaded on huge ships that are swallowed by the sea we know no more you have stated before this day that dealing with this whiteman would lead to kabbos destruction the third ogodi said to segun how can this be so father this whiteman will never be satisfied until he has brought us all under his controlperhaps by buying us few by few one from another he will make us his serfs he will boss our land he will take our crops at this point there was hooting and sarcasm throughout the audience this man must be mad some said a few white men defeat the mighty kabbo another asked we are men we are strong we are powerful the ogodi told segun so how will a few whitemen do this to us father we are men and we are strong segun explained but their weapons are more powerful than ours surely you have heard what they did to the village of alero when it refused to pay their taxes the time is short before they will advance to menace kabbo ha ah this is nonsense the ogodi shouted back at segun many in the audience joined him in a vitrolic slandering of the defendants name when the leading ogodi finally restored order to the court he motioned the other ogodis to follow him back to the shrine as they began to leave their stools it became apparent to segun that i  what they were about to deliberate on was not the merits of his case but the question of his sanity i am not sick segun shouted as the last ogodi disappeared i am not sicki am trying to warn you then when he looked around at the audience almost all of them were pointing to their foreheads with their right index fingers the gesture meaning that he was insane ogodi deliberations frequently lasted all night and many spectators would stay until the early morning hours to hear the life or death decision but this decision took only a few minutes they decided that segun was insane tradition forbade them to take the life of an insane man for this would bring a terrible curse to the village so they decided that instead they would sell segun into slavery so it fell on segun to suffer the horrible fate he had risked his life to condemn before day the following morning segun was bound and gagged for the forced march to benin he along with the slaves from umia had his arms closely drawn together behind his back by means of a cord tied tightly around just between his shoulder and elbows the gag consisted of a wooden bit forced into his mouth and tied around the back of his neck a chain supplied to the warriors by the whitemen in benin connected the knots in the gag to the arm cord and chain tied him to the slaves in front and behind him in this manner the long line of slaves would make the journey to benin bisi seguns unsuccessful defender and lifelong friend stayed with him right up until the bit was shoved into his mouth the last thing segun said was i am not afraid i am not bitter though i know i will never see this land again i still have the feeling of coming back bisis last words were you will come back for i met a warrior who has taken many slaves to benin and he has seen white men who left with slaves come back to benin you will come back too segun i know you will come back two hundred years later  the village of kabbo was still pretty much the same as it had always been there were lots of explanations given for kabbos stagnation some said it was because none of the britishbuilt roads came to kabboothers said the village was permanently cursed but for whatever the reason everybody in modern kabbo was convinced that now kabbos stagnation would end and they would soon be catching up with lagos and accra this was because the peace corps was coming to kabbo the peace corp they were told would not only teach their children but they would also lead the village in a general uplifting community development scheme there would be new roads more sanitation better housing and more effective farming methods this was the reason why the whole village turned out for the saturday morning feast to commemorate the arrival of the very first peace corps volunteer the first volunteer was to be james thomas thomas was born in alabama and was tall with broad shoulders and gave the physical appearance of the man who gets things done at the first sign of the jeep grinding up the little muddy bush path from the main highway the children ran to the picnic grounds shouting he is here the american is here with this notice all of the villagers including its first citizen the yearoldmr okeke called old man okeke behind his back adjusted their robes so as to look their best they were ready and beaming when the jeep pulled up amongst them and thomas got out after a slightly embarrassing moment of surprise and silence old man okeke reached to shake thomas hand with one hand and placed his other hand over the blabbering mouth of the child that stood next to him the child was saying ah the american is black after the handshake old man okeke made a toolong welcome address then offered thomas the heart of the roasted lamb thomas had been told that the honored guest always got the heart of the cooked animal and was expected to eat it with vigor to show his appreciation thomas munched heartily on the lamb heart wishing he could have had old man okekes leg of lamb instead and thinking through the speech he was expected to make at the end of the meat course of the feast when it came his turn to speak thomas said mr okeke citizens of kabbo i am delighted to be joining your village and i am confident and hopeful that our association will be mutually rewarding  instead of indulging in a lot of tmproudtobehere platitudes thomas continued i think id prefer to tell you why i joined the american peace corps and why i came to africa first i joined the american peace corps because i have an overriding concern for the fate of my fellowman   as thomas went on to spell out his concern for the fate of others old man okete who stood next to him became visibly nervous he kept fidgeting and looking at the ground never into the face of the guest i came to africa thomas went on because i have a special personal interest in africa as you can see he added humorously pointing to his black skin my forefathers came to america from africa i can not tell you from what part of africa he came but it could have been from any part it could have been from right here in kabbo as incredible as that may seem with that last statement old  man okete really started shaking most of the villagers thought it was just his oldage nervousness but dr williams kabbos schoolmaster knew better thomas ended his speech old man okeke shook his hand again this time not looking thomas in the face then the old man left the grounds dr williams overtook him a few yards down the path what in the world was wrong with you then he asked old man okeke what made you so nervous old man okeke paused that young man he answered that black american i can not stand to look him in the eyes for it strikes terror in my soul what are you talking about williams asked he says his name is thomas old man okeke explained i would not expect you youngsters to know this but thomas is the englishmans name for tunde you know what tunde means it means coming back and im sure this is no accident of names i still dont know what youre talking about williams admitted ah old man okeke scoffed you young people only have book sense and no knowledge of your own history youll call it juju but i have a mysterious sense of knowledge it is related to this black americans coming here and it makes me terribly upset many many years ago segun of kabbo was sold into slavery and he promised he would return oh boy williams laughed you old people with your juju your superstition and your mysterious knowledge all thats a bunch of nonsense he declared then he laughed his way on back to the picnic
in the halcyon days of vaudeville dancing especially tapdancing was considered a major form of entertainment to some extent it still is but with the death of blackface coonshouting and cakewalking the hoofing art contracted a sickness which some people believe will eventually lead to its unfortunate demise the graveness of the situation concerning individual dancers of today can best be seen by the lack of star performers on stage screen  and television not since the heyday of bill bojangles robinson has there emerged a dancer who could begin to approach the popularity of that great artist he left  a bountiful legacy to his profession but apparently he left no heirs such performers as sammy davis jr george kirby john bubbles peg leg bates and the nicholas brothers are still kicking up their heels but the truth is not one of them is considered a star dancer davis is alleverything kirby is a mimiccomic bates is considered by many as being over the hill and both john bubbles and the nicholas brothers are struggling along the comeback trail actually bigtime dancing began to get sore feet following world war ii whereas in prior years hollywood was turning out movies starring the likes of marge and gower champion gene kelly fred astaire ginger rogers the nicholas brothers and the four step brothers they now ceased to do so the movie kingdom like stage and television turned to mass choreography and a limited amount of modern dancing however when one recalls old fashioned dancing the renowned bojangles commands more attention than any other dancer in history it is an unchallenged fact that no dancer before or since has possessed a virtuosity comparable to his when bill first started in the business he was part of a team cooper  robinson within a very short time however he ventured out on his own as a song and dance man with a few jokes thrown in for variety it was through a stroke of luck that he stumbled upon his bread and butter forteone day while performing at the palace theatre in new york city bill sauntered down the steps to acknowledge some friends upon returning to the stage he adlibbed a jig up the steps and the maneuver brought down the house from then on stair dancing was in and so was robinson eventually he occupied the position of being the greatest dancer in the world and in short order he was beckoned to hollywood in the early s he appeared in films such as dixiana the little colonel and many others in the s he starred opposite lena horne in stormy weather and few will forget his roles with americas darling of the era shirley temple by sheer artistry he broke through the wall of racial discrimination into the bigtime kings presidents mayors and statesmen applauded him without ever having had a formal dance lesson himself he became the teacher of every dancing great in the u s indeed he was the hero of the humiliated the protector of the poor and the codifier of hoofing his status as an entertainer testified to the stamina and persistence with which he and other members of the negro race reached for stardom through the clouds of jim crow i make music with my feet he once said and the millions who thrilled to his deft dance steps readily agreed  as could be expected there were those who claimed that bojangles was an uncle tom maybe so but there are those who still say the same things about louis armstrong and this is without doubt an absurdity critics are correct when they say that looking for militancy in both men was and is respectively like looking for tigers in africa but not everyone has to be a dr martin_luther_king to be of service to racial justice both men were simply products of their time robinson was a tap dancer and an entertainer satchmo is a trumpet player and an entertainer thats all they ever were and thats all they ever wanted to be it is gratifying to know that they won their war with success irrespective of the weapons with which they chose to fight in armstrongs opinion bojangles was a showman without parallel he even confesses to copying some of his idols style which anyone who has ever seen louis in person knows what bill did and what louis does is not toming but entertainment seventyone years of age at the time of his death in  bojangles spent a large portion of his life attempting to make others happy it is a matter of record that he died broke but it is also a matter of record that he died a legend perhaps there will someday be a successor to his title but not soon times have changed too much for example when robinson was a boy it was quite common for youngsters to dance on street corners and in alleyways but not any more nowadays they stand on street corners and sing rock n roll songs according to one dance expert the metamorphosis began to take place when dancers who for the most part were underpaid and underrated in vaudeville turned to other careers on the stage many of them switched to singing be cause it offered them the chance to reap overnight riches and fame on the strength of a single hit song shortly afterwards records became the rage and hoofers left their specialty in droves by now vaudeville was on its death bed talking movies and radio had not only robbed the circuits of their stars but most of their customers too theatres all across the country began padlocking their doors and this proved calamitious for youthful dance aspirants without the showcases with which to polish and perfect their art they lost interest in dancing as a profession and sought out other fields of occupation however there is still a ray of hope that hoofing can be rescued currently there are thousands of high school and college students across the country who are enrolled in dance courses and there are thousands more being trained in professional dance institutions but almost all of them are involved in modern dance or jazz dancing the forms promoted by martha graham katherine dunham pearl primus and talley beatty to them tapdancing and all its relatives is as archaic as the old twoaday routines at the palace and is therefore a lost art still in a sense they are preserving this art form and who knows their children might some day restore it to its proper place in the culture a wind of change came to dancing when john william sublett  better known as john bubbles of the old buck  bubbles duo hoofed his way into new york rather than reinterpret known dance steps of the day bojangles style he undertook to reexamine basic premises and in the process discovered what later became known as rhythm dancing his architectonic approach to movement received widespread recognition and gained him universal acclaim but not as much as robinson bubbles says a member of the four step brothers was one of the greatest dancers ever to place a shoe in a rosin box there were many things he could do that bojangles couldnt and bill would never accept any of his challenges but as far as im concerned robinson was the epitome of dance his steps were like poetry in motion robinson and bubbles were not the only big negro dancers in vaudeville others included worth  thompson the five hot shots the three joints of rhythm the three lightnin flashes ford marshall and jones and the five cotton club boys they were experts in such styles as the clog cane toe softshoe adagio and neat song and dance during their peak years each group earned from  to  a week per man but then came the bad days and salaries were slashed almost to nothing in some instances stage managers made more than musicians and stage hands took home more money than dancers it was inevitable that something had to give at the present time there are only three dancing groups that are able to draw more than mere breath at the box office they are the three rhythm kings the nicholas brothers and of course the four step brothers but things are so bad only the step brothers work the major supper club route with any degree of regularity they are on the road  weeks out of the year and they command a fourfigure salary somehow they have managed to survive for  years and according to a spokesman they hope to be around that many more but how long will oldfashioned hoofing be around can anything be done to save it from extinction some experts say yes and others say no but all agree that dancing will never enjoy the popularity it once knew because the art like an evicted tenant has lost its house   and homevaudeville
there is a diminishing passing as clouds in the air of things that once were but now are not here for they passed there were adam and eve living in the garden without any evil fear or doubt then a snake came with an apple in its mouth and eden passed when it rained forty days and forty nights without stopping noah thought the water would never stop dropping but the flood passed hitler in munich drunk from many beers swore that nazism would last a thousand years yet it passed there was a time when men stood blinded by a cotton curtain for that curtain blotted out all light they lived and struggled in that dreary darkness and all their lives were long and lonely nights but that time passed the light of freedom now shines through the cotton curtain once men were blind but now they see though their struggle has not yet ended the dreary darkness is no more and their lives are not the long lonely nights they used to be for the nights are now brightened by the flame of desire and the fire of determination to be free and that flame and that fire has once again lit americas torch of liberty and as that torch brightens the night as the darkness recedes well find that not only the suppressed but also the suppressors themselves were blind for no man can lower a curtain around anyone else and remain in the place where darkness falls without being blinded himself there was a time when men rejoiced because they were freed from the chains but their rejoicing did not last very long for they found that after the visible shackles were broken other chains were welded invisible but just as strong and that time passed like the visible shackles of long ago the invisible chains are falling men have felt the weight of those chains and found that weight appalling for chains cannot imprison the hearts and minds of men nor can they bind the desire for freedom and bring it to an end those chains cannot withstand the pressure of men who want to see america become the true home of the brave and land of the free yet as the shackles lose their strength as the links weaken and wane the welders of those shackles will find that they too were bound by the chains for the man who chains another man must remain at hand to see that the shackles are not broken and therefore neither man is free there was a time when a man dreaded the approaching tomorrow as he gazed back on the fears of a fading yesterday he wondered if those fears would diminish in the night or if tomorrow would renew the horror of yesterdays fright that time too has passed today a man does not stand depressed and forlorn as he glances back at yesterday and toward the approaching morn though many fears are still with him as he stands in the twilight hour those fears will give him the desire and strength to fulfill tomorrows vows and those vows will be renewed each day until that coming night when all america will look backward and forward and find no need for fright and as a man goes forth each day to fulfill the vows he has made hell find that those who caused his fears are themselves afraid for the man who causes others fear is himself touched by the blight of fearing that the others will someday rise above their fright there was a time when it appeared that justice could not move forward that she stood blind and bewildered in a strange and foreign land it seemed as though she was bogged down in the mud of segregation and in the muck of mans inhumanity to man that time also passed the mud and muck has finally parted justice has at last taken a pace out of the depth her journey may indeed prove to be a long one but even the longest journey begins with a single step and her journey will lead far beyond the cotton curtain it will erode the invisible chains it will eliminate the fears and end at a place where america can face the world without shame and as justice begins her journey the entire world will see that america is willing to follow her to the place where all men are free now perhaps the picture will change in the minds of men who saw the eagle come forth with chains rather than an olive branch in its claw there were those times but a tide has come and washed them all away and riding high on the crest of that tide is an idea whose time has come the idea is freedom and the time is now america is being given the chance to show that the statue who stands with a torch in her hand has the right to stand near our shore but let not the tide stop with the washing away of old times let it also wash clean the conscience of our country may that cleansing enable each american to see that the good ship united states was built and launched by all our hands may we all look over the helm and across the bow and see that our ship now floats on a current which can lead on to greatness and glory for passage of the civil_rights bill has given america a finer hour on the stage and her citizens now have new roles in another different drama and when god and historians look back in judgment i am certain they will find that the drama ended in brotherhood and not blood
