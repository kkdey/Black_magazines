 it is more than a hunw dred years since abra¦kji « ham lincoln charqed themselves to the unfinished work of the dead at gettysburg even lincoln with his deep sense of mans imperfections could not know that a century later we would still be striving to abolish injustice no task is more deeply rooted in the complexities of american life poverty and tradition fear and ignorance the structure of our society and the workings of our economy all converge on this enormous wrong which has troubled the american conscience from the beginning its just solution is essential not only to give the full blessings of freedom to negroes but to liberate all of us there are those who say it has taken us a century to move this  far it will take another hundred years to finish the job i do not agree great social change tends to come rapidly in periods of intense activity and progress before the impulse slows i believe we are in the midst of such a period of change it is our task to carry forward nothing less than the full assimilation of more than  negroes into american life this is not to be assimilation of bland conformity our object is not to make all people alike it is as it has always been to allow ready access to every blessing of liberty while permitting each to keep his sense of identity with a culture and tradition in this way we enlarge our freedom and enrich our nation we have just passed a milestone in this task the civil_rights bill of  extends the protection of law to many of the demands of justice this bill of course is not the whole answer but i ask each of you to think what an enormous setback failure to pass it would have been now your government must and will move rapidly to carry out that legislation we also intend to give new vigor to our many activities in the field of equal opportunity the congress in the civil_rights act established the principle that race or color can be no criteria for participation in federal programs last week i approved the first set of regulations to implement that principle those regulations are designed to provide just and prompt and reasoned resolution of all disputes our first objective will always be to assure nondiscriminatory operation rather than to put an end to programs which are vital to the welfare of all americans the widespread voluntary support in all parts of the country of the public accommodation title is proof of the educational value of law and the great reservoir of goodwill among americans i believe this section too will find wide acceptance it is simple justice that all should share in programs financed by all and directed by the government of all the people within your government there are many programs dedicated to the goal of equal opportunity they range from the civil_rights division of the justice department the civil_rights commission and the presidents committee on equal opportunity in housing to the community relations service the presidents committee on equal opportunity in employment and the soontobecreated equal employment opportunity commission each of these groups has a distinct and important mission those now in existence have done a difficult task in an impressive way but they all share the same general objective and they must pursue that objective through cooperation among themselves and with private groups with so many groups in a single field there is always the danger of duplication overlap or unnecessary delay therefore i am delighted to announce that i have asked vice presidentelect hubert humphrey and he has agreedto take responsibility for working with all these groups assisting in coordination of their efforts and guiding them toward energetic pursuit of equal opportunity for all these are some of the steps we are taking there will be more for as the problem of civil_rights has grown in urgency it has also grown in complexity we must open the doors of opportunity but we must also equip our people to walk through those doors thus programs to eliminate poverty to improve education and to provide housing by enlarging the opportunities of all americans assure new opportunities for negro americans there are those who predict that the struggle for full equality in america will be marked by violence and hateand it will tear at the fabric of our society for myself i cannot claim to see so clearly into the future but i do not agree i know that radical feelings flow from many deep and resistant sources in our history in the pattern of our lives and in the nature of man but i believe there are other forcesstronger because they are armed with truthwhich will bring us toward our goal in peace they consist in the sense of morality and justice which is written in our laws and more importantly nourished in the hearts of our people these feelings carried forward by men of goodwill in every part of the land will lead this nation toward the great and necessary fulfillment of american freedom in this way our peoples will once again prove equal to the ideals and values on which this nation rests
is man a gorilla with a gun
extrapolation say the dictionaries is the method of finding by calculation based on the known a series other terms whether preceding or following the method is proper to mathematics and works efficiently when dealing with number and quantity when it is transferred to the realm of quality and of organic life more still to that of history and of culture it tends to lose its precisely exact scientific quality and becomes a venture in creativity or at any rate a work of fantasy imagination now takes the place of calculation there can be no doubt that the scientist who seeks to learn the origin of man from a fossilized remnant of a skull that might have belonged to a man or to a baboon must be blessed with a creative imagination as well as with a scientifically exact intelligence i suppose that when robert ardrey a playwright rather than a professional scientist sub titles his book a personal investigation into the animal origins and nature of man he is serving notice that he intends to extrapolate with unrestrained imaginative abandon at any rate this is what he does there is of course a good basis of scientific evidence in african genesis the most recent discoveries of paleontology made in africa especially the most notable those of dr l s b leakey at olduvai in tanganyika give very convincing indications that the origin of man was in africa and not in asia the olduvai gorge is a deep canyon fantastically rich in fossils and in primitive tools which has preserved a seemingly completely and continuous record of the millionyear period in which man appeared and here it must be clearly said that the conclusions of this book differ radically from those of dr leakey who is certainly the most credible authority on the subject leakey says that the tools at olduvai were the work of man in his earliest known form zinjanthropus mr ardreys thesis is that the tools are the work not of man but of an ape indeed of an inferior ape a vegetarian and pacifist ape who was not even to be the ancestor of man the real ancestor of man in ardreys thesis was an ape who made not tools but weaponsand was a killer so while admitting that l s b leakey is a great scientist mr ardrey says that on this point he has gone wrong mislead by sentimentality and romanticism the term romantic fallacy occurs everywhere in the book and is used to discredit any and every theory of man which does not admit that he is a descendant in the direct line from a killer ape and therefore it must be said that the reader who picks up this book looking for precise and coherent information about the important new discoveries in africa is himself the victim of an illusion what information there is concerns mainly the discoveries and hypotheses of certain south africans whom mr ardrey greatly admires and even this information is buried in autobiographical reminiscence picaresque anecdote and pages of philosophical improvisation on the basis of the remote possibility that there were in africa perhaps a million years ago toolandweapon using homiuids or prehuman apes mr ardrey delivers a very aggressive homily in atheistic evolutionism he attacks not only the traditional christian worldview but also much more radically the worldviews of marx freud darwin and practically everyone else you can think of one theory of man after another is tossed out the window with glorious enthusiasm as romantic fallacy and all because some ape seems to have picked up the leg bone of an antelope and used it to crack the skull of one of his fellows this is all we need in order to entirely reconstruct all social philosophy all history all anthropology all psychology all economics for mr ardrey this one monumental act of violence explains everything homo sapiens including modern man is therefore the direct legitimate descendant of a transitional carnivorous erectwalking righthanded and weaponusing anthropoid because this ape was no ordinary mildmannered vegetarian no generalized fruiteating ape but a ruthless killer ape man emerged man is according to ardrey the child not only of the ape but of the weapon it was the weapon that fathered man not only that but mr ardrey even goes so far as to hint that instead of man developing weapons for himself he was in some sense developed by biology to be a user of weapons whether man is in fact a biological invention to suit the purposes of the weapon must be a matter of future debate whatever that debate may be to suppose that instead of weapons being developed for man man was developed for weapons is carrying alienation pretty far but it is quite characteristic of   mr ardreys worldview and of his south african sources the consequence follows immediately man is by his very nature an inventor and user of weapons and a defender of territory the essence of human nature is therefore not so much rationality as triggerhappiness or at least clubhappiness and territoriality even sex is set aside as a secondary relatively meaningless urge compared with mans essential drive to beat up anything and anyone that threatens to invade his territory yes territory is very important here crucially important man is not really interested in woman in love in the warmth of satisfied libido as freud may have thought man is not so deeply engaged in making a living that his very existence is shaped and dominated by the system of production according to marxian dogma man is an ape that goes berserk when he thinks he is running out of lebensraum and i must admit that mr ardreys description of two rival teams of howling monkeys trying to jam each others broadcasts is very suggestive of modern political life the chief contention of robert ardreys highpowered social message is that any philosophy religious or otherwise which takes an optimistic view of man regards him as basically rational and progressive and postulates that he can better himself by using his intelligence to improve his social system is basically a romantic illusion it is absurd says mr ardrey to hope that man can settle his differences over territory by means of arbitration rather than by bombs man is a predator whose natural instinct is to kill with a weapon it is fortunate that some members of the human race are still capable of thinking otherwise for instance pope john xxiii in his encyclical pacem in terris quite apart from religious faith and christian hope it seems to me that mr ardreys thesis negates any real hope there may be for man in evolutionism after all the theory of natural selection postulates that a species is able to survive by progressive adaptation to new and more difficult conditions we armed gorillas have now reached a rather crucial point in our evolutionary development in which killing with a weapon is about the least effective way of settling our problems and guaranteeing our survival it would seem that if we cannot get beyond the stage where we were a million years agoin other words if we cannot adapt to a new situation and settle our problems by reason instead of with clubswe are soon going to be as extinct as any dinosaur the amusing thing about all this is that we are a species that has been given the choice of survival or nonsurvival we have very large skulls and presuming there is still a proportionate content inside them it is up to us to make use of them for something besides inventing ways to blow ourselves up this is so obvious that even mr ardrey after ignoring and scouting it for over three hundred pages finally has to face it in his last chapter cains children with conclusions that we shall presently see the author of african genesis is totally and slavishly committed to a philosophy of ironbound determinism which is dominated by one inexorable obsession the killer ape armed with the legbone of an antelope because man descended in a direct line from an ape with a weapon then he is predetermined to be a killer he is before all else a killer and it is folly to even consider him being anything else at least until his lucky genes have had a few hundred thousand more years mr ardrey confesses himself to be firmly convinced of mans pristine depravity thus he is committed to a worldview in which violence barbarism murder and every form of violence are bound to prevail yet the whole picture is not all of unrelieved darknessotherwise the book would hardly have been a bestseller in america what about freedom man is predetermined to be a killer but fortunately his killing habits are the basis of his freedomfreedom from vegetarianism freedom to leave the jungle and roam around the world living on highcalory foods and having a wonderful time man is a gorilla with a gunand a credit card freedom was the first gift of the predatory way and doubtless as man exists for the weapon so does freedom the progress of the weapon is mankinds most significant cultural endowment however the idea that man is capable of destroying all life with his weapons is dismissed by mr ardrey as neoromantic it presumes too much of mans capacities while a giant effort on the part of man could conceivably bring extinction to all land vertebrates it is impossible to believe that a world of insects would not survive though a nuclear disaster is according to him very likely it cannot be more than a partial disaster as a result of which overpopulation will cease to be a problem in india and instead there will be plague and anarchy a depleted population of radiated mutants may end up being devoured by rats says our author cheerfully but even this evolution will come out on top nevertheless he has another optimistic alternative which is a surprising variant of the new red or dead realism man has indeed reached his peak he has developed the absolute weapon but now he must learn to live without it at this point we begin to wonder if mr ardrey is suddenly going to say something useful what he says is this if man has to live without war he is heading for a deep decline society and culture  will disintegrate without armed conflict to keep them going moral j order sheltered throughout all history by the judgment of arms will collapse but perhaps evolution will finally develop out of our race a new breed that really has and uses reason however mr ardrey would not have us be romantics putting our trust in conscience to preserve sanity and life for conscience is irrational is in league with our illusions entirely subjective and provincial it is consequently amoral it operates with symbols and emotions not with ideas and principles it is animal not rational in fact it is essentially an antirational power it has created a chamber of dull horrors called civilization and neither conscience nor civilization can save us our only hope is the presence of cain our unpredictable ancestor living in our wild genes he will take care of everything whether it be firing the weapon or avoiding a general disaster because he prefers to fight in the back streets with a switchblade knife it is old daddy cain who alone knows the answers and makes the choices we are children of cain and were it not so then for humanity there would be small hope i am prompted to reflect that this is where you end up when you lose your grasp on the real import of the higher religion no man can really exist completely without a religion and a philosophy if he  gets rid of good ones he will unconsciously exchange them for bad ones if he is impatient of myth in higher religion then he will end up fabricating a myth of his own and organizing his own crude fantasies into another homemade system which pleases him better with consequences that are only too well known now mr ardreys exploits in mythmaking are not hard to observe they are evident on every page of his book to take just one example on page  he wants to give a brief description of lake victoria as the spot near which man came into existence there are innumerable ways in which one could describe lake victoria out of a hundred possible qualifiers mr ardrey characteristically selects the following a hundred miles to the east spreads sprawling and enormous the cynically smiling face of lake victoria poisonous with disease crawling with crocodiles the probable focus of our earliest human experience i submit that people who read books like this need a little elementary training in semantics in the interests of their basic mental and spiritual hygiene such a sentence ana there are hundreds like it in the book has one function above all others it attempts to predispose the readers emotions by a suitable feeling of disillusionment an awareness of the general dominion of evil and violence as the basic law of all existence once one feels this one will resist the romantic fallacy and will experience less compunction in reaching for a gun or firing an icbm this kind of thinking is all too common in the twentieth century theories which substituted genes for intelligence and conscience abounded in the europe of mussolini of hitler of goebbels the second world war was not the direct consequence of mental conditioning by pseudoscientific myth the nazi dogma of race blood and land developed an ideology of war and conquest out of just this kind of emotionally loaded anthropology everyone is aware that hitlers racism was in part simply a crudely misunderstood mishmash of popular evolutionism hitlers attempts to help the processes of natural selection with his gas chambers are mentioned in the book with no particular expression of romantic disapproval once when the quiet and distinguished spanish philosopher miguel de uramuno was lecturing at salamanca in the early thirties a falangist general leaped up and expressed his impatience with all forms of humanism by shouting viva la muerte the heroes of african genesis are the killer gorilla and daddy cain the god if we can call it that which has watched over the gorillas fortune and destiny is no other than death mr ardrey is cool toward all other gods particularly to the ones that favor nonviolence and compas sion about death he waxes lyrical death is the evaluator    death choses    death disposes    we should all be lost in a wilderness of chance had not death through a bill on choosings erected the value of the world i know if this last sentence had a meaning and i am not able to find a meaning in it myself it would be that death is a kind of free and personal absolute and mr ardrev w  turns out to be no atheist after all nothing can better dispose us for a third world war than the conviction that we are doomed to fight anyway that our enemies are all wellarmed gorillas too and the only smart thing to do is to let them have it before they ambush us in the chaotic atmosphere of a nation torn by race riots deafened by the stridency of hate groups and of fanatics it is understandable that readers may deride a kind of perverse comfort from this mythology they will do so all the more readily because there is an unquestionably important basis of scientific data mixed in with the theatrical rhetoric and sermonizing of a frican genesis romanticism has more forms than one the sentimentally optimistic kind that served the purpose of nineteenth century laissez faire and the liberal myth of perpetual easy progress has obviously had its day but it has yielded to the tough and callous romanticism of the street gang or of the fascist storm troopa romanticism no less fallacious and deceptive for the fact that it also on occasion covers itself with a veneer of realism and pseudoscience this second kind of fallacy is that which we find developed and indeed monstrously overdeveloped in african genesis it is all the more regrettable because it is rooted in an intuition one which in our day has become completely unavoidableof the desperateness of the human situation this is the greatest and most urgent truth of our time we live in the presence of the meaninglessness and absurdity to which we have been inexorably reduced by our own more or less dishonest attempts to convince ourselves that we were progressing toward a definite and even a noble goal the pessimism of the existentialists may indeed be dour and frustrated but it has at least a certain stoic dignity about it but this fraudulent attempt to organize the negativity and desperation of modern man around a stupidly melodramatic killer image assembled from the less responsible surmises of popular anthropology can do nothing whatever to help modern man in his quest for identity and for meaning it is one thing to admit our violence and face it humbly and realistically quite another to turn that acceptance into the shouting and posturing of racist selfcongratulation
periodically the air staff board a group of  general officers meet in the pentagon to insure that their collective judgment and experience are brought to bear upon important matters concerning the air force among this starstudded group is maj gen benjamin o davis jr air force director of manpower and organization and the only negro general officer in the u s armed forces near minot air force base n d  feet below the surface of the ground a white minuteman missile crew commander places a key around the neck of captain leonard i saunders the ritual denotes that full responsibility for the alert status of the missiles becomes that of the yearold negro these experiences point out the increased responsibility given negroes in the u s air force since it became a separate service in  at that time military units were segregated because the war department felt it segregation has proven satisfactory over a long period of years and to make changes would produce situations destructive to morale and detrimental to the preparation for national defense prominent negroes protested the arrangement during the s some progress had been made however general davis father now retired became the first of his race to be promoted to brigadier general judge william hastie was appointed civilian aide to the secretary of war officer candidate schools were desegregated these advances however had very little effect upon the average negro airman those who couldnt fly or were never given the opportunity to learn aircraft maintenance were restricted to construction and transportation duties or other specialized tasks his skills and even his ability were a matter of debate the largest percentage of negroes about  were stationed at lockbourne field near columbus ohio they operated as a  separatebutequal combat unit on july   the beginning of the end of military segregation came at that time president truman as commanderinchief of the armed forces issued an executive order to promote the highest standards of democracy in the armed forces the legal effect of this was to nullify separatebutequal recruitment training and service the order according to general davis was received with mixed reactions some of the men were reluctant to being uprooted and assigned to different environments however the largest percentage of the men considered the change a challenge and were eager to correct a long injustice he said lt col george j friedline who at the time commanded a segregated unit at andrews field maryland said integration of his unit took place without incident we integrated by moving all the men out of the barracks and reassigned them to quarters by alphabet there wasnt any other fair way of doing it he said in the early s integration became a practical necessity the korean crisis brought an immediate swelling of the armed forces this plus the policy of replacing troops in korea by regular rotation gradually eliminated segregation for the first time the negro was permitted to fight as an integrated member of a unit yet even with this impetus integration took almost six years to accomplish in  the office of the assistant secretary of defense reported that    full integration of negro personnel    contributed to improved utilization of personnel overconcentration of negroes in certain specialties and shortages in others tended to disappear as full advantages were taken of the equal ity of opportunity to attend service schools and to advance on the basis of experience and ability    the change wasnt as smooth as the defense department indicated it had been however it meant that identification of race had to be eliminated from certain service records and assignment orders it meant that a negro first sergeant could order a mississippian to perform kp kitchen police duty or other unpleasant duties if need be above all it meant restraint on the part of the colored airman who was assigned to a unit and found that the top bunk near the latrine was left vacant for him or that after attending preparatory school for personnel duties he was assigned to a base as disposal officer because he just wouldnt fit in with the rest of the staff for all the challenge was great but the negro airman made progress senior master sergeant grant s williams sr a sergeant major at selfridge air force base mich said attitude played an important part in the change i never carried a chip on my shoulder said sergeant williams i maintained restraint and later won the cooperation of suspicious whites who had never worked for or with a negro general davis recalls that unlike lieutenant frederick d gregory a recent graduate of the air force academy he lived alone during his fouryear attendance at west point from  the  other students all white lived in twoman rooms yet he was the first of his race to graduate from the school in  years gregory was one of several negroes to earn a commission from the academy in its brief nineyear history after integration the general went on to command units in korea and formosa and to hold management positions with the far east air forces and u s air forces in europe today as the air forces director of manpower and organization he is responsible for all matters pertaining to manpower organization and management engineering a position comparable to a corporate vice president he directs a pentagon staff of  military and civilian personnel they must justify to the department of defense bureau of budget and the congress the six billion dollar manpower requirement of the air force the general describes his job as important interesting and unglamourous one order for a reduction in personnel and i become the most unpopular man in the world he said awesome could well describe captain saunders assignment as a missile combat crew commander for around his neck in a minuteman missile silo near minot air force base hangs one of the keys that would destroy enemy targets in the event of a nuclear attack on this nation the captain is one of a handful of highly trained and skilled negroes working in one of the most selective jobs in the air force surrounded by a maze of colored lights cables and switches saunders indicated an awareness of his responsibilities by explaining that the missiles can be launched only on orders from the president of the united states by turning two keys once the order has been authenticated i cant launch without my deputy meaning capt ross w randolph also colored these keys he said pointing to the objects hanging from their necks must be turned simultaneously by both of us neither man accepted the quip that they may well be the first to send minuteman missiles soaring toward their targets if a nuclear war should break out it is highly unlikely that such responsibility would have been bestowed upon saunders and randolph prior to  true negroes dropped bombs on enemy targets and strafed enemy territory during world war ii and were recommended for more than  distinguished flying crosses but to have the authority to unleash tons of tnt takes stability and maturity these ingredients it was then believed were rare in the negro today the negro airman has been conceded the right to be qualified for a delicate assignment and be depended upon to carry it out note these examples during the cuban crisis capt thomas l hennagan flew reconnaissance missions over cuba in the mileanhour rf jet aircraft for exemplary courage and professional competence    under hazardous flight conditions he was awarded the distinguished flying cross the nations second highest decoration for combat capt joseph s grant jr was one of the first negroes to be selected to train vietnamese air force pilots in combat support activities a test pilot capt edward j dwight is currently serving as an experimental flight test officer at wrightpatterson afb ohio he performs flight test evaluation on new improvements in design and instrumentation of bomber aircraft applicable to both military and civilian aircraft while men like grant dwight and hernagan are making history others of their race are making unheralded progress at changing the air force image of the negro at the grass roots level at an air base in georgia lieutenant walter a collins and technical sergeant bennie sparks supervise integrated staffs of military and civilians capt annie l lawrence is a personable general duty nurse at andrews afb md she cares for some  patients including wives and dependents of military personnel and diplomats at mather afb  calif maj haldane king a member of the first class of negro bomber pilots accounts for and budgets millions of dollars necessary for the operation of the base col william a campbell now branch chief aerospace forces division at air force headquarters has served in a quasidiplomatic post in turkey he was an advisor with the joint u s military assistance training team in ankara these men and women and thousands like them justified president trumans annulment of the separatebutequal policy which applied until  the military once said that it was not a sociological laboratory true it was not and should not be but it has done much to provide a means of communication and education between the races when a negro officer or sergeant tells a middleaged white southerner assigned to his office to perform a task and it is accomplished in an attitude of cooperation this is a significant social achievement more often than not the mere performance of an assigned responsibility can at least temporarily lower racial barriers in some communities as in the case of capt keaver holley iii in brownfield texas holley braving intense heat and high winds for over half an hour piloted a helicopter which rescued an injured worker from a foot grain elevator shaft to show their appreciation for his heroism the city held a dinner in his honor holley and his wife set a precedent by being seated at the head table with civic leaders at the affair in a community which practiced strict segregation and so it has been with the negro airman so dedicated to democracy so deeply committed to justice and freedom he has had conflicts and through it all maintained restraint there have been significant breakthroughs and the negro has achieved the beginnings of equality in the air force
while freedomseeking organizations struggle for civil_rights in labor education public accommodations voting numerous other areas while the press radio and television give dazzling coverage of throngs of negroes and whites demonstrating for the cause of human dignity one might easily deduce that the negro population because the goals sought are primarily for its benefit is completely activated this is not true to be sure one of the most lamentable facts to be dealt with in the movement for civil_rights is that of apathy in large sectors of the negro population the slothful attitude of persons who seem contented with things just as they are and who are unwilling to join the fight for rights is of no small frustration to negro leaders who spearhead rights movements three areas where this dispiriting situation exists are considered here first the negro elite it is in this segment of successful professional and business men and women that one would normally expect solidarity in the push not only for unlimited horizons in their own fields but also for broader opportunities and full assimilation of the less fortunate of their race i say this because the relative secureness of this group which not incidentally has been largely gained through negro patronage makes less likely their suffering from reprisals from the adversary moreover it is from this group that leadership should logically spring it doesbut in fartoomany cases negroes of the upper bracket are selfishly content to enjoy the fruits of their own success caring little or nothing about the social revolution now in progress which seeks to deliver all peoples of this land to the doors of freedom and dignity there too are some such as one of the wealthiest negro businessmen and manufacturers who refused to endorse the battle for civil_rights legislation scorning the efforts to remove racial barriers he declared that the negro automatically created the barrier himself by the lack of positive action in his own behalf that the lack of initiative courage integrity loyalty and wisdom are responsible for his not making the rate of progress that he should make secondly and probably to negro leadership the most discouraging of all groups comes the complacent element that has succumbed to tokenism these negroes gullibly note scattered privileges at places of public accommodation and the scant hiring of negroes on white collar jobs and placidly resign themselves in blind faith to an unquestioned dream about things that will naturally get betterbecause they are better now than they were fifty years ago but more than  years ago w e burghardt du bois author of the souls of black folk pointed to certain human essentials which were sorely needed in that day many of which remain unattained at this time work culture libertyall these we need not singly but together not successively but together each growing and aiding each he wrote and all striving toward that vaster ideal that swims before the negro people the ideal of human brotherhood gained through the unifying ideal of race such ideal is not attainable by inaction and credulity but is best achieved through positive efforts through politics moral appeals law suits public protests etc nevertheless some kind of effort must be spentin concert probably nowhere are greater efforts needed than in the third group consideredthat multitude of non and semiliterates whose lives liberty and pursuits of happiness are but unpitied abortions struck by the knife of the southern way of life blinded by ignorance circumscribed by fear degraded by the standard setters these are people who have little faith in the possibility that they too may someday be free to contribute to and share in the fulfillment of the american dream but fulfillment of this dream for the negro first requires a vigorous demolition of all apathetic obstructions that darken his vision and thwart the equality process he must take unrelenting action to remedy all the frustrating conditions mentioned afore what can be done well obviously a distinct approach must be made to each area to successful negro professionals business men and women doctors merchants lawyers manufacturers dealers in services etc who scorn positive efforts to gain in all fields full equality for the negro who fail to align themselves with the swelling freedom movement who about the race problem openly express an attitude of unconcern i would apply the same kind of technique that is now effectively used to sway obdurate white merchantsboycott there simply is no reason why these negro magnates who have made fortunes in the markets of  their own race should be spared the ax of selective patronage as concerns the group that has been mesmerized by tokenism those who cannot see the hollowness of their plight because of a few dazzling democracylabeled trinkets dangling before their eyes the leadership has a kingsize task cut out for itself it must find ways of communicating to these people the truth that there are many other rights more meaningful and longoverdue where the scant tokens came fromright underneath the trampling feet of the racists to fail to demand these rights while credulously applauding the measly crumbs that have been grudgingly doled out by the moderates is to guarantee that there is where they will remain to prepare the selfsatisfied to realize this truth perhaps it is necessary to in every possible way dispossess them of their illusions take them a step backwards and snatch from them their pacifying baubles of freedom and opportunity they must not be allowed to go about unpressured stubbornly insisting that everything is all right the freedomconscious should flatly reject the apathetic demonstrators should vigorously demonstrate against them the negro press should ceaselessly condemn them the rights of the unconcerned to partake of token freedomgimmicks must be challenged at every point the complacent negro must be awakenedin a way not wholly unlike that of the proverbial farmer who sometimes had to slam a twobyfour between the eyes of his mule simply to get his attention but there are some this third group who find nothing meaningful upon which their attention can focus mainly because it is obstructed by the veils of ignorance and despair not largely selfimposed these factors of misdirection have shunted their victims far adrift of the mainstream of american democracy one vivid example of what must beand what isbeing done to lift veils from these nonparticipating citizens is the voterregistration training program in the deep south pursuing a doortodoor campaign to enlist votingage persons in classes where they can be taught to overcome some of the roadblocks set up by intimidating arbitrary registrars the young people of sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee courageously attack the mammoth problem of getting negro americans in position to exercise their most fundamental right as citizens more grass roots programs for adults must be undertaken by the leadership negro coops banks and insurance companies while upon first mention might appear to be institutions which concede and give support to a segregated system are vitally necessary to cushion the misfortunes of awakened negroes who struggling to make the transition from peonage and indignity to freedom and equality become victims of violent and revengeful racists who ruthlessly evict them from property and dispossess them of goods a notable point here however is that when the veil is lifted the negro then evicts hitnselj from his house of despair dispossesses himself of his attitude of apathy generally apathetic attitudes of the negro come about as a result of longstanding restrictive conditions that have been imposed upon him he has in the past been limited to small benefits lying within a defined sphere he has from past experience found it futile to expect any other good that lies outside this boundary thus this mental attitude has become hardened and resists change even when the restrictions which have heretofore limited his progress have been removed if this attitude is to be removed it must immediately be replaced by anotherone of hopefulness the method by which the supplantation must be made is precisely the problem of negro leadership
a sultry summer day 
two gate posts of crumy  i y bling brick stand at the  city limits of holly springs mississippi as you enter to your left is rust college a humble methodl   ist college very much involved in the black revolution across the street is mississippi industrial statefunded and therefore uninvolved turn left at the first block and you are on rust avenue the first building you come to an old frame bungalow is the cofo council of federated organizations center next to it is the holly springs freedom school  my fellow traveler edward sheehan author of kingdom of illusion and i had traveled a long way to see ivanhoe donaldson on a night in chicago a few months earlier we had listened to this young new yorker describe the mississippi summer project ivanhoe had been a junior at michigan state university when four years before he had joined sncc now he was the director of a fivecounty program of voter registration campaign and freedom schools all centered here in holly springs we stopped the car in front of  rust avenue the stifling mississippi heat and the fact that we had been tailed for miles by the police in the last town led me to shed my clerical collar and coat the collar not only made me hot but apparently aroused the suspicions of the mississippi officers feeling a sense of relief at having reached our destination safely i was surprised to be greeted by a young angry negro squat and husky dressed outlandishly in coveralls and a huge farmers straw hat he asked crisply who are you smiling as friendly as i could manage i replied that i was a chicago priest friend of ivanhoe donaldson but for this fellow this was no password lets see some id he demanded i proceeded to show him my drivers license my collar voters card etc and said brother youre worse than some mississippi police to him my joking remark was not funny listen he retorted a mans life might depend on this resentfully but convinced he thrust out his hand and said im hardy frye we shook hands he walked off and we headed into the headquarters the next person to greet us was indeed happy to see us kathy dahl is my name are you the catholic priest from chicago she asked ivanhoe donaldson had mentioned i was coming and kathy was a catholic nurse originally from the midwest she was working to become registered in mississippi so that she might stay on in the project after the summer was over kathy was very happy to meet a priest of her faith interested at all in a cause for which she was daily risking her life ironically kathy had come to the project through the protestant council of churches a tall negro teenager from the town who was present at the headquarters offered to direct me to the church so that i might arrange to say mass on the next day sunday if the priest wanted me we went first to the spanking new catholic church and school standing out almost grotesquely amid the frame buildings in the colored section of town the same priest was pastor of both the colored and white church and wasnt enthusiastic at all about the mississippi project but told me i could say the  oclock mass the next morning his attitude regarding the unkemptness of the workers and especially of communist influence among them was a common one i had during the week the criticisms seemed to me to be largely irrelevant and out of touch with one of the real authentic social revolutions taking place in our times at most one of the hundred workers i met larry rubin had an uncle who was a red we went back to the center and ivanhoe still had not returned rev e g freud presbyterian chaplain to the group was glad to see us and exchanged some pleasant conversation about dear old pope john and the new spirit he engendered then we sat out on the front steps talking again to kathy dahl talking about many things but always coming back to the noninvolvement of our church suddenly a pickup truck pulled up in front of the house a young fellow hurried toward us addressed himself to kathy and asked do you know wayne yancey yes she replied but hes in memphis no hes dead he died out on the road six miles out from here they ran headon into another car the other fellows on his way to the hospital abruptly he turned went back to his truck and kathy shuddered  silently she turned to me and advised me to say nothing to the others who hadnt paid any attention to the young mans coming she whispered to one young white fellow asked him to come with us and asked me to drive her and him to the hospital as i pulled the car out i remembered the wailing sirens of a quarter of an hour before at that moment kathys premonition and her experience in the project had led her to remark that she prayed that none of the workers were involved in what must be an accident on the road indeed some were involved and one was dead what i saw in that next hour will remain indelibly fixed in my memory hurriedly i put on my collar and suitcoat pulled out our rented car and hurriedly drove the mileandahalf that brought us to the greenwood hospital kathy was as i mentioned a registered nurse and was anxious to see what help she might be indeed during the next hourandahalf she was the only person with any professional medical knowledge who treated charley scales a young man in terrific pain with a smashed hip broken jaw and many lacerations the doctor of the hospital was reportedly over on the other side of the institution treating a seriously sick white man i had rushed into the hospital with kathy and was given free entry now perhaps due to my clerical garb after kathy began to give whatever ministrations she could to the injured man i decided to go back out the door and to see if what i had glimpsed as we hurried in could possibly be true indeed it had been true there across the street in a blue combination ambulancehearse lay the body of a human being horribly from the rear window a foot stuck out there like the carcass of an animal lay the strong broken dead black body of wayne yancey mr brittenum the negro mortician of holly springs stood beside the vehicle which he owned and at the direction of a policeman threw back the canvas cloth revealing the smashed face of a young man a young student from hawaii positively identified the remains as those of wayne yancey we walked back to the hospital steps in a few moments ivanhoe donaldson made his first appearance on the scene he came hurrying across the front lawn of the hospital then crossed the street heading with two companions toward the ambulance he waved a hasty greeting to me at his side was the young man who had been our greeter hardy frye his face impassive dressed in blue jeans and a tshirt his feet in sandals the frail figure of ivanhoe donaldson belied his importance this young man is a key figure in the movement which had finally begun to shake the whole nation and which a few weeks hence would be thrust before the conscience of the nation at the democratic convention observing from the sidewalk a softbellied white man his thin blond hair sleeked back barked an order to the policeman he was mayor cooperwood dont let nobody touch the body mayor cooperwood shouted hardy frye let out a cry of rage turned and ran past the policeman and gathering crowd toward the rear steps of the hospital i thought surely that one of the gathering group of policemen would seize him hardys rage at the death of his companion was compounded by a fear that a list of the names and addresses of negro farmers friendly to the movement might be in waynes pocket and thereby likely to fall into the hands of the police a sickening resentment that was new to me though not to those experienced in mississippis way began to seize me no doctor at all had even taken the time to see if perhaps one ounce of life might be left in wayne yancey in fact no doctor ever had or ever would come out to certify him as dead mayor cooperwood walked to his car and we could all hear him summoning the rest of his police force in a few minutes more policemen were on the scene including the fish and game warden in his truck when they appeared the mayor ordered the negro undertaker to get out of there with the body the only official recognition of waynes death was the police charging charley scales the driver of the car who at that moment lay in the hospital attended only by kathy dahl with manslaughter a charge which carried a maximum sentence of twenty years a civil_rights worker would certainly get the maximum ivanhoe asked me to hurry back to the headquarters and pick up one of the young lawyers who were part of the project something had to be done to see if it would be possible to make the tragedy just the death of wayne and not the slow death of the other young man in a mississippi jail as i hurried back and forth to the hospital i realized that the fatal accident in any estimation had little to do with the whole movement the car of the rights workers had been passing on one of the many hills on the road between memphis and holly springs and collided headon with a car driven by another young negro who was also hurt but not so seriously but then i thought of the constant tensions these people lived under for just one week now i had been in mississippi everytime i gripped the wheel of the car i was tense that very afternoon a police car had tailed us bumper to bumper through oxford mississippi trailed us a mile or so out of town your tension and fear as you go  milesanhour dreading any minute to be stopped for speeding or for obstructing traffic for some obscure license violation for any of dozens of charges has a maddening effect on your nerves only god  knows what effect it had had on this tragic afternoon at any rate wayne yancey was dead charley scales was placed under arrest and ivanhoe was told that he would have to get an ambulance to take charley to the john gaston hospital in memphis tennessee brittenums ambulance was summoned again he had to be paid and ivanhoe and kathy made the trip to memphis to get medical care for charley and to see the lawyers headquartered in a memphis hotel to find if there might be a way to keep charley from the terrifying charade of mississippi justice the evening came on quickly and quietly i promised that the next mornings mass would be offered for wayne and arrangements were made by rev freud and a young negro minister to conduct evening services on sunday for him on the campus of rust college a scheduled dance for the youngsters of town was held at the college that night sheehan and i went over and mingled with the young people and the professors many of them yaleys taking their summer vacation from yale by teaching at rust i met several young people from the catholic high school and enjoyed the evenings music played by three local students hardy frye sat around with us at the dance somehow our few hours of involvement at holly springs had won hardy over to us  he was a californian finishing college at berkeley his coveralls and farmers hat were the habit of the movement brash tough willing to die hardy wears the coveralls in somewhat the same manner that francis wore brown in assissi long ago they call me mr freedom it makes me angry to realize that we need the white workers to protect us but we do if those first three martyrs this summer werent two of em white nobody would have cared but the fbi is around now if they kill me the country will hear about it and the white sheriff hes beginning to be fair he sees me on the freedom days marching   people to the courthouse to register he knows that  per cent or more of the people here are negro and he likes his airconditioned office and fancy cigars hes getting to think that maybe its time to start being a little fairer his deputy is still a sadist though every morning this summer ive headed downtown my job is voter registration in town the first thing i do is go to the country courthouse in the town square and fall asleep the policeman comes along and nudges me and says move on boy i talk back and say man ill move on when you move all those rednecks off the steps too and he lets me be it does the young colored kids a lot of good to see a black man talk back and like i say if they kill me theyll hear about it hardy had been arrested since the afternoon at the hospital they arrested his companion cleve for resisting arrest by not replying sir to a policeman hardy was picked up because they claimed the tennessee license on the rented car in which he sat was invalid hardy chose to go right to trial on the spot and they took him to the judge who ran a grocery store in town the fine was  hardys last dollar for the moment but he paid it rather than spend the weekend in jail when he might be needed laughingly he said what are you going to do father in a place where the judge who finds you guilty and fines you cant even spell california in writing out my address some of hardys talk seemed at variance with a totally nonviolent approach but it seems to me that a totally nonviolent approach is now humanly impossible the philosophy of dr martin_luther_king jr seemed based upon the fact that redemptive suffering and nonviolence would change the hearts of the dominant white society this has not happened at least not with requisite speed robert moses leader of the mississippi project has evolved a new approach that combines nonviolence with a realization that violent reactions might come in reply and the hope must be that the violent reactions will bring a response from the power structure of the south not of love but of law enforcement to prevent further anarchy the leaders say that the last thing they want is federal occupation of mississippi federal occupation always means the preservation of the status quo federal intervention is absolutely necessary to get voters registered but the real solution lies in men like the sheriff beginning to realize that the status quo is being changed gradually but really in ten years the negro will have a real substantial voice in the destiny of his state that at least is the hope i offered mass the next morning for wayne yancey my last mississippi meal was breakfast in the backroom of a negro tavern canteloupe and coffee with kathy sheehan and frye sunday was a day to eat in the back room because the police turned out in full force on sunday mornings to stop any attempts of the freedom workers to integrate sunday worship services in the churches of holly springs finally after breakfast ed sheehan and i got to visit with a very weary ivanhoe donaldson ivanhoe wished that we could have been around longer to see what was being done so successfully in the rural areas at least as we sat talking in the center we saw the fruits of months of work for dozens of people men and women dressed in their sunday best began to arrive from holly springs and from the nearby farms they were going to leave together in a sixcar caravan and head for the district convention in greenville mississippi that afternoon it seems unjust to call the freedom democratic party a mock party or a symbolic protest as senator humphrey compromisingly described it in atlantic city the freedom democratic party is a political party real people from hattiesburg and jackson and greenville and greenwood from city shacks and barren farms people coming alive at frightful personal risk coming alive to a sense of their own dignity and power ivanhoe told us that after this days meeting in greenville the state convention in jackson would come on thursday and then on to atlantic city television recorded for millions the reality of the freedom democratic party and brought to the fore the brave clarksdale druggist dr aaron henry who summarized amidst the swirling confusion of the convention the reality of the work of young negroes like ivanhoe donaldson and the hundreds who joined them in mississippi and remain there now the freedom democratic party did not and could not compromise the whole essence of the lives of those involved is an uncompromising commitment to really change things in mississippi and the nation the compromises of credentials committees and politicians anxious to hold on to votes do not make sense to people who daily risk their lives and jobs and families the cries of senator eastland of communism the complaints about the way that the young people dress seemed so ludicrous to us at the climax of our trip and i hope to the whole nation who viewed the atlantic city convention it would be good if everyone of us who seeks false compromises could spend time in mississippi we all need to look often at the quiet dignity of ivanhoe and kathy and hardy we cannot turn away when it is time to contemplate the neglected smashed remains of wayne yancey who made the long trip back to the south from his home on jackson boulevard in chicago in order to really do something about freedom the regular mississippi democrats walked out of the national convention and after much ado the sergeantsatarms managed to keep the seats empty but we cannot go on pretending that mississippi is empty or isnt there those crumbling gate posts at the entrance of holly springs open to an integral part of america until we realize that with all that it takes in the personal committment of our lives in our own homes then our efforts in viet nam or anywhere else ring false wayne yancey is dead so are the three chaney schwerner and goodman but hardy frye and hundreds like him are alive mayor cooperwood and his like are also alive the outcome of the battle is far from certain the cost in lives is impossible to tell as you pass those crumbling gate posts the brown scenery of dead grass on the campus of rust college is noticeably devoid of any signs of new construction but as i pulled out of that town after a quick week of visiting the freedom centers i was convinced that a new holly springs a whole new mississippi and america is being built not by architects and laborers with bricks but by the dedicated young men and women of the mississippi project
return of a native daughter
with the inflection of surprise the young turkish woman had said well you are the very first american i have ever met who was not looking forward to going home then came her candid second thought but you are the first american black i have known i considered my bleak past as a negro in america and the uncertain future for me and my generation of american blacks of course i assured her my color has a great deal to do with my reluctance my dread of returning to the united states  did not speak of returning as going home the country had never provided me with the safety the comfort the freedom that the word home implies there was something else i felt compelled to say if i were white with similar values and aspirations i daresay i still would be reluctant to return there are some things about america which render much of the country virtually unlivable for certain types or groups of peopleirrespective of race the pockets of american expatriates all over the world are evidence of that evidence of the search for a kind of freedom that is not available to substantial minorities of people in the united states this indictment astonished my listener whose interactions with americans had occurred most frequently across her desk at the us information service in istanbul i hastened to elaborate on the charge what i mean is there are strict limits on a most personal kind of freedomthe freedom to be ones self it is very keenly felt if the self you happen to be does not fit the general pattern that is summarized succinctly in the cliches allround and allamerilean this of course needed clarification i went on to describe the risks one takes in america when it is apparent that he holds an unorthodox political view or prefers to wear a beard or favors chess over baseball or elects to spend an evening in a library rather than at a party a pattern of such preferences excludes a person from conventional social contacts in america his interest and preferences are dismissed as idiosyncracies quirks or eccentricities and he is dismissed as a candidate for conventional community life there was not time then to continue my discourse on america and my paranoid streak reminded me that the usis building was not the place for such revelations rather abruptly i ended my conversation with the lady who was beginning to look skeptical but a monologue with the same theme began within me i continued thinking of the individual who is rejected because he is unconventional in american terms and how much more complex his situation is when he happens also to have the conspicuous distinction of being black his position is much more insecure his dilemma much more dangerous his condition much more tragic when an american negro discovers that he can resolve his dilemma and change his condition simply by living in another country how must he feel when he discovers also that he must return to america to live again it is like stepping naked and refreshed from a pool of sweet waters and then again putting on mudcaked ragged clothes that reek with a terrible stench such was my feeling when faced with the knowledge that some irresistible motives were forcing me back to the united states in previous generations a few american negroes known and unknown left the legendary land of the free for a european freedom left and never returned in my own generation unnumbered american negro emigrants are finding permanent niches for themselves in tokyo stockholm lagos and other places where they can move freely be themselves and at long last    live for others of us however permanent exile and expatriation are themes of frequent fantasies but never will become realities i never have experienced the conviction one must feel when he knowingly buys his last oneway ticket from the united states twice i initiated plans for remaining abroad and twice the plans were abandoned why i recalled my first time abroad i was  years old when i went  when i returned to the united statesold enough yet too naive to have anticipated the potential impact of the european experience i hardly was prepared for the transition from restricted life in segregated washington dc to the permissive atmosphere of paris  indeed i was at first bewildered by the strange unnamed sensation i experienced when i looked for a hotel bought a theater ticket or selected a restaurant for lunch or dinner later i realized that that strange unnamed sensation was the feeling of freedom sheer freedom of movement a sensation i have yet to feel in the united states that sensation accompa nied me through the streets i was aware of a difference in other peoples reactions to me and my reactions to them en passant i felt we viewed each other with curiosity or interest or indifference never with the apprehension or anxiety or disdain that i have perceived in the black and white exchange of glances on the sidewalks of america in paris during the course of development of relationships i observed that a difference in skin color was an irrelevant difference the parisians i encountered seemed to possess a kind of social intelligence which penetrates superficial aspects of an individual such as the color of his skin shape of his nose his hair texturean intelligence which searches beneath for signs of beliefs and personal identity although racial characteristics did not seem relevant in their assessments of people parisians in particular and europeans in general are wellinformed about racial conflicts in various parts of the world and especially in the united states only a few have a clear idea of what the daytoday existence of a negro in america must be like many however realize that it must be a miserable existence often i recall the compassion of their invitations to living you ought not suffer the injustices and indignities of your like in america why go back to be mistreated stay here and make paris your home in other placesstockholm geneva rome belgrade istanbul beirutthe same invitation has been extended for the same reasons it is an invitation that i have been unable to accept why the answer and insight were to be found in some lines by james baldwin it is the day he the american living in europe realizes that there are no untroubled countries in this fearfully troubled world that if he has been preparing himself for anything in europe he has been preparing himselffor america preparation for what kind of life in what kind of america am i now prepared to do battle continually on an american front or shall i avoid and evade the conflict in an insulated suburban retreat and where is the retreat that is not in touch by radio television and the press however incomplete the news with the many scattered battle grounds isnt the battle after all mine indeed it is more mine now since i have known the feeling of freedomand the feeling was good the european preparation was essential it was preparation for the role of combatantdefender a role one must be able to play until the final curtain the role carries with it a responsibility for helping to establish a firm basis for a secure freedom in america for myself and my people to leave america permanently would mean abdication of that responsibility for the sake of my people i returned indeed for the sake of all america i returned this has a righteous and an embarrassingly patriotic ring i know but rightly or wrongly it rings true is it not for the sake of america that this war against ignorance and intolerance is being waged it is an extremely patriotic act on the part of the citizens black and white who care enough for the present and the future of the united states to sacrifice personal desires and material gains to risk limb and sometimes life in this fight for freedom the success or the failure of their efforts is crucial to the survival of america america speaks to the free world as its leader what an hypocrisy what a great hoax and who in the world does not know it if america is to make credible her championing a free society obviously freedom must be extended to all the american people moreover the concept of freedom must be clarified for the multitude that does not understand it i am convinced that most americans regardless of race never have experienced the feeling of freedom they do not know what it means to be denied freedom since they never have known what it means to be free the negro in the united states is continually aware that he is not free the white american is reminded of the boundaries and restrictions in the society each time he confronts a negro facetoface or a reference to a negro in the past five years there have occurred a series of very poignant and desperate expressions of the need for freedom in the united states in many places and at many levels it has been demonstrated clearly that the winds of freedom will not blow over the land for a spell last year saw some changes in practices and the lovering of some barriers in hitherto impregnable quarters of the south but it saw also the unflagging strength of the resistance in other southern quarters and the extent of the duplicity and deceit in the rest of the country although there were several positive events negative ones seemed more salient conservatives and segregationists were demoralized and disappointed as were liberals and integrationists white integrationists ran scared while black nationalists grew more hostile it was last year that the names chaney goodman and schwerner were etched painfully in the hideous history of mississippi and just the year before the assassinations of evers then kennedy had revealed the horror that lies deep in the land that same year the year of the centennial celebration of the civil war saw the populace yet immersed in but another stage of that same war it was in  that i returnedin time to watch the final preparations for our great march a march that lay bare the breadth of the unrest and the depth of the hope throughout america the march brought out people brown yellow black and white  from every region of the united states people went to washington because they wanted to express their support of the current movement more important though they went because they were and are extremely concerned about their own personal freedom and wished to demonstrate their concern this seems especially true for the nonnegroes who participated theirs especially was a proclamation of the desire to be able to be ones self an often frustrated desire that troubles a significant minority of people in this strange land the march too was a disclosure of the confidence in the american system that is held by that black and white minority so often frustrated and betrayed by the american system itself it is this very system and its values which must be modified by the current movement specifically pressures toward uniformity which pervade american society are not compatible with the kind of permissiveness and tolerance which must exist in a free society by virtue of a bizarre contradiction in the culture the process of integration is a response to some pressures toward a uniform society although the likelihood of such an amalgamation is remote it may well be a threat to the remnants of negro culture that generations from now negroes may have to struggle to retain for now though the march must be toward the moment of freedom and the social implications of freedom in a new american way of life it must be recognized however that such freedom will not be achieved in america in our time from the shores of europe my eyes have the grotesque confusion the grim paradox of the real america and the ideal america from that distance the real america seemed a monstrous thing from my peculiar vantage point of extreme marginality in america black and illequipped for conventional living the confusion and the paradoxes are more vivid the image more monstrous it is very tempting to turn away from it all on those dismal days when the newscasters report all defeats and no victories i sometimes ask why should i or anybody else give a damn about this country once more i am beset by fantasies of settling down in a foreign haven where i might enjoy freedom and sanctuary then i return to reality i might find freedom there but there is no true sanctuary no hiding place i think of my unborn children and of their unborn again i know why i am here i renew my pledge to myself my pledge to the future of a free america however remote however elusive that freedom this generation has its responsibility for contributing to it i returned knowing that i wanted this period in american history to be a part of my personal history yet i know too how very distant the realization of american freedom is
a fineprint item that appeared near the end of californias long november ballot may prove to be the superweapon segregationists across the country have been looking for it shows a way to wipe out all laws designed to open the housing market to negroesall the antidiscrimination legislation liberals have pushed into enactment in eleven states and nine cities over the past decade that small itema constitutional amendment which california voters approved two to one placed in the state constitution a clause which forbids either the state or any municipality to deny limit or abridge directly or indirectly the right of any person to decline to sell lease or rent any part or all of his real property to any person or persons as he in his absolute discretion chooses in one swipe it nullifies the states two fair housing laws which inhibit discrimination against renters and home buyers and bars any such laws in the future racial discrimination has been indubitably legalized the california brainchild answers the prayers of racists who complain indignantly that no sooner do they beat down one scheme to let negroes in than another rears its head here finally is machinery with the breadth and strength to do the job they want done the solidity of the constitutional amendment makes the referendum seem as ephemeral as a butterfly illinois segregationists already are gathering signatures proposing a constitutional amendment cut after the ingenious california model while in a number of other states basic groundwork is quietly being laid but the product itself is not all that dazzles the technique of marketing it to california voters was equally brilliant the most racist measure ever placed on an american ballot from first to last was characterized as having nothing whatever to do with race its sponsors the state realty and apartment house associations professed to abhor discrimination and to favor integration the issue they insisted was rights the two fair housing laws violated our inherent property rightsthe right to do what one chooses with ones own these mild laws both of them weak in enforcement provisions and administrative machinery were said to constitute forced housing it was claimed they gave government control over the traditionally free housing market and were the opening wedge for government to seize full control over private property in the future and our lives along with it in short the gimmick was confusion the whole area of rights of course is fantastically easy to confuse psychology experiments have proven the strong propensity of humans to respond negatively to anything that suggests a restriction of our rights in a gallup poll that included the south  per cent of those interviewed said they would not move if negroes moved next door but in another poll which excluded the south when the question was framed the other way and persons were asked if they thought they should have the right to refuse to sell to negroes  per cent said they should berkeley realtor jay force one of the architects of the campaign quite knew what he was saying much as he sounds like he doesnt when he declared were simply asking for the people of our great state to have the right to vote on legislation affecting their constitutional rights  to decide for themselves whether or not they want legislation denying limiting or abridging their property rights in the th century ordinarily rational people were similarly confused by the argument that to restrict child labor would be to infringe on our right to hire without interference and that to abolish slavery would be to violate personal property rights campaign strategists foreseeing that there would be insufficient overt racists to carry the measure welded a coalitiona coalition which was characterized by congressman philip burton as the confused and the contemptible  californias achievement should not have surprised anyone no state has demonstrated more racial savvy than california which has been the prime provider of our national segregation techniquesnot the south as some suppose southern negroes were still docile plantation slaves when california began fencing in its orientals san franciscos packed swarming chinatown wasnt designed to amuse tourists with techniques sharpened on yellow skin california during the past decade has quietly received and insulated a half million negro newcomers tucking them away so neatly few californians ever see them los angeles one of the most segregated cities in america thus partitions more than  negro arrivals each month negro californians who number almost an even million comprise the most phenomenal component of the phenomenal growth rate of the nations largest state in election postmortems journalists observed that california had become the first state to write racism into its constitution they were  years late with that credit line california won that laurel in  when the state constitution acquired an amendment granting all necessary power  to cities and towns    for the removal of chinese without the limits of such cities or towns or for their location within proscribed portions of municipalities citizens had been so removing and locating chinese since the latter began arriving in  precivil war days but the chinese had begun wondering out loud if it were legal the golden state retained this gem in its constitution until  when the japanese came they promptly committed the transgression of being too industrious and they had to be told their place the infamous land acts of  and  prohibited japanese from owning or leasing farm land though they were sought after as hands at token wages and lands already acquired by them passed to the state these laws which withstood constitutional condemnation until after world war ii served as models for similar land acts throughout the west but california will shine brightest in the segregationist heaven for showing how to make restrictive covenants work since the ancient origin of the land deed property owners had been loading them with covenants saying the estate could be sold only to a certain class or race but how to make them stick had eluded the cleverest minds down through the agesuntil a san diego lawyer thought of asking courts to enforce them the scheme failed when an appeal court ruled that the covenant in questiona bar on chineseviolated the th amendment but gold had been glimpsed and the san diego example set off a chain reaction of similar suits across the country finally in  a louisiana suit succeeded and the negro owner of a raciallyrestricted property was ordered to vacate it everywhere lower courts obliged with similar eviction orders in some states however as in california appeal courts upset the evictions ruling that racial restrictions against sale or rental violated the th amendment then a los angeles lawyer cleared that road block he was inspired to test a covenant that contained in addition to restrictions on sale and rental additional ones on use and occupancy eureka the court ruled that while the former restrictions were unconstitutional the latter two were not therefore the chinese owner of the property in question could not be forced to surrender his deed but he could beand was barred from residing on his property or conducting business on it where restrictive covenants had failed they began working again when injected with use and occupancy clauses they did that is until  when the supreme court upset the whole apple cart by declaring all four racial restrictions to be unconstitutional but all was not lost as milpitas california soon demonstrated during the s that small bay area city became a veritable showcase of how to segregate sans covenants when negro employees of ford motor companys milpitas plant were unable to find housing the united auto workers decided to build an integrated housing project to accommodate them a suitable tract was found outside milpitas but the land was swiftly rezoned for industrial use at a second site authorities refused to approve the subdivision plan a start on a third site brought a sudden upgrading of building regulations when a fourth site was stymied the builder gave up and withdrew after searching four years the union finally persuaded another builder to tackle the milpitas obstacle course only to have the sewer connection fee hiked to a ransom  but that outrage caused a clamor that brought state action only direct intervention by the attorney general permitted the builder to construct the project these are a few of the legalized barbed fences which the campaign of confusion painted as our free housing market that has had its indemic freedoms abused of course the negro like the oriental is not confused as to whether the real estate market has been open and competitive or closed and restrictive he knows he is forced to buy from a small fenced segment of it where a dollar buys less than in the market from which he is barred nor is the negro confused about which is the basic property right the right to buy or the right to sell knowing he cant sell property until he owns property he sees travesty in the claimed right to sell in a restricted way that robs him of his right to buy one who has been bruised by such a right knows it is not a right but a privilegea privilege those in power have granted to themselves yet californias negroes and its other minorities are not without allies alongside californias his  torical racist strain has dwelled a hardheaded egalitarian breed which has demanded that all humans be treated decently and these opposites sometimes give the state the appearance of advanced schizophrenia a coalition of minorities and liberals have been able to win some important battlesrepealing the infamous land acts and zoning ordinances clearing the way for integrated housing in milpitas and passing the two fair housing laws and the war is not over currently this coalition is huddling in strategy sessions and reconnoitering for an assault on the enemys new stronghold which it will not admit to be impregnable tentative plans call for a barrage of carefullylaid lawsuits to test the federal constitutionality of the racist statute which so long as it exists gives the lie to californias claim to an open society
the legislation we have j long awaited was final jj ly passed but the  v ybk struggle is not yet over in the months and years ahead we must resolve in fact what the civil_rights act is resolving in law the common enemy remains the enemy is segregationand segregation hurts us all whether it be blatant in the south or subtle in the north it saps and diminishes democracy and justice let us be clear about segregation whether it exists by law or by custom by edict or by tradition by patterns of employment or patterns of housing segregation hurts our children negro and white alike and nowhere is this damage more devastating than in education for democracy the war against segregation is a single war but all too often it is waged on many flanks which are secondary to our objective the elimination of racial discrimination in education these flanking skirmishes take place over neighborhood schools over mobile classrooms over compensatory education    and even over the use of a school bus these secondary struggles confuse and divide and frustrate our primary purpose they lead citizens of good will to take passionate issue on one side or the other    to become rigid inflexible and frozen  to forget what the enemy is and where the enemy stands the shortsightedness of many the recklessness of some is seen when good and allied policies of education are turned one against the other when the justice of integration takes a collision course against the quality of education let us examine these flanking skirmishes which lead us away from our prime objective first the neighborhood school in some cities the neighborhood school has been used as an instrument to perpetrate segregation turning our struggle for integration into a condemnation of the neighborhood school and all its works to be sure some who extol the neighborhood school do so because they abhor integration but many who defend the neighborhood school genuine desire a school sensibly close to home so conflict arises positions are taken motives are impugned and a smoke screen goes up to protect the enemy yet the neighborhood school and the integrated school are not incompatible both are good they should go hand in hand whenever possible if we must choose between them we choose integration but why must we choose we must work for both integration and the neighborhood school simultaneously we must achieve each to the greatest  degree possible second the mobile classroom in some cities portable extensionsmobile classroomsmerely enlarge the segregated school expanding and containing the ghettos of education turning our struggle for integration into another skirmish this isnt mobility this is merely anchoring the status quo but mobile classrooms can be used as integrated preschool centers and reading centers they can be used for these services as an instrument toward integration the misuse of mobile classrooms does not make them bad in themselves any more than the misuse of neighborhood schools makes them bad in themselves the mobile classroom and integrated education are not incompatible the mobile classroom can play a useful affirmative role if we must choose we choose integration but why must we choose let us use mobile classrooms to achieve a greater degree of integration and quality education third compensatory education a highquality highintensity program of the very best education we can provide for those who need it mostthe children of discrimination poverty and neglect in some cities compensatory education like the neighborhood school and the mobile classroom is misused is employed as an excuse to put off and postpone integration and our struggle for integration is once again turned into a senseless flanking fight yet compensatory education and integrated education are not incompatible they are logical effective paths to precisely the same objective but here once more they have been represented as two sides of an argument and we are maneuvered into taking senseless positions if we must choose we choose integration but why must we choose we need both compensatory education and integrated education at one and the same time fourth and last is bussing and here the smoke screen is densest of all bussing is an unfortunate word it has been used in unfortunate ways when those who oppose integration speak of bussing they almost always paint a picture of school children traveling for hours and hours and miles and miles until there is little time or appetite left for school such trips to nowhere are not envisioned by the most ardent supporters of bussing a school bus of course is a means of transportation and transportation is a means of getting children to school it can also be a logical reasonable way to increase integration in some of our cities but a school bus is not a policy or a panacea the question remains what is the most effective approach to desegregation in a given city in a given school system if we must choose between segregated schools and the school bus as a vehicle toward integration negro digest march s then we must choose for the school bus and see that it is headed in the right direction and we must head in the right direction ourselves to end for all time the blight of segregation wherever it exists and in whatever forms and shapes it assumes when the enemy becomes the neighborhood school policy when the enemy becomes compensatory education whenin an ultimate kind of madnessthe enemy becomes the school itself segregation gains and all of us lose by turning once and for all from these distracting issues we shall find in ourselves and in our schools an alliance that can be strengthened and will prevail schoolmen and educators everywhere must come to realize that their natural interests lie along the road to full equality for all our citizens that our schools can teach no lesson more important for all our children than integration that they must do far more than they have ever done to see that our schools are leadersnot followersin the struggle to eliminate segregation and civil_rights leaders too must reassess their relations with the schools they must recognize that all too vital energies can be dissipated in false skirmishes they must not merely be veto groups they must move from the position of naysayer and yeasayer into creative positions saying this is what we wantbecause good education demands it all civil_rights organizations as some have should study and know about nongraded school organization about team teaching about the model school system about the experimental programs now being advanced about ways to bring all our young people toward the highest levels of education of which they are capable essential to our success in the years ahead is a working partnership between education and the civil_rights movement in carrying forward our present momentum for change we can expect that there will be strains and stresses and initial misunderstandings but these creative tensions are always vital to the process of progress our schools should be can be the peoples major instrument to democratize society to give substance and meaning to the promise of america when the creative energies of the civil_rights movement are allied and joined with the best traditions of american education then we shall find beyond legislation for equality the reality of equalityin education and in every other realm of our lives
taken strictly as a poet leroi jones poems should be considered in a literary context for instance he is not a jazz poet he is not a negro poet he is not a race post as in so far as he was a poet at all richard wright was a race poet jones is not i mean a jazz poet in the sense that kenneth rexroth tries to be but when i say he is not a negro poet i mean that he is not one in the sense that paul laurence dunbar was now by placing jones work in the literary context i mean that he suceeds as a poet struggling with form and with meaning in his poems this is very clear he is a poet in the sense that kenneth patchen is a poet in the same sense that robert creely is a poet concerned with form jones may not be as accomplished a poet as creeley but he is surely in that range leroi jones titles are always good good and interesting in a poetic sense titles like a poem some people will have to understand and the insidious dr fu man chu have the necessary elements of mystery though they reek of what is often called the new american language advocated by dr william carlos williams et al the poem as an art form demands titles have to be creative too and jones well realizes this ake up wake up w boys pa was gently rolling us back and forth grinning his mischief through his toothstudded purple gums get up and  help your mama it was lunchtime again and pa always walked back to the house for a hot meal because cold biscuits and eggs choke me near to death hed say now he was bending over us his seamed and lumpy face looking so much like a roughfinished bust with scrape marks of the sculptors spatula still on itrousing us for our midday chores pa was tall and a bit stooped and coal dust blackened every crack and ravine in his face and body but he was gentle and good and comforting except on his rare occasions of anger he was very angry the time he caught us throwing rocks down into the blackberry pit hed scooped us up one under each arm my brother herman and me and stormed down slades road to our house and into our room his usually squinting eyes flared wide and bloodshot as he banged shut the door threw us to the plank floor and took off his belt in one motion his nostrils quivered coltlike as he strapped us til we burned all over and ma had to come and make him stop you leave em alone leave em alone and they wont bother us he wheezed through his angry teeth and through his anger we saw fear wed never seen pa afraid before the time old man sim had come to our house to beat us because we had bloodied his boys nose for calling us niggers pa had stood up real tall you get the hell  outta my house or i throws you out and old sim had left red as a poker iron another time sheriff jenkins had come to the door with luke sedges who owned the mine and called pa out into the yard and asked him about some union agitator who was stirring up the men pa shook his head though we boys knew the man had stayed with us for two nights pa never explained to us when it was good to lie and when it was bad  blackberry pit was an old deserted openpit mine that had been worked out before we were born now it was overgrown with sassafras and blackberry bushes clear down to the bottom the floor of the pit was shaley and mosaiclike with white clay and rusty dust it was a kind of irregular amphitheatre relentlessly encroached with underbrush and the best blackberries in newton grew there also the biggest rattlers the pit was fested with the snakes they retreated to the shelter of the roots and stones in the bottom on warm days theyd come out into the west virginia sun to sleep and stretch one evening we counted twentyone squirming and lazing in the dust below all of the kids were forbidden to trespass even the upper rim of the pit superstition about snakes and the concomitant fears were grounded deep in the community folklore and the respect paid the pit was close to the character of primitive tribal religion of course young innocence and curiosity always make blasphemers of children the pit was well harvested despite parental taboo one day we gathered our army and laid siege to the pit and threw rocks down there to see if the snakes would get mad and come up and kill the whole town we werent afraid even if the grownups were our army would destroy them then everybody would talk about how brave the boys had been the whole neighborhood would go picking all the way down to the bottom after the battle down there the berries were as big as your thumb there would be berry cobblers with buttery crusts bubbling in the coal stove ovens juicy dumplings steaming in iron pots puffing spices and sugar smells all over the kitchen and thered be rich black jam and biscuits and sweet butter and heady blackberry wine pa cut our dreams short and chased the other kids home every buttock under sixteen was sore that night herman and i gave each other knowing glances when we got up aw pa and we put the mattresses back on the bedsprings i was to help ma hang the clothes while herman took script to the commissary for cheese and flour after chores we and the gorham boys and ned stevens were going berrypicking five left out of that gallant company of two

buckets we were late the others were already at the pit we were going to the picnic grounds afterwards to devour the forbidden fruits up ahead ned stevens who was fourteen and older than the rest of us stood beckoning us on herman was thirteen and he and ned were rivals for leadership ned led by his wits but herman was stronger and big ger hey jim herman come on where ya been all this time aw

loud eeeeee eeeeee   and we couldnt tell anymore whether he was moving or just twitching from the fangblows as the snakes kept on striking and bobbing and dancing up little puffs of gray dust and whirring the rattles on their angry tails a long shout from the mine whistle blasted away the spell the gorham boys had run all the way to the mine for help an old company truck growled and rattled

together jesus    lawdy gimme back my ned jesus help me help me help me jeeee    suss and when we crept furtively to the door we saw ma stevens down the dustquilted road rolling and tearing at her bosom as though her agony had been made molten like hot lava and poured searing and scalding over her breasts then ma came in from the back and wrapped an arm about each of us and hugged us ever so tight eat your bread and milk boys when we finished we tipped to our room made the pallets and went to sleep as for me i slept deeply and dreamlessly till i was awakened by what sounded like thunder dynamiting the pit cant get the boy out they still sleep yes said ma im glad said pa  
although many racial barriers have fallen and others are in the process of decay the area of marriage remains one in which negroes and whites are clearly separated by the law this is true not only throughout the south but in a number of other states as well in some of these states interracial marriages are classified as misdemeanors and in others they  are felonies in all states prohibiting miscegenous marriages such unions are declared to be null and void thus we see that court decisions integrating municipal golf courses and swimming pools and civil_rights acts affecting areas of public accommodation have not in any way lessened either the effectiveness or the legality of state laws prohibiting marriage between individuals of different races the supreme court has never ruled on the constitutionality of such laws and until  no statute of this kind had ever been stricken by a state court a number of such statutes have been upheld within the past several years miscegenation legislation has a long history extending back to the very beginnings of the american legal system a look at this history will enable us to view the current legal question in some perspective the first law banning mixed marriages was passed in  by the colony of maryland virginia followed in  with a statute providing that a white man having a bastard by a negro or mulatto should pay a fine of  pounds or in default of payment be sold for five years it also punished such women for marriage to a negro a mulatto or indian massachusetts enacted its first antimiscegenation statute in  followed by delaware  pennsylvania  and north carolina  by  thirty states forbade miscegenation and the penalties provided for the violation of these laws varied from imprisonment for a few months to a term of up to ten years and fines ranging up to  californias antimiscegenation statute dates from its first legislative session though frequently attacked on constitutional grounds they have always been upheld as a valid state regulation until recent times as of  miscegenous marriages were felonies in these states alabama florida georgia indiana maryland mississippi missouri oregon south dakota tennessee and texas they were misdemeanors in delaware nevada south carolina west virginia and wyoming as late as  twentyfour states maintained prohibitions against miscegenous marriages prior to  fourteen states repealed antimiscegenation statutes these states are iowa kansas maine massachusetts michigan new mexico ohio rhode island washington north dakota south dakota oregon colorado and montana the exercise of control over the marriage relation by the states dates back to our earliest legal decisions as early as  chief justice john marshall pointed out that all of our marriage and divorce laws    are state laws and state statutes the national power with us not having legislative or judicial cognizance of the matter within these localities the control of the state in this area seems to have been almost beyond question in  the supreme court noted that marriage as creating the most important relation in life as having more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any other institution has always been subject to the control of state legislatures control however cannot be an unreasonable control in the case of american sugar refining company v louisiana the court stated that   the doctrine of legislative control does not carry with it the right to enact race and class legislation such legislation may not be discriminatory irrational with no legitimate end but rather an unreasonable expression of popular prejudice courts which have upheld miscegenation statutes have pointed to the allegedly valid reason for their establishment and enforcement in scott v georgia it was held that the amalgamation of the races was not only unnatural but is always productive of deplorable results the decision said that our daily observation shows us that the offspring of these unnatural connections are generally sickly and effeminate and that they are inferior to the fullblooded of either race in physical development and strength    in an early missouri case state v jackson it was held that mixed unions were incapable of reproduction later courts merely followed this precedent the courts often talk in general terms declaring that it is well established law that such statutes are a proper exercise of the states police power often substantiating this by analogy to statutes prohibiting incestuous marriages polygamy and restrictions based upon age the first case involving miscegenation to reach the supreme court and the only one to be decided on the merits to date was pace v alabama the case was  tried under an indictment charging the defendants a white and negro with cohabitation in violation of the alabama code the code provided heavier penalties for interracial cohabitation than for the same offense by members of the same race the court ruled that it was constitutional and speaking through mr justice field said    indeed the offense    cannot be committed without involving persons of both races in the same punishment    the punishment of each offending person whether white or black is the same among the state cases directly upholding these statutes as valid are kirby v kirby an arizona case which holds that marriage is purely a subject for state regulation dodson v state an arkansas case which holds that marriage is subject to the state police power green v state an alabama case which states that god made black and white different and meant them to be separate and state v gibson an indiana case holding that natural law forbids racial intermarriage in a significant case meyer v nebraska the right to marry is said to be protected by the due process clause and cannot be infringed upon by action that is arbitrary and bears no reasonable relation to legitimate legislative objectives the argument advanced most frequently to justify legislation prohibiting interracial marriage is that of nonwhite mental and physical inferiority the reasoning of a judge sitting on the tennessee supreme court is typical we know that the complainants   belong to a race but recently emancipated from slavery that as a race they are far below the white man in intelligence another contention to prove that these states have a reasonable relation to some purpose within the competence of a statute to effect a reasonable regulation is the idea that racial intermarriage would produce such strong and widespread group feelings and racial repulsions and antagonisms as to threaten the security and tranquillity of the state scientific knowledge concerning the nature of race and the inherent abilities of the races has been completely ignored in recent cases which sound as if they might have been written more than a century ago the famous naim v naim case provides an excellent example of this the court said we find in the constitution no requirements that the states shall not legislate to prevent the obliteration of racial pride but must permit the corruption of blood even though it weaken or destroy the quality of its citizenship    this case which was decided in  makes references to racial pride and corruption of blood reminiscent of earlier decisions in  the supreme court of california in the case of perez v sharp struck down that states miscegenation statute the court stated the regulation of marriage is considered a proper function of the state if a regulation is directed at a social evil and employs a reasonable means to prevent that evil it is valid regardless of its incidental effect upon the conduct of particular groups    the right to marry is as fundamental as the right to send ones child to a particular school or the right to have offspring a statute that prohibits an individual from marrying a member of a race other than his own restricts the scope of his choice and thereby restricts his right to marry distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality the right to marry is the right of individuals not of racial groups the equal protection clause of the united states constitution does not refer to the rights of the negro race the caucasian race or any other race but to the rights of the individuals the argument of those courts which have upheld miscegenation statutes on the grounds that they are necessary for the public peace and order would seem even less persuasive when viewed against the  holding of the supreme court in cantwell v connecticut the court held in every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not in attaining a permissible end unduly to infringe the protected freedom    the danger in  these times from the coercive activities of those who in the delusion of racial or religious conceit would incite violence and breaches of the peace in order to deprive others of their equal right to the exercise of their liberties is emphasized by events familiar to all   the supreme court has finally agreed to hear a case which deals with the question of miscegenation statutes in  a florida court upheld a statute which proscribed cohabitation by persons of different races the court concluded its opinion in mclaughlin v state by setting forth its views concerning miscegenation statutes it said if the newfound concept of social justice has outdated the law of the land    and by consequence some new law is necessary it must be enacted by legislative process or some other court must write it the florida court felt that it was obligated to uphold miscegenation statutes by the sound rule of the stare decises and the precedent of past decisions this is the case which the supreme court heard and ruled on last december it avoided the greater issue of those statutes prohibiting interracial marriage itself ruling only that the florida law prohibiting interracial cohabitation was unconstitutional but most observers believe that the court will strike down all such laws  it is admittedly up to the states to establish a public policy concerning the marriage relation if we accept the view that such policies may be based upon whim or prejudice however we might decide that it is wrong for baptists to marry presbyterians or catholics to marry lutherans or jews to marry methodists no end is in sight when men may write their prejudices into the law with no standard to meet we have ceased to be a society of law and have become a society ruled merely by men discussing the possible aftermath of an elimination of the various miscegenation statutes an article in the university of illinois law review presented this assessment    although emotion dictates that the consequence of a sweeping invalidation of interracial marriage statutes would be widespread other indications are to the contrary    human behaviour in the area of sex is not basically motivated by a careful regard for the statute book above and beyond considerations of racial equality all who defend such laws must remember the legal axiom that a law should cease when the reason for the law has been removed a scientific view that holds the races to be inferior has been cast aside the idea that government may deny rights to people because allowing them their rights may cause trouble has also been abandoned the marriage relation is within the realm of state authority but every restriction must have a reason once these two ancient reasons for prohibiting racial intermarriage have been removed only prejudice remains to enforce them

dont get yourself iny volved in the racial troubles of the couno was the recurring advice i received prior to my departure for this country scores of people must have said to me in almost the same words so when i reached the airport in new york my first step on american soil seemed to have encored those identical words i almost said aloud i wont please i was determined not to become involved as i had promised my wellwishers at home not knowing that as long as i came along with my skin there was no way out of it it is a year now since i left home and within this short time not only have i heard and read so much about the racial discrimination of this country but i also have had occasion to experience it personally i now know what an awful experience it is most of the racial friction that one comes in contact with is that between the white and the colored people one rarely hears of discrimination among negroes themselves there are negroes whose color is on the borderline between white and black and if given a choice some of them would rather choose to be classified as whites from what i have seen here in manhattan kansas it seems there are two categories of negroes white negroes and regular negroes negroes who due to some unfortunate circumstances were born with a very light skin seem to regard themselves as a more privileged class of negroes than those with a darker skin this is something i cannot understand i first noticed this attitude on our campus  observed that most of the white negroes prefer the company of either white americans or other white negroes and the black negroes kept to themselves the black negroes in turn loathe the company of african students this to me indicates that some of these negroes regard the whites as superior to the blacks by virtue of their white skin and that is precisely what some people have dedicated their lives to correct or is it not outside the campus the situation is not any better downtown i usually see negro couples who seem to pair up according to their color this looks so intentional that i find it difficult to dismiss as merely coincidental of course there is nothing wrong with this as long as it is coincidental but it is when the choice is made with a definite preference to a lighter skin that  find it objectionable this white preferentialism is perhaps more noticeable in the negro clubs here it is very rare to see a very darkskinned negro boy with a very lightcolored girl in fact one of the boys i met in the club told me in the course of a conversation that among the negro boys there is a mad rush for any girl with a light skin and the lighter her skin the more keen the competition for her the girls too scramble to win the favors of a boy with a white skin just what is all this about i cannot imagine a more inappropriate time for this fashion craze it is bad enough for whites to discriminate against blacks and vice versa but is it not ridiculous for blacks to despise other blacks because of a slight difference in intensity of skin pigmentation is this situation helping the fight for racial equality what is wrong with the black skin that one should be ashamed of it i think god made the right choice in everybodys color and i dont believe one is superior to the other in fact my dark skin is one of the things i have that i can be proud of while this mania may not be sufficiently obvious to the indigenous citizens we should remember that we do not always see ourselves as others see us it may all turn out to be a peculiarity of the negroes in this community alone but there may be a danger of its spreading to infect some healthy societies i do sincerely hope that this situation does not exist among negroes in other parts of the country let us all wear our skin with dignity and pride for black is the right color for us
she came across the front promenade of the upper tier of the park behind the library at th ave and nd st she walked slowly looking up with unhappy little eyes at the idlers lounging and leaning against the benches and balustrades on both sides of her of all that polyglot crowd escaping the hateful june sun by crowding into the shade of the park trees she was unquestionably the tiniest and most spectacular she stood under five feet and her thin body and fleshless legs attested to her need of proper food and care even if her face which was oddly fat and rosy denied it as she neared the spot where i stood where the balustrades broke into a stairway leading to the parks lower tier i saw that her skin was unhealthily yellow beneath the rouge that the uncombed fragments of hair which hung from under a onceelegant embroidered hat were in need of fresh henna and that her faded cotton frock her woolen jacket and unseasonably heavy cotton hose were exceedingly dirty i admit i stared at her seeing the womans busted nearsoleless shoes i suddenly thought of my own mother who must have been this womans age and who has even now an unconquerable passion for shoes in almost such a state of disrepair i felt a great compassion and sympathy for the little woman i had been occupied with the approach of the disreputable brown oxfords when i raised my head and looked straight into her slategray eyes she stopped a few feet in front of me and spread her shapeless little legs thrusting her hands to her hips in a startling motion and while i stood looking at her the dull eyes flashed like steel blue flames her tight little mouth opened revealing three or four tobaccobrowned teeth and a coarse incongruous voice spat out at me you black sonof  abitch standing there rolling your eyes at me dont blame me cause im white and youre black that said she puckered her thin lips as if spitting or me then continued haughtily down the steps and through the park lane without changing her leisurely pace on one of those warm sunny october days in florence  found myself wandering about the narrow streets of the old city keeping always within reasonable proximity to the puny arno so as not to get lost i went unnoticed over the cobblestones between gray and crumbling buildings for most italians had long since accustomed themselves to the presence of all shapes and sizes and colors of soldiers but when i emerged from a sunless thoroughfare we in america would call it an alley just at the base of the rambling and imposing stairway of the pitti palace i met a spunky little old lady who did notice me i had no idea of her age other than that she was beyond sixty she had not one tooth in her head and apparently had had none for a great many years but she had striking little blueblack eyes and an aggressive chin untidy and lustreless gray hair and a beaked nose like the ones all witches are supposed to have she was barely five feet tall and she wore a faded black sack of a frock which though not large was like a tent over her slight frame she flashed her charming toothless smile at me and irather ashamed at the moment of my strong set of natural foodgnashers smiled down at her she abruptly reached out her bronzed and bony right hand and took my left hand her strength was quite as surprising as this unexpected maneuver but not nearly so surprising as what she went on to do her other hand slid along the right side of my face and the rough fingers experimentally touched my lips all the time a stream of language poured forth from her throat in a low liquid tone but the only words i recognized were nero black and belli denti beautiful teeth then satisfied i was not an apparition she suddenly gripped me behind the neck and pulled me forward and downward and before i had time to think anything at all she kissed me dryly on the cheek and released me she stood there for a moment afterwards composed and smiling while i felt flushed and foolish when her hand moved toward me again i started but she merely gave my arm three very gentle pats and still smiling alluringly said arrivedici and glided resolutely down the dim alley of a street
the average fan of marian anderson greeted with the rumor that she will retire this year reacts rather as if he had been told that the statue of liberty had decided to take a seat the singer draws a careful distinction between her announced farewell tour and retirement i have never said i would retire she explains all the announcements have carefully called this a farewell tour to retire means you put the lid on this and its finished but reactions to the news have given her great happiness i was leaving a store the other day with a package tucked under my arm and i heard this voice behind me saying yous quittiny i didnt turn around and it said again yous quittiny i looked and saw it was a sales girl not of my race this time she looked at me accusingly and said yous quittin you cant do that i know that you cant always sing but it is not like a faucet you can turn off and say this is it if it was many people would have found it easy to stop and not come back to make those endless series of farewell tours if you are not to be exclusively involved in singing one believes this is the way to do it not by giving a few less concerts each year until you finally give just one people keep asking you what you are going to do afterwards we thought one would like to work with children the idea is to be of service one does not want to sit and hold her hands it would be work for the young who cannot get help the world and people are so uncertain it is not easy to find foster homes when things are so uncertain so precarious but one thinks many people would take children if foster homes were explained to them in a different way this plan helps the doer and then the community and then the state and finally the whole government one cant be paid back it is a thing of the heart and of the soul miss anderson was sitting in the living room of the ranch house her architect husband built in the connecticut hills she was wearing a dress of navy blue chiffon with white polka dots and navy blue sneakers and may well be the only woman in the world who can somehow make sneakers elegant it is a fascinating thing in talking to her to find how aware one is forced to become of her eyes her face is strong and exquisitely modeled but over and over again the listener is made aware of her eyes dark liquid and infinitely expressive suddenly you know that whatever her own reason is for singing so often with her eyes closed it is just as well because if you watch these eloquent eyes you might find it difficult to hear the music and although the nature of her  artistry has never made miss anderson noted for comical gifts she has for punctuation of a joke one of the best winks in the business perhaps her dedication to the fate of children was begun a few years ago when she went back to the philadelphia neighborhood where she grew up there were beautiful big brownstones now even the rooms were cut up you find two families living in one divided room a child  or  is taking care of the little ones while the parents work where do you suppose a childs mind is she cant wait for the day to get out of school for good we think a great deal is lost in not letting them be susceptible to the good things as well as the bad when you think of what one would like to do the area broadens all the time and you feel smaller and smaller and smaller we have not found yet the absolute niche in which one would hope to fit but it would be to help the young people in their teens and the young parents the older parents too if some sort of elevating entertainment could be arranged to find what they like and give them what makes them reach so many people wonder what they could do wonder what we could have done and didnt but you can t upbraid other people and you cant let others do it for you like peace it must begin in the heart and the soul the singer is well aware that this dream of hers is a matter for the future the tour of farewell this season opens next month in washington and will conclude easter sunday in new york but already there are requests from europe especially scandinavia where she made her first sensational successes and from south america there is also a proposal to sing in africa where she has never been she welcomes the idea of going back to places where she has sung before always with the hope that some day she may see something of the cities she whisked through so often it was a close miss arriving at six giving the concert and then away early the next morning one did not worry at the time but always felt one would come back you did not feel that the years were taking you with them then you realize youve been going along with them miss anderson takes apparent pleasure at this point of her career in recalling what her early hopes and ambitions were you see so many young people getting out of college rosy eyed the world is theirs and you wonder about  years later how many will get what they wanted at a very early age i knew music took absolute precedence at the start even when music was soft it drowned out any conversation for me one of the first desires i remember was to go away and sing not to leave my family but to travel and most of all it was in geometry class where i was a poor student and always thought this is the day i want to be on a train going away i prayed to the evening stars to have concerts and go away and in high school i prayed to sing at the metropolitan with that company there there wasnt enough money to go when it came to philadelphia but once my teacher advised me to find out about tickets when they told me how much the price was i answered but i only want onev  in agreeing that so often through her career her publicity has seemed impersonal the singer says one often talks of all the people who made this moment possible but then the selection is up to the reporter one has no control over it vehemently she recalls that it was utterly utterly hopeless to see mr hurok in new york when she first hoped to have him manage her and she likes to recount how by chance he finally came to hear her in paris we have never had a contract he would send me one but somehow i never signed it i would not advise this for other people but it has been our way that sentence ended with one of her best winks the history of the united states in the first half of this century will always be inextricably entwined with the career of marian anderson as a negro she endured many slights in the early days which undoubtedly accentuated her natural shyness but they could not have been more vividly counterbalanced than on that famous easter in  when at the lincoln memorial she sang to  people there is so much pride and joy in my people for the united states the only country they know there are all classes all kinds among negroes just like anyone else sometimes it is not thought that we think feel and see as others sometimes there are things unknown to a person who thinks he does not have prejudice a person in a strange place will look up and a frown comes on his forehead you say what your mission is but you generally dont know what to expect i was delivering something to an affair recently and in this hall a young woman looked up with furrows in her brow then someone said to her thats so and so then it was all right but you are not different after you are identified you are not taken at face value but you can only feel sorry for people who need these things to live on who havent found other things if one can be mean for any reason because a person is black or anything he can be mean to his own people if circumstances inspire it at home the singer is mrs orpheus fisher and she delights in telling how she arrived with her husband after the wedding and  heard him announce to the servants loudly anybody who calls my wife miss anderson gets fired prominent in the living room of the house is a beautiful long low table with drawers in it cut down from a sideboard bar in mr fishers workshop i found it in the back of an antique shop miss anderson recalls i ran my finger along the edge of it and then around the end and my heart began to go bump bump bump i got it home but i told my young man before he saw it that if he didnt like it i would take it back he said darling its wonderful then i kept getting up in the middle of the night to see if it was still there miss anderson has recorded for publication this winter a collection of spirituals hall johnson has a whole storehouse of them that have never been heard of the seven we talked about i had never even heard of five of them before a strong believer in the powers of affection the singer likes to tell of a friend who took a rose from her garden this new rose was given our name and a friend of mine took a bud in her car to new york and it drooped but she cared and restored it and it was as erect as can be so many things respond to the tiniest touch of consideration or love the recognition that you or it exists like a swelling theme the singer returns with her classic calm to the subject of prejudice you may think you know whats in anothers head but you dont if a man has an intelligent reason theres nothing wrong with him not liking one negro or all negroes but not if he does not have an intelligent reason you can put a stigma on a person so easily you can say theres a dangerous dog but remember that maybe the person he bit was someone who hit him
