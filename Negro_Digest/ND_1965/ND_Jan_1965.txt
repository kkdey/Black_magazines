more than  years ago abraham lincoln addressed himself to the duties of free men and free women in an age of rapid social change we cannot escape history he said    the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation these words were spoken a hundred years ago but they cut to the bone of our current dilemmaa dilemma which cannot be solved without the help of free individuals who stand up to the challenge presented by the men women and little children who are sitting down in the marketplace we stand today at a forking point in the american experience we are in the middle of a nonviolent social revolution that goes to the heart of our meaning as a people the social revolution speaks to usas individuals and as community leadersand we must respondas individuals and as community leaders if we are to make an effective contribution to the continuation and the strengthening of the democratic way of life the national urban league is the lengthened shadow of men and womennegro and whitewho rose to the challenge of their times the baldwins the hayneses the woods the joneses and the grangers made a great contribution not only to the negro but also to america and the urban league tradition of interracial affirmation is maintained today by the youngs and the steegers and the thousands of other americans who are reminding us of the holy dream we were to be for more than a half century the urban league has hammered away at the wall that distorts the personalities of both negro and white americans we stand on a new plateau today as a direct result of the efforts of the league and other organizations but much work remains to be done our citiesthe chief area of urban league service are threatened today as they have never been before millions of americans are fleeing the central city in a white panic and millions of negroes are being tossed and turned by the cold black wind of despair the demonstrations in the streets are reflections of a despair rooted in figures cited by a prominent american who said the negro baby born in america todayregardless of the section or state in which he is bornhas about onehalf as much chance of completing high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same dayonethird as much chance of completing collegeonethird as much chance of becoming a professional mantwice as much chance of becoming unemployed about oneseventh as much chance of earning  a yeara life expectancy which is seven years less and the prospects of earning only half as much malcolm_x didnt say that whitney young didnt say it james baldwin didnt say it john fitzgerald kennedy said it in a special message to congress and the statement contains a tremendous challenge to every individual american what can we do about this challenge more meetings more conferences i think not it seems to me that we will not make any real progress in this area until every individual assumes a personal responsibility for race relations in america in his book the ordeal of power emmett john hughes spoke of the cleansing anguish of responsibility and decision one of the great problems in all areas of american life is the lack of individual responsibility and commitment too many people say let george do it too many people are reluctant to take personal responsibility for hard decisions in the arenas of life they control the challenge we face today cannot be solved solely by education law or time but it cannot be solved without them we need law we need education we need time but most of all we need dedicated individuals carrying out the duties of free men and free women in their neighborhoods and offices free individuals  negro and whitecan make a real contribution to american democracy by challenging the distorted images that blind us to racial and social reality the biggest stumbling block to interracial peace in america is the distorted negro image that poisons communications at the very roots millions of white americans react not to negroes but to their image of negroes an image that has always been out of date and out of focus an indispensable prerequisite for racial progress in america is the abandonment of the traditional american error of confusing the negro image with the individual negroes who enter into our lives there are negroes of every conceivable description of every shape and size and color there are negro millionaires and negro paupers  negro phds and negro policemen and a strong negro middleclass which has grown by more than  per cent in the last ten years there is a tendency in america to put negro facts and white facts into separate compartments there is poverty and then there is negro poverty there is immorality and then there is negro immorality and the two things are almost always interpreted by different lights millions of american negroes for example are poor but so according to president johnson are  to  million american whites at this crucial hour there is a desperate need for adequate understanding and precise interpretation of the negro in human terms we suffer in america from a distressing lack of communication between negroes and whites i am appalled by the large number of businessmen and professional people who have never known a negro as a friend and who have never exchanged home visits with negro couples white americans can make a real contributionto themselves and to americaby crossing the berlin wall that divides us i would also urge a special effort to grasp the disadvantages of negro americans a disproportionate number of negroes are members of lowerincome groups where among all people crime and social disorganization flourish more negroes than whites proportionately are on welfare rolls because they cannot find gainful employment because for  years they have been the last hired and the first fired for too long now we have barred negroes from employment and condemned them for idleness for too long now we have barred negroes from the best schools and condemned them for illiteracy we must make a special effort to provide better educational and employment opportunities for negroes this effort will pay off in less crime less delinquency less maladjustment smaller tax bills and larger wholesale and retail revenue we can do these things and create garden cities for all americans if we abandon ghetto images and confront the human beings behind the myths that blind this is a task that recommends itself to both negroes and whites negroes have a responsibility to tell americans the truth about their lives and their aspirations in many areas they must take the first step in initiating a dialogue between real individuals who confront each other in truth in responsibility and in trust there is a similar need to upgrade the image of the white man millions of american negroes have never known a white man who was not insulting patronizing or exploitative we must make an immediate effort to stop the increasing polarization of american life based on the negative image of men who approach negroes with negative attitudes this will take deeds as well as words more negroes must be exposed to fairminded whites and fairminded whites must take the lead in debunking the widelyheld view that most white americans have a linein their hearts or in their neighborhoods  beyond which they are not willing for negroes to go this whole problem of images negative and positiveis a responsibility of individual men and women as community leaders we must take the lead in redefining the negro and the white image in the process we will create an image not of the negro or the white man but an image of the americanneither white nor black jew nor gentile the urban league has made a great contribution in this area by insisting on interracial cooperation the league has exposed thousands of negroes and whites to sensitive members of the other race more importantly the negro community through the league has received a positive image of whites and negroes working together for the advancement of all people the urban league approach is as sound today as it was  years ago there is an even greater need today for conciliation negotiation and preparation we need organizations to open doors but we still need an organization to prepare men to enter the doors and to negotiate with the men who open and close doors the league will play an even greater role in the years to come for what is at stake in the social revolution is the urban foundation of our urban civilization we have reached a point in america where we cannot continue business as usual the first order of business in america today is the salvation of the american city and the american city cannot be saved if we do not face the challenge and the opportunity of the urban negro there has been a great deal of comment recently about the tactics of different organizations most of the comments i think miss the basic point no army is composed entirely of foot soldiers men have different gifts and different insights some men are not fitted by instinct temperament or training for the front lines but we have a right to ask them to fight somewhere every individual ought to be involved at some levelif not on the firing line then at the conference table if not at the conference table then in logistics or supply giving money attending meetings holding up the right arm of the steegers and the youngs this campaign must be deepened and extended it will be necessary to interpret the negro to the white man and the white man to the negro but it will also be necessary to act to know and not to do an old proverb says is in fact not to know negroes today are judging men by what they do and not by what they say it is no longer possible to buy negroes off with token appointments and token commitments it is no longer possible to buy them off with rhetoric a deed is required  in the italian film general della rovere there was an interesting scene that dramatized this whole problem of individual responsibility it was during the german occupation of italy and the nazis rounded up a group of people in a frantic effort to crush the resistance movement some of the people caught in the dragnet were members and leaders of the resistance but some were not the officer in charge tried to identify the resistance leaders and failed so he decided to shoot them allleaders and innocent bystanders on a cold morning the men were taken to a room to await their execution one man cried out in anguish im innocent i didnt do anything a resistance leader approached him and said you didnt do anything the man said no l didnt do anything the resistance leader said i dont understand our way of life was being destroyed minds were being warped babies jews christians and old men and women were being killed and you didnt do anything the man replied no i didnt do anything the resistance leader declared if you didnt do anything then you deserve to be shot what are you doing minds are being warped babies are dying jews christians and old men and women are being humiliated degraded and excluded what have you done to be human in this crucial age is to be precisely responsibleand no man can avoid the hard claims of responsibility by not acting this fight in the final analysis will be won or lost not by organizations although organizations are needed not by conferences although conferences are useful not by study groups although study groups serve a purpose not by tens and twenties and fifties but by individual men and women accepting responsibility for unpopular decisions in their neighborhoods offices clubs synagogues and churches we must not deceive ourselves we act now not for the negro but for america not for civil_rights but for the city not for love but for economic salvation and the preservation of the democratic way of life
the road is not so rough as it once was no longer will chained men walk it to their dusty deaths no longer is it suffused by the dense air of suppression or overshadowed by hopelessness and despair for the road has wound up from the valley of depression to a mountain a summit of hope and it leads on to the peak that we seek to attainfreedomfor once forever and for all  and on this mountain the air is so much sweeter the light is brighter and each dawn brings another ray of hope here a man can have a dream and walk with head held high for he knows that his dream will come true by and by he knows that his people have been unwilling actors in an unworthy play but he also knows that the curtain of justice is descending on this improper stage this struggle in which we are engaged began long ago we are continuing a journey that started long before they who began that struggle are now all gone and the first step of that journey was taken before you and i were born in our past there are those who pointed out the way and who led us through the darkness to the dawn of this new day the things of which they dreamed are now being accomplished by our race but it was their dreams and labor that led us here to this high place now let us pause for a moment as we stand here at this summit and look down the path stretching back away from us can you see the rocky road winding down into the depths where once we walked in a desolating smog can you see the rusty chains laying in the dusty plains where men struggled and threw their shackles off look at the pitfalls that were missed at the barriers that were climbed and at the crossless graves scattered along the way can you see where the dust has settled in spotssome wet some redfrom the blood and from the tears that were shed as you gaze down the path do the winds from the past bring ancient sounds to your earsthe anguished moans the tearful groans and in the wake of freedom the cheers do the winds bring the sounds of the hopeful songs that were sung and the faithful prayers that were prayed the hope in those songs and the faith in those prayers fired the torches that lit the way for those who guided us down that rocky road to this mountain we stand on today the view from this mountain shows that old rugged road its traps and treacherous pits its hazardous surface and dangerous curves that wind through the dark ness unlit after viewing that road is it strange that we marvel at the strength of those who led us this far who gave their lifework and their lifeblood so that we could reach this place where we are for it was those old leaders and workers who blazed the trail that led us up from the deep and who gave their strength hope dreams wishes and prayers to you and me they who gave us all those things who counseled us as we walked by their sides are the ones we now thank for bringing us here and for being our old guides not only statesmen like frederick douglass or educators like mary mcleod bethune but also the ones who labored and sweated in fields in the burning sunthe ones whose names will not be mentioned by the men who write history but whose gifts will live forever in the hearts of you and me though the old guides have left and are leaving the things that they passed on will stay with the young leaders and workers who fearlessly stand up today for when you see a young woman sitting passively in a stream of curses abuses and threats do you wonder whose words laid the foundations for her pillars of patience and strength as she sits there with tears in her eyes withstanding degrading taunts whose patient old voice comes to her from the past whispering the lord is my shepherd i shall not want does she still hear the voice that she heard as a child the voice that quieted her cries that gave her faith and diminished her fears when she went down to be baptized water from a fire hose knocks a young man down but he rises to come forward again his body is kicked and beaten but his courage never wanes when men on horses come with cattle prods and when dogs come with slashing teeth the young man falls back but advances againfor him there can be no retreat what makes him push on in the face of such oddsfire hoses maddened dogs and men on horses with prods as he struggles does he remember a man who lifted him up with calloused hands and talked to him as a child could it be the words of that man which now give him courage to stand and demand the rights and freedoms that were never given to he with the colloused hands and when that young man enters schools which he never could before do you think of those who gave him the ways and means to reach those doors which old guides gave up so much and yet were so very glad to do without so he could acquire the things they never had who fed and sheltered that young man until he went forth to learn and who waited and watched through many long nights praying for his return the price those old guides paid so he could enter such places is symbolized by their calloused hands and the wrinkles in their faces those are just a few of the things that will endure throughout the years from the old guides we received other gifts too numerous to recount here but every one of the gifts that they handed down to us will be remembered cherished and held in sacred trust and the old guides who are with us now as the peak of freedom nears stand honored by all of us during their twilight years for today the guides are changing we now float upon another sea where those who were helped now help and where those who were led now lead the ones who sacrificed so much to see this moment come can look at the fruit of their labor and tell themselves well done as we stand on this mountain humble thanks we offer to those old guides who gave their all in enabling us to climb this mountain side and we raise grateful voices in a prayer from our hearts and minds to the old guides who are not here to witness this great time

why negro leaders lack power
for more than twenty years some social scientists have been predicting the civil insurrections oneway riots that leapfrogged through northern cities last summer their social barometers were activated by fairly obvious and widely familiar causes for example police brutality in every case illfeelings fostered by general oppression overcrowding unemployment social discontent the slowpaced civil_rights struggle social dynamite comprised of unemployed and frustrated youths loss of faith in the integrity of white people and established authority the growing worldwide insurgence of oppressed races and in the words of the swedish social scientist gunnar myrdal a growing realization by negroes that peaceful requests for their rights are not getting them anywhere why then was little or nothing done to remedy these conditions before or after riots my hypothesis is that the white men of power who of course have a vested interest in blindly diminishing the signs of revolution more about that later have had the inadvertent aid of negroes themselves particularly our leaders how has this occurred broncobusting leaders item negro leaders were booed down whenever they sought to speak out in restraint against the negro crowds one philadelphia leader was hit on the leg with a brick for his efforts just as a broncobusters job is to tame and corral unruly stallions the new breed of negro leaders it would seem have the function of riding herd on mass negro rebellion they manage with the help of the white press and politics to get in front of negro rebellion then call moratoriums until the end of the current political campaign or whenever it may suit the fancy of white men of power preferring to negotiate rather than demonstrate they have in the recent past called off the worlds fair stallins the christmas boycott and by editing speeches and other means watered down the march on washington from lieins and civil disobedience a la gandhi their professed messiah to little more than an ov ergrown parade of jolly vacationers who climaxed matters with a grand and glorious dream affirming loyalty to the belief in ultimate justice from white america rev martin_luther_king jr who along with roy wilkins the washington post reports was called in to dampen the march on washington also was brought in by new york city mayor robert wagner over the heads of local leaders during the harlem riots however rev king core leaders naacp officials and others with a mind to halt the rebellion were conspicuously powerless white people dictate your policy one heckler yelled to core leaders being booed down similar reactions were met by such responsible leaders as an exprizefighter in philadelphia a disc jockey and a famous comedian it appeared indeed that as malcolm_x and an ebony editorial have observed negroes in the northern slumsif they ever had anyare fast losing faith in the efficacy of nonviolence as the answer to their troubles conference table revolution another general pattern was a belated effort by white powerwielders to pump up as leaders negroes who before the riots had been largely ignored except for an occasional grant for launching some study or pilot project they were eagerly placed on ad hoc committees for postmortem analyses and rehashing of the problem sure enough uncle tomism was the order of the day the harlem committee or jury of twentythree that reviewed the charge against the white cop who lit the fuse for the riot contained two negroes one a goldwater backer who unanimously freed the policeman of all charges made by eyewitnesses an naacp leader decried phony militancy and asserted that some white people in childhood had it rough too others preoccupied with token concessions and a peaceatanyprice philosophy took to the conference table however this is customary after any negro uprising violent or nonviolent as is also the stage when frightened negroes and their leaders quickly become again all teeth graciously smiling to let whites know that all is forgiven lowrating the rioters item during the harlem riots a policeman stood on a street corner and yelled through a bullhorn why dont you go home a negro standing in the crowd yelled back were at home this is our home baby the policeman had been trapped as were negro leaders in a propaganda line to undermine the respectability of the rioters to defame what some negroes call lowrate the character of the participants the technique was namecalling rioters were labeled outsiders as if local groups of negroes could not rebel on their own other names given included extremist elements the lunatic fringe hoodlums professional agitators agitators approved by whites are called leaders some said that the black muslims had a hand in the riots except in localities where black muslim leaders themselves quickly joined the jittery bandwagon of negro leaders going on record that we do not believe in violence black nationalists and of course communists also were blamed for the riots in order to defame them even wayward youth came under fire despite the fact that youths first got the sitin movement underway and not so much was made of the welloff white youths who rioted at hampton beach new hampshire and seaside oregon then there was the fact that only a small percentage though they numbered often in the hundreds and thousands had taken an active part even so this is as good a record as the passive resistance movement has mustered on spontaneous occasions and a survey conducted by a professional polling firm found that eight out of  harlemites had never taken part in a nonviolent demonstration  but negro leaders while gleefully approving the above namecalling and defamation added factors such as goldwaters nomination wine liquor and the waning number of white liberalsanything to evade criticism of the white power structure one group of ministers a full month later even took a second look at a chance to pounce on personal sin and called for a mass turnout as a silent christian witness to indicate their opposition to the riots and their affirmation of faith in the status quo others avowed that negroes were forfeiting their moral suasion and negroes of all varieties rolled their eyes toward high heaven poked out their lips and alleged ttiats a shame set us back  years disgraceful to the colored race and the like along with whites some negroes were known to call it uncivilized behavior this said at a time when the worlds greatest modern civilizations are preoccupied with the preparation of mass war on a scale that makes the riots seem microscopic item leftists black nationalists and cultists were seized and raided often on tips from negro bigwigs on grounds that a couple of butcher knives an old rusty pistol and say a couple of beer bottles were found in their headquarters this despite the fact that the rioters even if organized were largely unarmed except for bricks and such readymade ammunition the arrests represented another technique what students of public opinion and propaganda call propaganda of the deed where no verbal statements are given but a deed is used to publicize the propaganda intended the tracking down of alleged culprits conveys the idea that the riots were ignited by no just grievance and were simply willfully stirred up for nothing  by deranged or irresponsible individuals item during the riots signs appeared in store windows such as this store owned and operated by black men and reportedly in the case of a chinese gentleman me colored too although defamers of the rioters clung to the factor of looting as the basis for the riots looting was selective restricted on the whole to white stores besides the rioters did not merely loot they also pulled fire alarms in some cases broke windows and overturned trash cans this is in the fashion of the boston tea party during the american revolution and suggests that while looting may have been a factor for some participants it was overplayed by the white press and negro leaders this was designed to keep the riots distinct from a civil_rights quest in the public mind civil_rights leaders were anxious that their organizations would not be hurt but they unwittingly played into the hands of the white men of power who do not wish to recognize or let the world know that the denial of negro rights was the chief factor but even the first riot in harlem grew out of a demonstration against the police force over the shooting of a negro boy by a white heavyweight policeman after a white custodian turned the hose on the boy and said he was going to wash the black off him also nonviolent groups held rallies and demonstrations but merely ran out when the slum negoes who thought the ranting middle class leaders actually meant business got a bit out of hand if i had known this was going to happen one turncoat leader moaned i wouldnt have said anything both groups violent and nonviolent were striving to demonstrate discontent not merely being unruly the civil_rights tie also is apparent in the fact that groups of negro teenagers between the intermittent flareups in harlem for example gathered on street corners and sang we shall overcome and similar civil_rights songs they previously had gone to the police station to protest but were blocked out by five policemen who locked their arms and refused to listen killers must go they shouted police brutality must   §o the semantics of revolution although a perusal of the literature on the french revolution notes striking similarities to the summer riots and the public reaction they provoked there was a curious endeavor by many to write off the revolutionary aspects of the riots this was accomplished by way of a suspicious exercise in semantics peaceful picketing and boycottingmethods used for centuries by nonrevolutionary labor unionslong have anxiously been labeled the negro revolution this technique allows negroes to believe that they are carrying on a revolution in order to keep them from really revolting likewise meek compromising though bellowing conservative negro leaders are widely hailed as militant i believe that the sitins when not corralled by sellout leaders and the riots are part of the beginning of the second stage of an emerging revolution rex hopper from a study of social revolutions throughout the history of the world has divided them into four typical stages the preliminary stage of individual excitement and unrest the popular stage of crowd excitement and unrest the formal stage and the institutional stage the second stage which we may now be undergoing is characterized by  the spread of discontent and the contagious extension of the several signs of unrest the riots that spread from harlem to brooklyn rochester jersey city elizabeth and patterson new jersey philadelphia kansas city and chicago  loss of faith in their leadership on the part of the repressed group and  the emergence of conflict with the outgroup in any case many of the aspects present in the riots and public reaction were as we said apparent during the french revolution there was in both selective looting and the ruling groups and the rioters own bourgeois allies similarly shouted bribery resorted to namecalling and set about track  ing down conspirators instead of removing the social grievances it is only a conspiracy of silence and wishful thinking that lead white men of power and their colored henchmen to ignore the revolutionary aspects of the riots while trying to shame negroes back into complacency they prefer to use their armed superiority and scientific propaganda to restore the situation to a semblance of tranquility ignoring the devastating problems behind the riots if they were in hungary tossing molotov cocktails at russian tanks says an ebony editorial white america would consider them heroes if they were in cuba defying castro white america would be saying the government should be sending help but be that as it may if the forces behind the riots are not soon removed the rebellion will again be ignited and exploded perhaps more resoundingly next time for as kenneth b clark psychology professor at the city college of new york said recently with reference to the riots i dont know whether the average negro leader can ask his race to be moderate any longer
this was the year when the negro struggle for equal rights moved out of americas alleys and into its main streets from mississippi courthouses and bronx lunch counters to the united states senate it was a noisy year but on a sweltering sunday last summer a handsome methodist minister rose in the pulpit of his newly assigned church in tucson arizona to deliver his first sermon to a congregation of strangers and with his soft carefully clipped syllables began an inspiring episode that earned scarcely a headline for the rev wilbur r johnson is a negro and his congregation is white as he spoke that first morning police cars cruised outside the pueblo gardens methodist church in answer to cowardly telephone threats that the church would be bombed if the new minister conducted the service but no bombs exploded and each sunday pastor johnson stands in the same pulpit on legs ravaged by polio and preaches to approximately the same congregation he faced last summerexcept that average attendance has risen nearly  per cent as the objects of an unprecedented experiment mr johnson his family and the  members of the little church knew that many eyes would be on them during their first year together not only methodists but leaders of other denominations were interested in bishop gerald kennedys bold plan to integrate a church beginning at the altar on june   without advance warning the yearold minister was reassigned from an allnegro congregation in compton california to pueblo gardens less than two weeks later he had moved his wife and two school age daughters into the tucson parsonage we hardly had time to think about it recalls one church member two years earlier the congregation had voted overwhelmingly to accept any minister sent by the  bishop regardless of his race but so had  other churches and by last summer the vote was nearly forgotten many expressed open shock at the bishops choice at first i was worried when some members disappeared admits mr johnson even before he arrived in tucson more than a dozen people threatened to leave if he showed up but show up he did and within a few weeks all but one family had drifted back the fears of one parishioner that the little cinder block church would suddenly be overwhelmed with new negro members proved groundless in fact to several lay leaders the only disappointment of their new ministers first year was that no more than two negroes came forward to join the church they are the only two now on the rolls pueblo gardens is a white neighborhood of modest homes and many children nearby is a tidy negro community the parish boundaries include both areas but until last year the negroes declined repeated invitations to worship with their white neighbors this appointment was not made purely on the basis of race nor was it merely a token of the churchs belief in civil equality said the rev dr chilton mcpheeters superintendent of the tucson district of the methodist church in clarifying the controversial assignment frankly i recommended the appointment to the bishop in the hope and belief that the right minister would place the pueblo gardens church in a better position to serve the total community apparently he was right mr johnsons success was confirmed this summer when bishop kennedy who heads the southern california and arizona conference of the church granted the wish of both the minister and his flock and reappointed him for another  months because it is in an admittedly low overhead part of town pueblo gardens has more than its share of struggling young couples and oldsters living on meager pensions both groups have special spiritual needs to be met by their pastor if by now people in all circumstances could not turn to me as their minister then i could have failed says pastor johnson allowing himself little room for shortcomings through its trial the parish has remained one of the leading small churches in the tucson district and continues to lead the districts  other congregations in per capita giving if only the whole world could see how things have worked out here in pueblo gardens i think it would be much easier for people everywhere else said one member who admits she was skeptical at first while he sees his first duty as that of spiritual leader of his church mr johnson is not silent on matters closer to earth than heaven and hell a longtime member of the national association for the advancement of colored people he heads the tucson chapters labor and industry committee which fights job discrimination and he is active in all naacp activities i was raised in california not alabama or mississippi and unlike many of my race i did not have a chip on my shoulder by the circumstances of my birth and upbringing the minister explains but where i see wrong i must fight it and today i see wrong everywhere i look i cannot be a docile uncle tom the only fullfledged racial skirmish to mar tucsons progressive record on civil_rights resulted last fall when mr johnson and three other ministers two of them white walked into a small downtown restaurant and ordered hamburgers they were refused service and civil_rights pickets soon were marching outside the eatery after nine days the owner capitulated and agreed to serve hungry patrons without regard for their color but pastor johnson was not among the first to test the agreement instead he had embarked on a threeday fast and prayer session for the conversion of alabama governor george wallace and in protest against the bombing of an alabama church in which six little negro girls were killed as seen by the minister the racial problems confronting both pueblo gardens and the nation are the same and do not involve skin color as much as they do cold economics white people are not as afraid of having a colored family move in next door as they are of losing money on their own property as a result he observes and there are peopleboth black and whitewho are willing to capitalize on this fear and line their pockets at the expense of society he doesnt like the words but what mr johnson is talking about is the unscrupulous practice of block busting by conscienceless realtors who use scare tactics to force property values down for their own advantage after my appointment several pueblo gardens residents were approached by men who offered to buy their homes the minister reports for a bargaining lever they used the thinly veiled threat that droves of negroes would soon follow me into the area and knock the bottom out of the real estate market the same tactics were used over several years to destroy two nearby neighborhoods one is now a slum and is fast becoming tucsons biggest problem from the police standpoint and mr johnson has seen identical forces at work gobbling up california neighborhoods lashing out one morning at block busters and slum lords the quietly exciting preacher declared greed and hate know no racial bounds and it is up to us here in pueblo gardens to prove that christian understanding also transcends that barrier and is even stronger so far the people of pueblo gardens have shown staunch stuff  three negro families beside the johnsons live among nearly  white families but they are there not as the unwanted guests of fear and prejudice instead they came because they wanted and could afford to move to a pleasant section and they are among the first to work to keep it that way a minister who is unafraid to carry his convictions to the pulpit with him mr johnson is esteemed by fellow clergymen as a spontaneous speaker who rarely loses his point in too many words but between sermons a parish pastor finds more intimate proving grounds for his faith than the pulpit the bedside of a dying parishioner or the kitchen of a woman on the verge of destroying herself because of family problems makes a sterner challenge than talking to a hundred or so sunday morning sleepy heads though he admits there have been anxious moments in his first year mr johnson reports no outright rebuffs by his congregation during house calls hospital visits or other duties during the very early days i could never be sure what filled the gulf between the altar and the pews the negro minister recalls it is a lot easier to accept someone at arms length than it is to have him baptize your baby marry your daughter or bury your mother looking back he sees his first funeral as an important milestone in the year in this day of constant agitation and hypersensitivity to questions of race some people expect fireworks every time a white man and negro get together in the same room this may be true when you are talking about angry mobs but when the equation is reduced to two individuals the battle shifts back to their minds where it is won or lost on merit not blinding prejudice his words come after a year when he has won many such parlor battles as mr johnson predicted both he and pueblo gardens have drawn enthusiastic support from the cynics and scoffers who no longer respect a church that does not deal with life and wrestle with the issues of the market place his popularity sprang quickest from young people since his arrival a large number of college students from the nearby university of arizona have bolstered the list of regular worshipers though many of the churchs older members were slower to accept their new minister others were willing to meet him more than halfway despite special hardships one woman crippled and living out her final days in a small rest home happily welcomes his weekly visits but once he leaves she becomes the butt of sneers and gossip i am proud to shake his hand every sunday and to welcome him into my house declares a brave merchant who has been taunted kidded is the word he usesby several customers but i just let them talk he says stoically and i havent lost very many of them in tucson as in four previous assignments mr johnsons ministry is shared by his family often mrs johnson appears with her husband on hospital visits and house calls she is active in womens auxiliary work sings in the choir teaches sunday school and coaches the junior choir the couples two daughters gayle  and karen  adapted to their new environment and made friends quickly they too play an active role in the church and it is partly for their sake that mr johnson hopes for a long stay in tucson the whole family is fond of the wonderful friends we have made in tucson said mrs johnson after the first year but we would still be outsiders if we had just stayed in the parsonage and come out only once a week for sunday service the darkskinned minister adds sitting in his office one thinks back to missionaries trudging through black africa with a cargo of christianity now the faith of christ also comes in a brown earthen vessel he announces all of christendom finds itself embarrassed by the fact that it has been preaching for many many years the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man but now the churches find themselves lagging behind social and civic institutions in practicing the concept of equality for all men the danger to the christian church today is that it may be passed by the rest of the world we cannot continue to exist as a fancy little social club the negro is knocking and he is coming in he can come in lovingly or he can come in violently but he is coming in there are too many of us to be hanged burned or shot sometimes when he talks mr johnson sounds like a man who has known hate and violence all his life but he has not his early life in pasadena was almost devoid of racial strife the pain of his upbringing was inflicted not by brickbats but by a teenage bout with polio that left his legs weak and skinny providence is the word used by the minister to explain his life probably i would never be able to be here today if i had been raised in mississippi i am too much a fighter he declares surveying history mr johnson points out that the sidebyside relationship between negroes and whites has always been an intimate one we have fought beside you and you have made our women sleep beside you now all we ask is the right to sit beside you in a restaurant or on a bus and to share your voting booth 
lion of malawi
	the great ngwazi pmmr i kamuzu the lion of jbwlimalawi on july  he ¦ b jrfeljre came into his own as  prime minister of the independent state of malawi known for the last seventy years or so as the british protectorate of nyasaland he is dr banda one of africas best known personalities widely revered for his courageous and successful battle against the now dead central african federation and sir roy welensky he was born in  of peasant parents in the kasungu district of nyasaland fifteen years after the establishment of the british protectorate there his parents called him kamuzu meaning little root because his mothers barrenness was ended by a root given her by a medicine man he was educated at the livingstonia mission of the church of scotland and adopted the name hastings after a missionary he admired in  he set out to walk to south africa with typical nyasa zeal for betterment he travelled  miles for nearly a year through bush country in search of better educational opportunities he worked for eight years on the rand goldfields and studied at night schools after hearing a lecture by dr aggrey the famous viceprincipal of achimota in the gold coast the man who also inspired nkrumah he decided in  to travel to the united states for the next fifteen years the tough struggle to educate himself continued he went to high school took a degree as bachelor of philosophy at chicago university and qualified as a doctor at meharry medical college in nashville tennessee he helped pay for his schooling by working as a sunday school teacher during a recent visit to the us someone who was with him at chicago found a picture of the young banda in a college photograph a remarkably handsome man sporting a straw boater and sent it to him he went on to britain in  and in  took his lrcp in edinburgh to enable him to practice in british territories as a doctor this was the time when he became an elder of the church of scotland the next few years he practiced in london but he was also at the centre of the struggle for african self determination and his surgery at aylestone avenue kilburn not far from the west african stu dents union hostel in maida vale became a place of pilgrimage for all nationalists it was here that he formed his close association with kwame nkrumah and it was from here that he led the campaign against the central african federation after he had learnt from his close correspondence with his people of the deep opposition to the federation when it was proposed in  in  federation was finally forced through although in the summer of  nyasa opposition had found militant expression but after federation was a reality the opposition collapsed dr banda decided to remain away from his people until there seemed a real chance of victory he continued work for a while longer among his  white patients in kilburn one woman spoke of him thus that wonderful doctor with so many patients for years he tended everyones troubles we knew then he was a great man and then in  he moved to ghana he set up practice in kumasi and abjured politics events in ghana between  and  cannot have escaped his attention however not only was there the rapid move towards independence but he must also have witnessed the worst period of political violence in ashanti his ties with ghana already strong were firmly cemented during this period in  there was increased pressure for him to return from many quarters in nyasaland henry chipembere now a minister wrote that the country needed a kind of saviour  a man of about fifty or sixty an intellectual with a character combining nationalism with honesty self denial and a spirit of cooperativeness and in the spring of  he returned to london his mind made up it was one of the most sensational homecomings of modem times as far back as  he was thought of as the great leader and when he actually materialized the excitement was tremendous this was the miscalculation of the british about banda they believed that because he had been abroad for so long he was out of touch and would have no popular support after all he could not even speak the language he had to address crowds in english but his absence had made him into a messiah so when he did return and discovered a taste for oratory and the knowledge that the people were behind him the initiative was all his although at first thought of as a moderate the feeling he stirred in nyasaland against the stupid federation particularly after he had returned to ghana for the allafrican peoples congress of december  was bound to lead him to a direct clash with the colonial administration and the federal authorities which came in the state of emergency of march  when he and many others were detained the massacre plot he had allegedly planned was convincingly disposed of by mr justice devlins report of later that year it was this plus the way banda had shown the unmistakable opposition of nyasas to federation that persuaded the macmillan government that the federation would have to end this more than anything else will ensure for banda african immortality the man called in to break the federation was significantly a scot iain macleod who still retains the close links he established then with banda the rest of the story is well known the release from prison the successive constitutional conferences the overwhelming victories in elections with his success in the battle against federation some thought dr banda mellowed but in fact he had always been a warm generous personality he was never as some of his enemies tried to make out a racialist his many years abroad showed that it was only the federation that roused his ire that presented the man with a challenge his present policy is to keep as many europeans as he can because malawi needs them even at the risk of offending some of his own party and as with kenyatta malawis europeans have mostly accepted bandas good intentions although some hostile propaganda mostly emanating from salisbury has tried to make out that all is not well in malawi the remarkable solidarity of all his people behind banda has made this one of the most stable of african states tribalism virtually does not exist they think of themselves as nyasas or rather now malawis he is free from ostentation and neither smokes nor drinks he had already ordered cuts in ministers salaries including his own even before independence autocratic he undoubtedly is with a will of his own and strong dislikes notably journalists and sir roy welensky but he is also a realist and quite prepared to sign a trade agreement with southern rhodesia because malawi exports labour and maintain close links with the portuguese because malawi depends economically on the beira railway if it is in the interest of malawi ill even have the devil as an ally this then is a remarkable new phenomenon on the african scene of all malawis and their traditional wanderlust has taken them to many parts of africa the most famous is also the one who will spring the most surprises  from west africa
usually as a sequel to the eternal question what do you think of this country negro americans are wont to ask the african what do you think about us those who have already been misinformed about the answer to the latter question will usually say i have been told or i understand that you people do not like us »u the reply that the african makes to such a comment varies with the particular african the nature and extent of his previous association with negro americans his experience or inexperience in dealing with such questions and the relative formality or informality of the occasion on which he is called upon to make a statement whatever the situation and whatever the nature of the answer he strives to give he is heard with the utmost attention it is usual for part of his audience to be disillusioned by the explanations offered the rest may shake their heads in disbelief and go away with their misconceptions all the more fortified the number of times many friends of mine and i personally have encountered this question is simply alarming people are forever asking is it true that you people do not like us in homes at parties making speeches to colored groups and every time we meet people for the first time it is bound to come up negro americans are very anxious to know what africans think about them they would like to know how closely akin to them the africans feel they like to be reassured that africans sympathize with them in the social injustices they suffer most unfortunately however many of them have already reached the conclusion that africans in this country want to have nothing to do with them this is a most regrettable misunderstanding and it is often discussed by africans and negro americans among themselves and whenever the two groups meet it is my opinion that the issue which could easily have been disregarded as insignificant has grown to serious proportions by being discussed a little too frequently with hardly any attempt by either side to understand or tolerate the position of the other discussions which should aim at ironing out the differences often degenerate into sessions of recrimination and counterrecrimination perhaps the greatest fault of which either side is equally guilty is a tendency to treat isolated incidents as empirical evidence leading  up to a generalized conclusion such extrapolations or projections are usually unjustifiable and misguided an unfriendly encounter between a particular african and a particular negro american is not considered simply as a case of two individuals failing to get along but must be misconstrued as proof of the fact that africans and negro americans do not get along in general after such an encounter the african goes home and tells his friends the negro goes home and tells his friends and theres one more evidence that further strengthens the misconception what we are all apt to forget is that people are people and as such will always have their differences africans differ among themselves so do negro americans even twins have their differences physical mental and emotional when a negro american asks an african if they are the same and the african says no he only means that he is an african and the negro is an american when africans refuse to be referred to as negroes they mean no offense to the negro american they are not trying to disown him they just want to dissociate themselves from the derogatory undertones of the word negro so whereas negritude is a bond binding all of us together and should therefore foster good relations it is at the same time too much to expect that just because negroes and africans have a common distant ancestry every african and every negro american should get along always and everywhere this isnt the case and will never be my intention in this article is not to traffic in the controversy but help bring it to a conclusion i hold no brief for either side though i have to admit that as an african i may not be able to divest myself completely of all of my own personal or national biases it is only fair to state that there have been faults on both sides and there have been areas of great misunderstanding where we have not taken time out to appreciate or tolerate the position of the other side africa is a huge continent so huge in fact that most people do not realize that the congo though one of the larger of the fiftysix countries that make up africa is about onethird the size of the united states africas two hundred million people though they have the common inheritance of being more or less dark vary considerably in culture traditions social outlook and the extent to which they have been affected by the colonial domination of europe nor can negro americans be placed all in one class the varying tinge of dark color in every one of them is not enough to nullify the differences in background social status parental upbringing and so on first let us consider the african in all probability he is a student in his early twenties his financial situation varies he is not the son of a tribal chief or a village head as the popular misconception goes but one can say that in the african context his means and accomplishments are above average some africans are urbane and sophisticated others may be quite rustic this varies with their countries and their background but they have all been schooled in the rigid and petty formalities and social conventions of europe and while being african their manners may bear the trade mark made in great britain or made in france thus they may be seeped in class consciousness intellectual snobbery apt to despise or sneer at whatever they consider downgraded they know who should not say what to them are not prone to be casual but are rather selective in making friends the differences cited above are not offensive per se what very frequently gives offense is the fact that some africans may be unduly supercilious or overbearing in attitude their peculiar flair for being prim and proper all the time is often irksome their airs of superiority make people want to cut them down to size they often strut around giving the impression impression of much travelled and widely read in the wrong places these are of course faults some africans mistakenly use the norms to which they are accustomed as yard sticks against which social practices here must be judged this is topsyturvy many africans refuse to adapt and persist in what may be considered outlandish behavior from the american point of view for example they wont do uncle willie or the monkey and keep talking of such things as the waltz and the quickstep eccentricities turn them into squares it is needless to say that the african student does not regard himself as a square he may not be hip according to the standards of those around him but his selfesteem is overriding he has no desire to compromise on his attitudes or what he believes is proper a certain class of negro americans fondly refer to themselves as bad or as tough cats in truth the african despises the average tough cat they consider his type of sophistication cheap and secondgrade to a more genteel and suave type of sophistication on account of these rivalries many young negro americans dislike the african they accuse him of trying to act cute or to act like white people the african on his part remains despising snobbish standoffish unwilling to become hip or to identify with this particular group i remember on one occasion a fellow student said to me why dont you take off those sillylooking things and get dressed he was speaking of my agbada he drove me to the brink of madness if you africans think you are so cool why didnt you stay over there why did you come here i have heard people say again and again some negro americans go to the extent of establishing an analogy between  our relations and those of the twelve sons of jacob in the bible in any case one thing is sure before he or she comes here the african is eagerly looking forward to meeting the negro american in fact that for him is one of the major differences between studying in europe and studying in america but as the saying goes to travel hopefully is sometimes better than to arrive in seeking directions on a busy new york or chicago street the lost african naturally finds identity in the negro and is instinctively inclined to ask him for directions this may not always be the best thing to do he may receive the first jolt of disillusionment later on during his stay in this country he may discover some of the lower classes of negro americans at what he may consider downgraded behavior things like making a nuisance of oneself making noise or drawing unnecessary attention to oneself for the african this is a serious factor he suffers a let down on the long run he may be forced to the conclusion that such niggerly behavior is part of the reason why some white americans despise negro americans the thought fills him with disappointment and resentment there is an old african saying that he who befriends a chicken smells of fowls dung therefore the african student may start to dissociate from this class of negro american and find another identity for him self i have some personal experience in this field in birmingham alabama last summer while trying to be friendly to two negro boys i was robbed of  at home in nigeria i wouldnt have been found so close to such boys as to let them get my money in the short scuffle that followed the police arrived and i was arrested for affray and disorderly conduct and spent the night in jail while generalizations are dangerously misleading one can still say with a fair amount of certainty that it is the lower or middle class negro that is apt to dislike the african or think that the african dislikes him he belongs to a subculture into which he has been forced by this inequities of american society in his group and among his own he is tops an established or aspiring tough cat and he conforms strictly to the edicts of his group wherein lies his dignity pride and self esteem he too is guilty of expecting everybody including the african to conform to the norms of his own subculture one of the first impressions i got after i arrived in this country three years ago is that many young negro americans have an inferiority complex about their color they owe nothing to it except the social injustices and discrimination they suffer they just want to be americans and it looks like the africans here remind them of something they would rather forget i am not exactly sure to what extent this inferiority complex is true but suffice it to say that it does exist one other factor in the misunderstanding is that africans and negroes are not always partners in suffering discrimination at least in northern us the african is apparently better received than the native negro american his airs of selfassurance good manners his robes and his farfetched accent very often unlock doors which may be explicitly or tacitly barred to negroes the reason for this is that all americans are anxious to show every visitor the goodness that is in their country they want the visitor to carry away nothing but the best impressions for this reason and because africa is playing an ever increasing role in the cold war white americans are more prone to accept the african before the negro american this is the irony of american life a negro once asked me do you think that the white family with whom you are staying would play host to a negro boy from say mississippi this was a question i was afraid to answer at that particular time though i wouldnt be now not at least in the case of this particular family on account of his socalled acceptance by the whites the african may be suspect or disliked by the negroes by his association with the whites he appears like a deserter of the negro cause who has abrogated his kin in preference for their persecutors a common misconception is that whites usually tell africans not to have anything to do with negroes they are unjustly accused of telling the african that he is not the same as the negro and must keep away from him this is as false as it is unfair in my opinion any white who is willing to entertain an african in his home could hardly be accused of negrophobia there is of course the story told of an african who sat beside a white couple in church the couple got up and moved to another pew after the service they came to the boy to apologize they had discovered that he was an african they even invited him to dinner in their home such is the irony of life in america in any case it is only fair to say that many wellmeaning white amercans find it easier to make their break with the african who is a foreigner and therefore bears no personal grudges against them once in a while one may meet an african who has been overwhelmed or taken in by the immensity of the cordiality extended to him by whites such an african may falsely reason that if whites are willing to extend to him such fair treatment when he the african is the epitome of blackness and negritude the negro must be to blame for the discrimination he suffers such africans are very few and will probably be found among the new arrivals most africans realize that the problem is deeper than that  from the explanations offered it is obvious that in some instances the african has failed the negro while in others the negro has failed the african visiting africans can perhaps afford to be a little less condescending in attitude they could try to be a little less censorious of the negro but rather strive to understand him and his unfortunate social position in america on the other hand negroes should seek to know the african better while i have met or heard of some negroes whose knowledge of african history and current african politics would put me to shame i still maintain that such negroes are few most negroes know very little about africa except for a few impressions picked up from tarzan movies perhaps in the past the negro has had no reason to want to know about africa but the past is now past perhaps they were afraid of being disappointed at what they might find out in conclusion i would like to say that the biggest problems are a mutual ignorance of the others viewpoint and a lack of adequate communication it would be nice also to remind negro americans that africans of this generation are proud and selfassertive proud of themselves their continent their culture and their inheritance any negro who is explicitly or implicitly ashamed of our culture or considers his or her negritude a bane rather than a boon is hardly worthy of our friendship
the audience is subtly invaded from the moment the curtainless play begins the spirituals pull you into the church where you become a part of sister margarets sermon against sin the invasion grows in intensity becoming less subtle as the characters peel off layers of protec tive covering to finally expose their pitiful nakedness you are carried along to this precipice you too are unclothed the play which packs this tremendous wallop is the amen corner by james baldwin produced and directed by frank silvera veteran actor of  years on the stage and screen the play opened last march at a miniature workshop theatre in los angeles the robertson playhouse and was the vehicle silvera used to introduce his theatre of being a new concept of acting amen was an instantaneous success life termed it important   a smash hit margaret harford in the los angeles times noted that amen corner is a play with no chip on the shoulder but rather a searing ache in the heart no boiling bitterness only the devastating despair and loneliness of people who have mismanaged their lives john g houser in the los angeles heraldexaminer felt that the play will mark baldwin not only as the top negro dramatist of our time but as one of our finest ranking with tennessee williams and arthur miller international fame too has come to baldwins first drama written in  produced unspectacularly at howard university then buried in a trunk until silvera resurrected it a men has been invited to represent the united states at the vienna festival next summer sharing honors with the moiseyev ballet from russia the comedie frangais from france and the royal ballet from englandan unprecedented honor for a little theatre production after playing to delighted audiences for seven months in los angeles silvera took his cast to san francisco in september for a limited run before opening in new york in november     the play revolves around sister margaret minister of a small storefront church in harlem brilliantly played by actress bea richards sister margaret left her husband ten years before the play opens and s obsessed with keeping her  yearold son david the church pianist from reentering the world which to her is synonomous with sin margarets destitute musician husband luke reappears dying from tuberculosis determined that david shall have a chance to live his own life luke tells his wife i wont let you make david safe david wants to play jazz like his father but feels guilty about deserting his mother and the church in the meantime the congregation has decided that since margarets husband is upstairs dying in his sins and her son is fornicating in the wilderness she is no longer a shining example to guide them into heaven they set about to snatch the church from her beneath the surface of the story is the desperation of the negro who is born into a world of confusion and chaos luke tries desperately to maintain his dignity and man hood in a society which seems dedicated to his psychological castration david is symbolic of a multitude of negro youths who are raised in a matriarchy which subconsciously tends to channel active masculinity into feminine passivity margaret of course is trying to escape the agonies of living through religion she inoculate herself with the holy ghost not in order to expand her awareness but to quarantine herself from the outside world she forgot that jesus whom she calls upon so frequently said i have to die so that you may have life and have it more abundantly she accepts instead the moral ethics of the puritans who confused sex with sin renounced joy and glorified suffering to expiate guilt margaret tells luke that their sin was that they were too happy when their second child is born dead she feels this is punishment for their happiness luke asks her what did we ever do to be punished except be born poor but in her sorrow margaret rejects her husband and seeks solace in the lord i had to find me a hiding place she said luke bitterly resists accepting the church as a substitute for life when margaret wrestles with him on his deathbed to give his soul to god he tells her i aint gonna come crawlin to the lord now making out id do better if i had it all to do over  aint gonna go out screaming against hellfire it would make me nothing but a dirty drunken man didnt do nothing but blow music and chase women all his life i aint gonna let it be like that you know that aint all there was to it luke dies and david leaves home to join a jazz band life has thrust itself in again upon sister margaret in her loss she wails with dawning terror somewhere i must have done something wrong this confession assaults the audience like an admission of its own guilt thinking of her misdirected love  for the lord margaret tells her sister maybe luke needed it more maybe david could have used it better in the end the trinity is complete her son and her husband are gone and she is dethroned from the ministry but with the loss of the church margaret finally discovers what it means to love the lord it aint in all the singin and shoutin she tells her faithless congregation it aint in the reading of the bible it aint even in running all over everybody trying to get to heaven to love the lord is to love all his children all of them everyone to suffer with them and rejoice with them and never count the cost v   baldwin explains that the price sister margaret pays for running from life to religion is the loss of her individuality she has to lock her femininity up in a closet in order to protect her son it is easier for a woman to embrace religion as an escape mechanism because she is passive by nature baldwin states but to escape from a society which constantly menaces him a man demands more action than the passivity of a church unable to retaliate against the threatening society the man vents his rage and frustration on himself in selfloathing and upon other members of his race in the seemingly senseless saturday night violence and when we stop hating ourselves baldwin added we can swing too far in the other direction we can experience an excess of bitterness for society but excesses can be corrected this is better than calling ourselves a zero and having nothing to begin with unwinding backstage after one of her emotionally shattering performances as sister margaret bea richards a slender dark woman whom one critic called pure africa confessed after my first rehearsal i cried really i was frightened i wanted to pack my bags and run back to new york silvera kept insisting that i go down into myself back to those hidden areas which i had forgotten existed or ever were but i didnt want to go back those areas were too painful that was why i left there in the first place then when i said that line somewhere i must have done something wrongsuddenly i was transported back to africa somewhere lord between here and there i had done something wrong it was like peeling off layer after layer of myself it was the most excruciating human emotion i have ever felt i had gone back into the beginning of my being and i was frightened yes i leaped  years right back to africa its unbelievable what a tremendous loss our people have sustained it was so strange but i knew that this was the me i was forced by society to bury it is somethting to peel off all those layers she concluded    vj  and how does director frank silvera accomplish sending his actors back to their source he does it by speaking to them in his barely audible ponderous voice about his concept of the theatre of being for the past  years silvera has played more caucasian mexican and indian roles on the stage and in the movies than he has negro parts last year he was nominated best actor of the year on broadway for his role in the lady of the camellias he created the role of john pope sr in a hatful of rain in which anthony franciosa and ben gazzara played his sons he directed and starred in the players ring production of arthur millers view from the bridge a member of new yorks famed actors studio he conducts an actors workshop in los angeles and previously directed one in new york silvera explains that the negro has long been denied his being he has not seen his image not on the stage not in movies not on television so he has been acting as if he were not in the picture but being cannot forever be suppressed what you are seeing is the negros bursting forth into being he is finding his image and showing it to the world and to himself this play goes beyond the stanislavsky method of illusion which portrays characters as if they existed amen is a play about a group of negroes not as they are thought to be like not as they would like to become but as they now are this is the essence of the theatre of being these characters are not as if we bes silvera who turned down a starring role in the hit play the deputy in order to direct amen continues bea says in the play somewhere i must have done something wrong in those words there is remorse and grief i tell her to be grief where does grief live where was this grief born after she did the scene a few times i told her no thats not where it is go deeper you know where that moment is you know where the pain the grief the guilt is go back further inside yourself and find it its all there it was born in africa it was born when you sold your mother into slavery now when she says itsomewhere i must have done something wrongi hurt inside the audience hurts because she takes us right into the experience with her she is being the remorse the grief the guilt the play is shattering silvera says because it allows a being to be hollywood and television are theatres of nonbeings for  years ive played a mexican general a beverly hills banker a french gentleman but ive never been allowed to play a negro i dont mean a stereotype a pitiable person afflicted with color i mean a real man being is what the negro has been denied vrc  ¦ the cast of amen are all members of silveras workshop and they all bes bob decoy turns in a sensitive portrayal as luke the dying horn player equally as effective and moving is john perrow as  the guiltridden son a fine lusty performance is delivered by academy award nominee juanita moore almost stealing the show is isabelle sanford as the hyprocritical spinster whom no man has ever touched thank you jesus whitman maoy is also an accomplished scene stealer as a church elder veteran stage actress maidie norman is regal as margarets loyal sister and josie dotson evokes pathos as a young mother who cant understand why god in order to make her bow her head has put two of her babies in the graveyard all of this is spiced with fine musical direction by frank wilson and a compact efficient set designed with brilliance by vantile whitfield but it is bea richards as sister margaret who receives glorious hosannas from each and every critic a theatregoer paid her the supreme compliment when he said in the beginning shes just a plain black woman but in the end shes beautiful beautiful amen is not a satire on religion it exposes the falsity and subsequent penalty for confusing shallow amens based on fear with spiritual understanding based on true brotherhood as one character said if you dont love your brother who you can see how you gonna love god who you aint seen the church figures prominently in baldwins writings he admits now in retrospect that david represents him baldwin a minister at  quit the church at seventeen and then left home he explains he entered the church in the hope it would make his preacher father love him but it didnt work out that way he says perhaps the universality of the amen corner which appeals to negro and white audiences alike can best be explained by the universality of its author what i have to understand baldwin says what we all must understand is that the facts of life are the same for everyone but the details are different we get all hung up in the details what we have to know about another person is that he suffers the same as we do
of shakespeare james baldwin recently observed   he saw as i think we should that the people who produce the poet are not responsible to him he is responsible to them that is why he is called a poet the remark was included in an article for the london observer in which the american author expressed deep regret at the traditional and stylish exodus of us writers to europe the writer as baldwin sees him is far too dependent on his environment where he was born grew up the language that he speaks to expect of the continentor any foreign retreatany magic solution to his ageold fight with society quite the contrary the really serious writer who would create as well as criticize who would exult in life as well as analyze can expect only barrenness and frustration in an alien climateone for which he has neither understanding nor feeling  the point as regards shakespeare at least is well taken the eminent bard was anything but removed from his time its daytoday trivia its often absurd institutions and what a time elizabethan england producer of shakespeare bacon marlowe and jonson nevertheless has to go down in the books as among the crudest most banal epochs in western development yet here is shakespeare as businessman as landowner as amiable country squire contentedly going his way among the simple townsmen the farmers the merchants here is the father of hamlet and julius caesar partaking of pleasures cultivating friendships worthy of any innkeeperor as a modern counterpart any rotarian that he was able to bridge the gap however between art and as it were antiart has to attest solely to some fortunate and rare facet of shakespeares own individual temperament it cannot i think be used as an explanation or a condition of what he achieved as a poet to accept that proposition would be to deny the tragic example of countless wouldbe innovators through time immemorial who lacking shakespeares wellroundedness and toughness have fallen mournful victims to adverse and limited social climatesclimates that treated with neglect and stupidity their fledgling efforts at expression to accept that proposition would be to overlook the many sad casualties even today who despairing of contact of communication of comprehension even have sacked the contemplative role for some feebler more socially defined calling for indeed society is responsible to the poetin a way that only the most developed and sophisticated civilizations have ever understood and accepted why one has only to note the example of france the last three centuries or so an environment that has nurtured a vastly inordinate flowering of art and ideas including baldwins own within its studios and cafes and missionlike salons on the other side of the coin it is invariably america that is singled out as derelict america as every college sophomore knows is the actual epitome of societys neglect of the poet terms like wasteland babbittry and mammon have become almost synonymous with this muchlampooned land of the brave the truth is that the nation as a whole has matured considerably over the last several decadesin this one respect at least not so however with that distinct subculture referred to as negro america it is in fact perhaps fair to say that among negro americans taken as a society the twentieth centurythat weird exciting twentieth century of books and expresseshas not yet arrived that we are right now going through a cultural stage experienced by mainstream america more than half a century agoa stage characterized notably by mental dullness stolidity and prudishness now the word prudish would on the face of it seem the last to seriously describe the american negrothat bigcity epicurean that thoroughly emancipated bon vivant that hipster but i refer to intellectual prudishness which really has little to do with jazz and lovemaking the latter being furthermore a talent usually projected onto the hipster for people react to appearances i refer to prudishness of the mind of the intellectual faculties and its ultimate horrible result the death of the spirit a long time ago the novelist william faulkner in a somewhat fuzzy defense of the plantation cautioned southern negroes to beware of that twentieth century north the warning went unheeded as well it should have but in entering the twentieth century the negro has as faulkner perhaps guessed been cheated that is he has shared or been allowed to share only that which is absurd in its societythe automobile the televisionand has remained totally untouched by that societys one redeeming virtue a growing if belated exploration of the world of ideas for what actually are the values of current negro americana what does it hold important significant imitable well very much like the white mans puritan grandfather todays negro american and i speak of him as an entity which class notwithstanding he ultimately is places a grossly exaggerated premium on visible achievement among negroes it is generally that constituent who commands power or owns property or is conspicuously up and doing who takes the prize intellectually it is he who is most accommodating who operates on planes that are familiar to the crowdreinforcing its foolish doctrines rationalizing its preposterous mythswho is said to have contributed in short it is that constituent who fits into one of the neat categories the society of puritans has designed for itself and puritanlike defies contradiction who enjoys respect that luckless sinner who does not fit and who is hence unable as it were to render a reasonable justification for his existenceis either dismissed as different that final coup de grace or viewed with actual hostility these are to be sure quite universal conditions at work anywhere and anytime there is a newly emerging or in our case retarded social order even europe that quite definitive culture had its burghers but with us the lag is particularly lamentable living as we do among all the vestments of culture anthropology excuses any retardation in the event of isolation wanting of contact anthropology cannot answer for the american negro sociology perhaps can but that for later all this adds up to nothing short of tragedy in the classic sense of the term for it is blind unconscious and therefore needless even at the best of times in the best of climates the writers role is a staggering one not only must his craft be mastered he must somehow manage to relate his often unique mental and emotional experiences to audiences who normally couldnt care less this sounds despairing but it isnt really assuredly the marriagethe true marriagebetween writer and reader is a rare incident indeed as writers anywhere can testify but the marriage can take place what is needed is a socially recognized common ground a mutual frame of reference an identifiable and stylish language of dialogue in contemporary negro america however there exists absolutely no such language this dearth pervades the entire subculture as true of the college campus as the backwaters of the society i can recall the frustration of a prominent negro novelist as he recounted a conversation with a professor of english at a small southern college she didnt know who sartre was he plainted had never heard of him to that experience i can personally add a wealth and not all on the campuses the endless taverns for example that dot a city like chicago yield little in the way of dialogue that would stimulate even the dimmest imagination let alone ever nurture a samuel johnson for interchange is a most precious thing to the contemplative role that priceless giveand take of ideas of emotional experience so characteristic of continental creative life in the black mammon it is simply not to be attained is not to be approached my novelist friend and others like him too often are forced to fleefor contact for sustenanceto that very white community they so often attack and upbraid this is sad but necessary for that writer is rare indeed who can claim a really meaningful relationship in the american negro community who is judged and reacted to on terms that are important to him he is indeed rare who can communicate in those ecstatic electrified moments when communication is so desiredon planes that are anything but travesties on real selfexpression the sad truth is that that world in which he livesand on which he feeds for his very life is a foreign country to his community the plight of the writerthe negro writeris really a kind of paradox a riddle a joke there on the one hand is his audience that is there is the white man for negroes we have established do not read this one consideration is challenging enough for that audience is to say the least a most peculiar onerather like some rare and freak animal say with five extremely developed senses but totally lacking in the sixth that sixthby far the most important and certainly the most dangerous to be withoutis his perception of reality that is his humble acceptance of his own like our own rather inglorious condition in this universeacceptance of his equal stratification among other races of the world it is that very sixth sense that terrifying blind spot that the negro  writer has the sheer responsibility to instill yes responsibilityfor the socalled white truthsayers giants like faulkner hemingway fitzgerald and mercy wolfe while they lived betrayed a most cowardly inability to broach the problem were themselves in fact every bit as deluded as those whom they would awaken and improve this task in itself at times seems hopeless and passages of dialogue from chester himes and john a williams are jolting reminders often exasperating often pathetic of the white mans unacknowledged but really urgent sickness yet as though this were not of itself formidable enough were not breathtaking and often cowing in its immensity there is the added matter of the negronot the writer but the reader or nonreader or antireader it is he after all to whom the warrior would repair at the height of the battlefor reassurance for understanding the irony is that the understanding indeed exists as the briefest remarks with any wino will suggestbut only suggest for language is lacking it is he who understands as the white reader does not that ours is not a very optimistic world and most importantly it is he for whom the writer would create weary of barren polemics or of perpetually refuting an obvious lie and desperately needing to return to art and herein lay the paradox for it is with him in his company that the writer finds himself immersed in a world more alien to his own than all the regions of the universe not even the most successful writers are totally excepted here not even those giants who apparently would enjoy great empathy that is reciprocal empathy with their brethren often among other negroes the established writer finds himself being assessed on planes very different from those of his major contribution it is often interesting in discussing say a writer like baldwin to discover that it is primarily to his role as champion of civil_rights that he owes his notoriety among negroes lost is the artist here that strange phenomenon who probably will share rank with camus lost completely the deeper manambiguous definitionlessfrom whom the real art which is actually thoroughly without cause has sprung as for other of the contemporary authors williams ralph ellison john o killens le roi jonesthey are virtually unknown and certainly unread among literate negroes gwendolyn brooks that poet so recognized among the white literati is often toasted by negroes but seldom discussed much of this complaint may seem unrealisticas it were asking too much assuredly there is scarcely one facet of the negro personality which does not have sound historical explanationsexplanations that reflect less on the race itself than the peculiar often surreal history that has produced it our art has been the art of anguish the blues the prayer ideas seldom flourish in shantytown when a negro professor of english values her automobile her wardrobe her social engagements above her library there is a kind of sadness there but also an explanation when negro college students are taught by precept and example that to wear the right clothes and join the right fraternities are ends more desirable than mastering kant and dostoievsky there is a kind of grim irony justified only by the realization often difficult that here after all is a race that did not create itself for what are we really but a tribe of eunuchs who have mystically come very near to being what the whites in fact believe us to be inhumanwho have lost that most essential possession of any tribe any human uncompromising belief in our own worth this has everything to do with the emphasis often grotesque which we place on things this has everything to do with our denial of all that is intangible in this worlddenial of art discussion thoughtdenial of those very things that redeem a civilization a society of its intrinsic absurdity this has everything to do finally with our assumption very smug and very puritan that we have sufficiently explored this universe of ours and have defined it for the universe is limitless and he who would explore it who would chart new courses among its constellations is the writer the poetunfettered by intellectual restrictions spiritual bounds moral considerationnourished and not stifled by his society and whatever the negro writer has to contribute however personal or abstract his approach he needs his own environmenthis daytoday contact and involvementto lend it substance and art he need not be estranged from his roots and most often does not want to be few writers start out for the ivory tower they are generally forced that wayby a blind indifferent social climate that frustrates and injures often unawares as the nation at large matures is more receptive to the contemplative role negro america has remained a straggler in this importantthis essentialregard and the current negro writer who does not have an unshakable faith in himself is frustrated indeed in looking about him for justification of himself of his chosen function this is not a plea for special consideration for the writer though i personally rate that member who is able to interpret his society to sing of it among that societys most valuable constituents it is simply to seek for him a clearly defined place in the social order and hopefully some semblance of empathy with it this calls for a thorough reevaluation of the lowly place to which we have assigned the entire realm of creativity and thought it calls for energy and imagination it calls for adventure 
foretaste of paradise a blue haze descended at night and with it strings of fairy lights on the broad avenues from the window of a small room in an apartment on fifth avenue and th street i looked over the rooftops of negrodom and tried to believe my eyes what a city what a world and what a year for a colored boy to be leaving home for the first time twentyone sixteen months out of college full of golden hopes and romantic dreams i had come all the way from los angeles to find the job i wanted to hear the music of my taste to see serious plays and god willing to become a writer it did not take long to discover that i was just one of many young negroes arriving in harlem for the first time and with many of the same thoughts and intentions within a year or two we began to recognize ourselves as a group and to become a little selfconscious about our significance when we were not too busy having fun we were shown off and exhibited and presented in scores of places to all kinds of people and we heard the sighs of wonder amazement and sometimes admiration when it was whispered or announced that here was one of the new negroes nothing could have been sweeter to young people who only a few weeks or months earlier had been regarded as anything but remarkable in topeka and cleveland and eatonville and salt lake city young people who more often than otherwise had seemed a trifle richard wright  whacky to the home folks in harlem we were seen in a beautiful light we were heralds of a dawning day we were the firstborn of the dark renaissance we were not just struggling artists trying to find ourselves no there was something special about being young and a poet in harlem in the middle twenties we couldnt quite explain it but one of our advocates on park avenue made an interesting suggestion primitive man she said had contacts with the infinite which civilization has broken primitive man was sharper more acute in his intuition relying always on logic and reason civilized man has lost the one thing most essential in america the indian and the negro are nearer to the unspoiled primitive than are other people the indians spirit is crushed the negrowell see for yourself up and down the streets of harlem untamed youngsters were doing a wild dance called the charleston they were flitting over the sidewalks like mad while their companions squatting nearby beat out tomtom rhythms on kitchenware the unsuspecting stranger who paused to observe the performance was in danger of being surrounded shoved into their circle and compelled to attempt a camel walk at parties in ballrooms and on neighboring stages the older people proved that age or lack of it had nothing to do with this joy this abandon this    primitivism they proved it too at houserent parties where they drank bathtub gin ate pigs knuckles and danced with the lights off darkness brings the jungle to our room    darkness hangs our room with pendulums of vine  the link with the jungle was obvious in the little housefront churches there was swaying and moaning and shouting wasnt that proof on a voodoo island such behavior would be called possession would it be any more real or complete than this no the american negro our friend insisted was not quite civilizedfortunately in his play and in his worship his wildness was still apparent in his work and his art it had almost disappeared the new negro was to recapture this definite though sometimes dim quality in poetry painting and song by this means he must transmit it to all america through us no less america would regain a certain value that civilization had destroyed the idea intoxicated us we went to work zealously and some americans saw the things we did and the miracle of the whole notion was that it came so near taking root our group came within an inch of giving america if not as much as our friend from park avenue had hoped at least a certain new aesthetic value it came close to repeating in the united states say what the preraphaelite brotherhood had done in england two generations or so earlier the gusto and flavor of zora neale hurstons storytelling for example long before the yarns were published in mules and men and other books became a local legend which might easily have spread further under different con ditions a tiny shift in the center of gravity could have made the books bestsellers and it is easy to see how the startled surprise that greeted the poems of countee cullen and the wonderment that followed discovery of langston hughes completely effortless lyrics might have taken other directions and given the young poets an even wider vogue than they enjoyed at first the same or more could have happened to the stylized figures in aaron douglas drawings his bookjackets and illustrations were followed by household decorations furniture designs public murals these might have started a trend had they gone into other rooms different hotel lobbies more strategically situated university libraries even so the reception which the new negroes received was warmly gratifying never before in america never since and perhaps not for much time to come has it been or will it be possible for a negro poet to say with feeling speaking of harlem let us roam the night together singing in those days it was said and meant but there were moments when the new negroes betrayed a strange uneasiness of course none went so far as to suggest that there might be something wrong with harlem or that the romantic concept that our group had the link with the primitive the key to joy and intuitive understanding might be a little farfetchedbut now and then one of us would say a shocking thing almost beyond understanding then i remember for example hearing countee cullen say that he thought it fitting that a creative artist should die young he himself wanted all his work crowded into the next few years he wouldnt care to live a day beyond the age of forty langston hughes less inclined toward selfanalysis but sharper in his intuitions than most of the group sometimes imagined that he would have his fill much sooner be kind to me oh great dark city    i will not come to you again but whywhy this note in the music of the new negro something was wrong when the depression came and artists of every kind began to feel the pinch the harlem group was not excluded new negroes were scattered from boston to florida from pleasantville to carmelbythesea from alabama to the pearly gates a decade passed twelve years perhaps then some of us thought we could safely return to see what had happened to the city that had once filled us with song the harlem we found in  and  was another place one of the first things to shock us was the revelation that the people by whom harlem was favorably known did not live there any more paul robeson and marian anderson were less familiar figures in harlem in the early forties than were mrs roosevelt and mayor la guardia richard wright and countee cullen lived within shooting distance more or less but they were safely removed from the sounds of the streets it took an hours journey for either of them to see the rooftops of negrodom e simms campbell and w c handy lived on quiet hillsides surrounded by trees and lawns there was still a hill in harlem a fine proud one to be sure but it was not the same as theirs and the trees and lawns were not in peoples yards hazel scott and cab calloway and jimmie lunceford and the rest would certainly not have been moved by a poem which invited them to roam the night together in harlem they lived in westchester at least one reason for avoiding the harlem night streets in  would have been the fear of muggers where poets went about singing in the days of the new awakening angry frustrated boys now prowled where primitive children had danced on the sidewalks hungry evileyed little criminals lurked in doorways the rent party was a forgotten legend outlandish cults were meeting in some of the housefront churches where the moaning and shouting had formerly been spontaneous and filled with joy what in gods name had happened to me there seemed only one explanation no matter what else one might see there harlem remained what it had always been in essence a black ghetto and slum a clot in the american bloodstream and the fruit it was bearing was the fruit of the ghetto and the slum the fruit of compulsory group segregation based on race the children born there in the beautiful years of the middle twenties had grown up to be muggers and cultists when harlem rioted somewhat later a fuller answer emerged it is now known that a negro soldier was shot and wounded slightly when he attempted to take the part of a harlem poulet in an altercation with a white policeman in the lobby of a small hotel the soldiers mother happened to be nearby word of mouth reports of the incident were brief intense untrue a colored soldier had been shot and killed by white policemen in the presence of the soldiers mother at first it seemed that the mad rage which followed this incident in harlem was a protest and a reaction against the true reports of the kicking around sometimes the killing of colored soldiers in the south it suggested to me a story i had once planned to write about a gang of tough slumhardened black kids in chicago who hearing about a lynching in mississippi went out and overturned the fruit cart of an italian peddler and beat him up in a south side alley this early tendency to see the riot simply as an extension of the conflict in the south seemed good enough at first to me it seemed to sweep away the claim that the  south had a special right to deal with the problem of race relations in america as it sees fit irrespective of the interests of the nation as a wholeto maintain its caste mores as a leading editor asserted during world war ii in defiance if necessary of all the allied and axis armies it confirmed a belief which incidentally i still hold namely that the trouble with harlem is birmingham the trouble with los angeles is new orleans the trouble with illinois is mississippi the only flaw in that first impression as it related to harlem is that harlem did not riot against white people harlem rioted against harlem true it ravaged the shops and businesses of owners who get their living in harlem but do not live there likewise beyond dispute is the fact that the mob went for the symbols of exploitation and oppression but that was not its deepest impulse harlem was trying to commit suicide it was sick of muggers and cultists and zoot suits it was horrified and disgusted by the fruit of the beautiful years and in a moment of confusion and frustration it rioted against itself and tried to wipe the slate clean the young intellectuals who came to harlem in the middle twenties made a wonderful discovery they found that it is fun to be a negro under some conditions those who like myself had grown up in mixed or predominantly white communities even found that some segregation can be fun when its completely voluntary but the new negroes had lived long enough to learn that it is never fun to be alien it is neither pleasant nor wholesome to be deprived of the freedom of movement or of friendship or of participation in the essential life of ones country harlem must go the american bloodstream cannot manage hard clots of such size and density and all the other little harlems must change otherwise america will be balkanized into a nation of mutually incompatible minorities for the ideas and plans and the vigilance and distrust necessary to hem harlem in and to keep it there will create or maintain other harlems and all of them will not be black   
be towns only police l patrol car rolled slow§j ly through hedonsville  glowing coals of two cigarettes outlined the faces of the policemen inside two blocks down main street on the corner of fifth the car rolled to a stop in front of the bus station the two officers climbed out and with night sticks in hand walked toward the door of the only  place in town to be open at that hour  am a big picture window grimy with water spots from a recent shower and covered with insects around the neonlighted beer signs showed the men plainly that the establishment had no customers for either the bus or the small cafe inside the bigger of the two men who had a red face and a large paunch opened the door they both went inside and stood hands on hips gazing around there were two waiting rooms in the building and two drinking fountains both sets were equally dirty though and the waiting rooms were littered with old magazines and a conglomeration of paper cups napkins and cigarette butts on the floor when are you going to clean up this mess mae asked the policeman a hawkfaced small man in his early twenties he then threw his cigarette butt into the litter and the other policeman did the same i didnt hire out to be a janitor said the plump middleaged blond who wore her hair in the ringlets so popular in the shirley temple era she was mae bradley the combination ticket agent waitress and general gossip for the night shift the two men laughed and took off their western style hats they moved over to a small table pulled out three chairs and plopped down the bradley woman brought three steaming mugs of coffee and turned back to the counter keavy she said to the small hawkfaced man i cant remember if you do take sugar in your coffee or not he roared with laughter how come you dont have any trouble remembering what dinnett here takes she blushed well keavy i the door opened just then and the three stopped their conversation to look at the new arrivals two negroes walked across the room toward the first waiting room the older one sat down while the younger gave him a twinetied carton to hold then the younger one walked toward the ticket counter he was a tall muscular man perhaps twentyeight years old although he had an air of positiveness about him as if he knew his way around he was dressed like a farm worker aside from an armystyle fatigue cap which he had removed and crumpled in his hand he wore a plaid shirt with frayed cuffs his levis had neat patches on the knees and were rolled to reveal high topped army boots these were popular with the farm hands since a recent case of snakebite in a cotton field he waited silently while mae bradley took her time about helping him want somepin she said from the table where she was still sitting with the two policemen i would like to ask the departure time of the new york coach he said onethirty same as always want a ticket she shifted her bulk in the chair no thank you i have one the man shifted his weight to one foot but may we have coffee please the two officers who had been staring at the young man both reached for their western style hats and put them on they made no move to get up however mae bradley got up with a sigh and moved towards the coffee urnshe drew two cups half full and pushed them across the counter slopping them on the way the big man forked into the watch pocket of his levis for some change he found two dimes and handed them to her fifteen cents each and lay it on the counter mae indicated the rubber thing with upright spikes which lay there to receive change wordlessly the negro dug again and found two more nickels he lay them with the others thank you sir she said sarcastically then she returned to her seat that wasnt funny mae i know what you meant though keavy said seriously he pushed the hat back on his forehead the western style hat was a new innovation of the hedonsville police force all five of them it did however look rather out of place in such a small southern town so very far from the west carrying the two cups of cofiee the man moved back toward a table near the first waiting room he pulled out a chair for the older man and himself and they both sat down with their backs to the others although the signs labeling the waiting rooms and drinking fountains for being for white and colored had been removed the cleaner spots in the wall showed where they had been it was however the same as if they still remained for no one ever violated the taboo even the icc ruling prohibiting discrimination which  was posted by the ticket office might just as well have not been there the older of the negroes had grey hair and a deeply lined face he was shabbily dressed in an old boy scout shirt which hadnt yet had the emblems removed his pants were the army fatigue kind with the big pockets on the sides the old shoes he wore were too big for him and even turned up at the toes a little he seemed proud though and as he sat talking to the younger man you could determine that he was someone who had a purpose in life officers dinnett and keavy were still staring at the backs of the two negroes keavy spoke whos he the old ones pop claridge he lives in the shack at the far end of harlan street and takes care of the dump dinnett lit another cigarette no i mean the other one the big jig keavy also lit a cigarette i guess the young guy must be his soni think his names david i think he goes to college somewhere in the north dinnett got up and went to another table to find an ashtray then he came back and sat down again mae bradley gave one of her high pitched laughs he dont look like no college man to me dont blame him none dinnett laughed and then stamped out his cigarette in the ashtray if he started lookin too fancy we might have to haul him injust on suspicion of course he laughed again very loudly david claridge and his father turned briefly to look at him then they resumed their intense conversation if hes goin back to new york i hope he stays keavy stamped out his cigarette also those ones whos been to the north come bringin all those ideas might brainwash our young folks the door opened just then and slim hankins the night cab driver came in carrying two blue suitcases after he got inside he sat them down by the door and held it open for the young woman who followed him in just then the new york express pulled up outside after it rolled to a stop the door opened and the driver stepped out he began to help the passengers out for the rest stop the ones who were awake that is slim put the suitcases in the baggage compartment then he waited while the young woman paid him he waved at the officers and mae bradley then he left the sleepy wrinkled wobbly line of passengers lined up at the lunch counter so mae reluctantly got up to serve them see you later boys she said while mae was busy at the counter the young woman who had just arrived went to the ticket booth to wait for service dinnett lit another cigarette hey keavy aint that old man watsons daughter yeah dinnett i used to date her in high school remember keavy stared at the girl unashamedly shes even got on the earrings i gave her oh i forgot dinnett replied you dated so many of them that i couldnt keep up is she fun shes a prude if thats what you mean and shes a little bit too much of a brain to suit me otherwise shes nice keavy continued to stare at her wonder where shes goin dawn watson straightened her blue dacron dress and ran her hand over her brown hair she carried her small suitcase in her left hand when she finally saw mae coming toward her she sat the suitcase on the floor the plump fortyish blond with the ringlets stood for a minute regarding the slim young girl a bitter smile crossed maes face where to mae asked new yorkone way dawn watson replied forty thirtyfive mae said without referring to the large ratebook dawn opened her purse and brought out four ten dollar bills then she dug in her coin purse and extracted thirtyfive cents in change she handed it all to mae mae took the money without asking her to place it on the counter and then she began to write out a ticket the bus driver had been having pie and coffee now he finished got up from his table and went to the center of the room will the passengers please reclaim their seats in the bus were due to leave in five minutes people began to walk slowly back to the bus most of them looking a bit more awake and refreshed than they had when they arrived the driver tagged dawns two suitcases and then carried them to the baggage compartment in the side of the bus dawn still carried her smallest suitcase her ticket envelope was clutched tightly to her purse she walked toward the side door of the station following the line of people david claridge and his father got up and shook hands then they embraced each other as if they expected it to be a long time before they met again david walked toward the line of people entering the bus outside the side door and took his place behind dawn guess we better think about goin ourselves keavy said he got up and began to walk towards the side door of the station im coming dinnett said he also got up and with a wave to mae followed keavy see ya boys mae called out she was waiting on a customer who was hurrying to buy a candy bar to carry aboard the bus keavy was looking out through the side door watching the passengers get on the bus hey dinnett come here dinnett quickly joined his partner at the door  look how close hes standing to her man hes helpin her on the bus should i nab him keavy clenched his fists better not might be tourists on the bus and we cant afford any incidents see if his old mans still there dinnett looked around the waiting room but mr claridge was nowhere to be seen must have faded through the front door i guess all the passengers were aboard and the driver had shut the door the bus had started to roll down the driveway it stopped when it reached main street the driver shifted gears looked both ways and started to turn left in the di  rection of the highway gosh no man look at that keavys face turned white and beads of perspiration appeared suddenly he pointed what dinnett said his eyes following the line of keavys finger no keavy and dinnett seemed to recover from their shock at the same moment then they started to run after the bus they ran waving their arms the driver turned out the inside lights on the bus just then and all was darkness on the inside when dinnett and keavy reached the middle of the street they saw it was too late keavys hat had fallen off and he went back to get it with my earrings on too he mumbled the bus gathered speed now that it was past the city limits most of the passengers had gone back to sleep near the back of the bus sat a large dark man dressed in levis and a plaid shirt he sat on the seat by the aisle on the luggage rack overhead was a carton from which a dress suit and shirt had been removed on the inside seat beside the man sat a girl in a blue dacron dress she was holding the suit and shirt on her lap her small suitcase was on the floor beside her it was very dark in the bus now there was a new moon which didnt give much light each of the seats had small reading lights for the passengers but few were on in the rear it was especially dark the girl grasped the mans large hand and held it in both of hers then he leaned over put his arm around her and gave her a long hard kiss the bus reached the highway then and turned north toward new york
in his struggle to ati e tain a better present £ and more hopeful future the negro sometimes forgets the importance of the past which gives him roots the negro is not a newcomer to the annals of world history but can look back to a participation in international affairs related to biblical areas which dates back at least  years to  bc when negro soldiers served in the royal egyptian armies by  bc negro monarchs ruled over the egyptian empire and fought against powerful assyrian armies many negroes have read the old testament carefully or have sung spirituals such as joshua fit the battle of jericho based on biblical themes but few of them realize the extent of the negro role in the bible very few for example are aware of the fact that moses married a negro wife and his sister miriam was punished with a loathsome disease when she made unkind remarks about her brothers spouse  josephus the great jewish historian tells about the background of this negro woman in greater detail than the bible he notes that moses as a general in the egyptian army laid siege to the royal city of ethiopia tharbis the daughter of the king fell in love with moses and sent messengers to him offering her hand in marriage after the city was captured with the aid of tharbis moses married her and took her back with him to egypt when absalom davids beloved son was killed after his attempt at rebellion joab the general of the army of israel sent a trusted negro retainer to deliver the sad message to the king when the great prophet jeremiah was imprisoned by his enemies and cast into a mirefilled cistern it was ebedmelech the ethiopian negro courtier who informed king zedekiah about the seers perilous situation ebedmelech was then ordered by the king to take charge of  men and lift jeremiah out of the cistern after his rescue jeremiah received a divine message which declared that ebedmelech would be saved from the foes sword because he had put his trust in the lord the book of kings relates that taharqa the valiant negro ruler of egypt was an ally of king hezekiah and helped him in his battle of  bc against sennacherib the mighty assyrian chief the assyrian armies were stricken by a plague as they stood before the walls of jerusalem and the survivors were compelled to leave the holy land shortly after this sennacherib died his successor esarhardon then defeated the forces of taharqa in a subsequent battle taharqa was captured and the assyrian king set up a victory monument which showed him holding ropes attached to taharqas shackled figure somehow however taharqa managed to escape and after reassembling his troops through brilliant military tactics drove the assyrians out of the delta as scholars dig about the ruins of the ancient near east and are able to reconstruct the past it is quite likely that we shall learn more about the negros part in the biblical world just as archaeology has presented important information about great african empires so too will it shed more light on the history of the negro in bible lands
