one of the wisest people i ever knew once said to me if you care at all about living in this world you must also re enough to help save it from its own wilderness get those words i shall never forspoken by my mother as we sat watching an oklahoma sunset more than thirty years ago it was just before i returned to college for my final year and it seemed to me that she was giving me my own special commencement address albeit a bit prematurely the words she used in bestowing her benediction on me reflected her own experience in the early days of oklahoma when as a teacher in the indian territory she had witnessed one of this nations last battles against a wilderness frontier although her language was evocative of the continuing american struggle to beat back the wilderness and to plant a civilization we both knew that she had something else in mind she was in fact talking of the responsibility of every human being to venture toward new wildernesses  toward new frontiersand to help create there a new meaningful pattern of life this would in turn help solve some of the problems that perennially seemed to engulf the world the context in  was the worldwide depression the darkening shadows of the barbarism of nazism and the ugly conduct of the american racists who had snatched a negro youth from our college campus the previous spring and lynched him the problems were old only the setting was new a generation has come and gone a great and tragic world war has been fought a score of new nations have emerged new wildernesses have been discovered and conquered we have entered an exciting frightening nuclearspace age the power of man either to destroy his world or to transform it into a material paradise has multiplied enormously one need not be ashamed to admit that it is a rare and wonderful privilege to be able to witness the marvels of this age even the least observant among us has seen a dozen miracles that would eclipse the ingenuity of a  leonardo da vinci or strain the credulity of a jules verne the more naive among us can say with alexander the great that there are no more worlds to conquer or with frederick jackson turner that the frontier is indeed closed but the changes of the last generation however dramatic and worldshaking have neither eliminated all the frontiers nor saved the world from its own wildernesses the rivalry among the nuclear powers has created a new wilderness while the new means of automation have had in some quarters a chilling and depressing effect this is not to say that we have made no progress in the art of utilizing our resources in the fundamental task of creating a peaceful world this is not to say that we have not made a start toward creating a society in which the fundamentals of decency in human relations might be observed but the progress has been minimal and the frontiers beckoning our discovery and assiduous efforts are numerous as a people and as a nation we have been attracted through the years toward what can be called frontiers of freedom the earliest settlers sought religious and economic freedom the founding fathers fought for political freedom certain basic freedoms in the form of the bill of rights were early written into our constitution at times we sought to justify our expansionist policies on the rather shaky ground that we were seeking to extend the area of freedom now and then some americansall too frequently a courageous minority have spoken and worked for complete human freedom these stands for freedom going far back into our history suggest that as the peoples of the world seek a better order we in this country have some qualifications for taking the lead in seeking out new frontiers of freedom and doing battle against the wildernesses that surround them up to this point in our development however we can claim more credit for eloquence than for precision of concepts more credit for zeal than for its effective and purposeful use almost two centuries ago we declared that all men were created equal but the concept of equality did not extend to everyone from that day to this we have experienced the greatest difficulties conceivable in attempting to establish a society characterized by real equality and real freedom ttiis is because of that early faltering when we showed so little understanding of the meaning and dimensions of freedom it is remarkable how in the name of freedom we fought so valiantly for our political independence and at the same time renounced the one great opportunity to show that we were committed to human freedom it is worth noting that one of our most vigorous thrusts toward equality was jacksonian democracy but this great upsurge of the common man did not even address itself to the most vital challenge that democracy was facingthe challenge of slavery a generation later universal suffrage seemed to be at hand but new and ingenious devices were invented to exclude millions from that high privilege and so the opportunity for real equality and real freedom to become the central feature of american life and institutions got lost in a maze of racism that in turn created a veritable wilderness if that wilderness was to be won for freedom it would require courage and resourcefulness to say the least the curious thing is that as a people and as a nation we have taken pride in our advocacy of freedom even when our actions have betrayed an ambivalence that was as full of wonder as it was lacking in merit for centuries not a sufficient number appreciated the violence that this ambivalence was doing to the nature and character of our society to do anything about it instead with a pride that was somewhat vainglorious if not altogether false we began to proclaim to the world that our social order had achieved a perfection that commended itself to the entire world with a perfect society or one that was nearly perfect americans saw no reason why they should not share their blessings with others lacking the capacity to criticize the imperfections of their own society they became its evangels proclaiming freedom and democracy for all the peoples of the world thus in recent years we have been engaged in a gigantic task of extending what we call the area of freedom we have done this by providing billions of dollars worth of military technical and economic aid to many nations of the world in our moments of charity we call them the underdeveloped nations in our moments of reverie we call them the freedomloving peoples last week i returned from another visit to some of the nations that are the objects of our concern on the basis of my quite inconclusive observations and conversations i am not persuaded that they are either underdeveloped or freedomloving in the sense that we use those words to be sure many of them lack scientific and technical skills but their leaders are wise in the ways of the world and are as sophisticated and cunning as our most wily political masters their peoples may not be free in our sense of the term and they might even be freedomloving but their aspirations to freedom bear little if any relationship to our own as often as not they want to be free of any influence or domination including that of the united states they want to be free to make the critical decisionseven if they are wrong decisionsabout their own future they want no neatly wrapped packages proffered to them by us or someone else they want to be free to select the things  that appeal to them and reject those that do not a few days ago the minister of education in a middle east country sought to explain this stance to me having spent some time in the united states he drew his illustration from american higher education we are like your undergraduate student when he begins to make out his program of courses the minister said he has some freedom of choice on the basis of his background tastes and interests he takes certain electives we must have at least that much freedom in making the choices before us the analogy is not very strained and on many an occasion we as a nation have watched with the greatest interest and anxiety as people like the ministermake their choices if they do not choose as we had hoped we are inclined to fret and to wonder if they really did have freedom of choice in our moment of pique we fail to ask ourselves such important questions as were we offering the kind of aid the kind of values the kind of institutions that had meaning and substance for the prospective recipients what kind of quid pro quo was involved in the offer if there was one did it involve demands that left little if any free choice we see then that in two vastly different areas of activity a great and resourceful country like ours has real difficulty in discovering those frontiers on which to carry on an effective battle for the freedom of mankind at home our early inconsistencies and our unwillingness to establish and maintain a concept of universal freedom did much to create a wilderness on that allimportant frontier of freedom in our dealings with other peoples our inability to see the ideal of freedom in their own frames of reference has created problems that remain unsolved despite our vigorous efforts to cope with them it is for these reasons that it seems to me we should seek new approaches new frontiers on which to establish and maintain not only the ideal but the practice of freedom it is by no means easy to seek out new frontiers and pursue them but we should care enough about our future and the future of our world to make the attempt    it hardly seems necessary to observe that for several centuries our search for such frontiers has been negligible or halfhearted during those years we defined freedom in rather narrow terms two centuries ago religious freedom meant that the puritans could worship god as they pleased but not the quakers a century ago real human freedom was for whites but not for negroes privilege was for gentiles but not for jews the same has been true in our dealings with other peoples we have managed somehow to convince ourselves that other peoples become free when they accept our way of looking at things or even our leadership as well as our material aid we have convinced ourselves for example that extraterritorial agreements and status of forces legislation required of other countries by us do not challenge the integrity of the peoples whose freedom we supposedly champion and our soldiers technicians and advisers deployed all over the world and enjoying special privileges of every conceivable kind simply do not convince their hosts that they are there to act as equal partners in a common enterprise implicit in our attitudes is not merely failure to appreciate the concept of equality in a common cause it also smacks of an ethnocentrism that fails utterly to comprehend the fact that fresh invigorating concepts of freedom can indeed come from other societies it implies certain basic reservations on our part regarding the place of equality and freedom in the lives of the peoples that make up those societies it also indicates a smugness and a certainty with regard to our own position that are not all justified in the light of our experience frankly i do not know what the longrange impact of our contact with other people will be and i doubt that anyone knows the task of transplanting into a quite different social order our own notions of freedom and equality and justice however estimable is staggering to contemplate the forces of resistance in the societies themselves and by others with different concepts and programs are powerful indeed and our own blurred concept of what freedom is and how it can be universally applied merely compounds the difficulties what we really need to do is to clarify our own view of the nature of freedom and to identify the new frontiers on which it can be applied if freedom is anything at all it is the opportunity to seek complete personal fulfillment so long as it does not deprive others of the same opportunity in this context public restrictions are minimal and personal responsibilities are maximal public or private actions or conspiracies to reduce the freedom of any person or group are socially irresponsible actions conversely the use of ones own freedom to advance the freedom of others is on the face of it socially responsible the extension of the principles and practices of freedom acknowledges a universal character that is the very hallmark of freedom there can be no double standards for freedom freedom cannot possibly mean on the one hand every opportunity for the enjoyment of privilege on park avenue and on the other the deliberate creation and maintenance of blight and poverty in harlem it cannot mean the grafting of american values through the preponderant american presence on the developing countries and at the same time showing an utter insensitivity to the values and aspirations of the developing countries themselves the commitment to one standard of freedom for one people or one place and another standard for others is itself a clear denial of free dom what we need to doindeed what we must doas socially responsible people is to seek new frontiers of freedom not merely for the sake of others but for ourselves as well we can begin by extending and enlarging the areas of freedom in the harlems across this nation if we do not know what our impact can be on the faraway frontiers we can be certain of our impact on the frontiers close at hand people on these local frontiers already have the same values the same aspirations and indeed their notions of freedom are a part of the same culture as the rest of the country we know from experience that whenever we have assured complete freedom to people in our midst the very recognition of their right to be free and equal has had a salutary effect on the growth and development of our social order yet in the face of this rich and positive experience we have failed to complete the task of eliminating the privation discrimination and the denial of equality that stalks our land it can be arguedindeed it has been arguedthat a commendable beginning has been made and that is indeed true but a beginning is not enough there is no legitimate halfway station between slavery and freedom george orwell has suggested the absurdity of trying to make a valid distinction among wouldbe equals and there is the same absurdity if we should seek to make invidious distinctions among those who would be free we who have a sense of responsibility in the search for new frontiers of freedom must therefore become totally and unequivocally committed to total freedom and the best place to begin is here and now in this community if we accept this responsibility acknowledge the fact that any freedom worth cherishing must be universal and work diligently to destroy inequality discrimination and segregation in our own communities we shall be well on our way toward saving our communities from their own wildernesses only then will we have gained the experience and indeed the right to extend the areas of freedom beyond our own borders only then can we face the world and declare that by experience and by example we have proved that human beings can live in a world where there are no reservations in the right to enjoy total freedom i suspect that such a stance will itself provide new resources with which to extend the area of freedom you who go down from this place today have i believe not only a vital interest but a vital stake in the search for new ways to achieve freedom the wellbeing of this community depends in large measure on the manner in which you and others like you assume your responsibilities the peace of the world depends among other things on what all of us can do to carry forward the objective of freedom and dignity for all peoples and thus to save the world from its own wilderness  
this informal f np i article is an at ii f tempt to share    some of the impressions and ideas which result from about six months residence in south carolina during this period i have been working as educational consultant in a coeducational liberal arts negro college with an enrollment of  students the purpose of the assignment was improvement of academic standards my conclusions are drawn largely from experience with this educational institution although community relations are reflected in my judgments it should be remembered that i came not as a militant integrationist or as a crusader from the righteous north to a sinful south my mission was that of dealing with a limited aspect of the larger problem the objective was the academic improvement of a specified college any involvement in the total race problem is incidental or reached through necessary connection with higher education one of these necessary connections is that in this society the whole range of educational accomplishment especially at the secondary level in negro schools is shockingly low when one writes about the inadequacy of preparation for college work it appears to be merely a repetition of the nationwide lament of college officials but the degree of failure in our situation here is so great that the word inadequate has a different meaning imagine one half of the entering class unable to write an intelligible paragraph add to this the inability to construct a simple sentence so that aggregations of words without subject and with mismated verb forms must serve the vocabulary is extremely limited with frequent replacement of an intended word by one of somewhat similar sound an honor senior student trying to convey to me his lack of prejudice came out with i am trying to be just as objectionable as possible reading as the art of gaining ideas from a printed page is equally deficient the college with which i am associated does not use college entrance examination board scores in a similar institution the verbal average is below  compare this with bates average of over  on a scale with  as top score the citing of these sad facts does not imply any endorsement of nonsense about an inferior race with low mental capacity the southern white student shows a similar though less extreme disparity when rated on a national scale undoubtedly the negro student had as good a mind at birth as the average child and there are only the usual variations nevertheless at the present moment so far as achievement in education or meeting competition in a free society is concerned the negro student is in practically the same situation as he would be if he were mentally deficient many doors are closed many elements of a curriculum cannot be used by him as a means of selfdevelopment and growth the allimportant difference is that something can be done about it so far as youth is concerned education is the key instrument a cultural deficiency can be overcome by any normal individual with ambition and energy provided the right institutions and methods are available and utilized we have every reason to believe that a considerable proportion of young negroes will emerge from a disadvantageous background with capacities developed for full and rewarding participation in american life the next long step toward such a goal is dependent chiefly upon negro colleges under competent negro leaders with the present and future overcrowding of highly selective white colleges possessing an established clientele and with high costs it is only the rare southern negro who will find his way into one of them the attempt of some northern universities to establish special programs for the inadequately prepared negro applicant is a generous gesture of good will but like so many of our futile efforts it is essentially one more random activity confusing and weakening our central purpose it is positively dangerous in its tendency toward perpetuating double standards at the very best these efforts can meet so small a part of the need that the direct result is negligible the negro college has been attempting to meet the problem of poor preparation in one of two ways the first is the establishment of adequate remedial courses with which the student by greater intensity of effort or by a longer time span is brought to the point of a legitimate bachelors degree the second method is the offering of a low grade curriciulum of inferior courses and a low standard of grading that demands little effort until the candidate is given a pseudo ab or bs the second type has been somewhat acceptable in the past when its graduates went back into a depressed group there they could exert to a certain extent the leadership expected from them now we are intent upon making nonexistent the depressed subgroup and if we are successful there will be no place for such graduates in a free society all must meet in open competition hence the second type of negro college or white has become  useless and injurious it must be reformed or removed it is a positive block to genuine integration legislation and good will can open opportunity for the competent but no amount of either can open a magic path for the unprepared a considerable lifting of the level of the general negro group must occur before the potentially superior individual with qualities which our society rewards can emerge in significant numbers this elevation is the opportunity and duty of negro colleges sheer physical integration in residence area church or school is more consequence than cause we need to develop a concept of integration much more profound than mere abolition of segregation we idealists easily overestimate the readiness and eagerness of the great mass of negroes apart from intellectualists and activists to join in important aspects of a predominantly white culture at the operative level or in a spiritual and deeply personal way this genuine integration must be clearly distinguished from the superficial level with which most popular discussion is concerned some few negro students of college age can now feel comfortably at home in a white college but in the deep south their number is small the emotional and psychological factors are more clearly evident in a church situation why should a family leave a church whose ways are familiar in which friends of long standing are met each sunday in which there are tender memories of weddings and funerals in which leadership is exerted and offices held how can the loyalties thus engendered be replaced by affiliation with an organization in which the same conditions cannot exist for the present generation the more intimate and personal the relationship the more deeply rooted in sentimental and personal values the more difficult and prolonged is the process of genuine integration nearly every negro can appreciate the privilege of entrance into good stores though the economic realities prevent much buying i have heard a negro professional man relate repeatedly and with great gusto of his meeting with a mixed professional group in one of the finest and most expensive hotels and how he leaned back in those big stuffed leather chairs these superficial aspects of a surrounding culture from where there has been exclusion rank high in the minds of most men the slow effort of growing into the sentiments attitudes and skills required for their production recedes into the background the desire for economic equality with the successful members of the society is predominant and most of the privileges sought are steps to that end or indicators of its partial achievement personal prestige is so closely linked with economic status that the two cannot be separated in motivation the drive for personal prestige is immediate and powerful while it is in the center of thought little effective attention is given to the obligations required for being at home and competent in the new social complex the merging of a subculture with the dominant surrounding one demands a certain amount of mutual accommodation and modification neither culture will be precisely what it was before however one or the other will be predominant with its mores and values setting the general pattern may we not assume when integration is completed that our industrial technological scienceoriented urban civilization will persist and that all persons must adjust in varying degrees to its standards if this is true then the distinctive task of negro education is the development or inculcation of qualities and attitudes as well as skills required in such a society this should be accompanied by the personal enrichment that we believe to be the function of liberal arts and accomplished with the minimum destruction of desirable elements characteristic of the subculture but it must be accomplished whether we personally like or dislike this civilization is irrelevant it is folly to suppose that in any foreseeable future it will be replaced by a more easygoing one that makes less demands for individual and corporate selfdiscipline racial in tegration will not stem the prevailing trend my thesis is that the new society will be essentially as it is continuing in the same channel and developing in the same pattern those who are successfully to share in it and in its rewards as the negro wishes to must accommodate themselves to its demands this does not deny individual variations or modest changes initiated by gifted persons it grants the right of any individual who does not value its rewards to set up his own private domain and to live independently so far as is possible in a society upon which he is so largely dependent such quasiindependence is not the ambition of most negroes i find three ways in which the negro as i have seen him must be reconditioned educated if he is to become reasonably adequate in our society i hope the examples cited do not seem trivial it may be that any one standing alone is not sufficiently indicative but in the aggregate they show traits that are supremely important let it be clearly understood that there is no intention to impute blame but only to recognize significant facts of a present condition first perhaps underlying the others is a basic habit of living in a world of illusion a daydream world by which there may be relief from the unpleasant impact of stark reality in my experience this year so long as the usual appurtenances  associated with the image of a college are present what lies beneath is largely ignored colleges have sororities fraternities and impressive athletic teams so we must have them very much in view considerable sums of money are spent on these features though the poverty of students is so great that tuition and academic fees are paid on the installment plan administrative offices are equipped with the latest intercommunication system for my own office a dictating machine was proposed although my secretary is not trained to transcribe from the device the catalog contains a large selection of courses which have not been given for years the most elaborate registration card i have ever seen is used in spite of the fact that very few students can master its complexity sufficiently to fill it out correctly honors are granted to certain graduates upon very easy grounds in short by surrounding ones self with the paraphernalia and procedures thought of as pertaining to a regular college it is forgotten that they do not constitute a college there is a feeling of satisfaction that the correct image is presented to the public and visitors are properly impressed the appearance becomes subjectively the reality windowdressing serves in place of a stock of educational goods if the southern association of colleges penetrates far enough to take a dim view and accreditation is imperiled there is recourse to the feeling that racial prejudice and discrimination are at work when for many generations a people has lived in a situation which denied participation in the good life so richly apparent on every side some compensatory defense mechanism must be built up religion so easily and so often distorted to serve such ends becomes a prime source of comfort prevented by the selfinterest of the dominant group from having application to the righting of social wrongs it finds expression among negroes in emotional perceptiondulling worship soulstirring escapes from trouble and miraculous transmutation of fortune reported in biblical tradition are embodied and relived in song poetry and sermon all the usual otherworldly aspects are exaggerated and emphasized when the present world has consistently presented harsh denial of universal human hopes the human spirit finds relief in the only realm easily available the world of imaginative illusion out of this habit of the elders the college is in all things most religious but without consequences in overt behavior it may be noted that the younger generation is becoming increasingly restive with this diet of husks its apparent irreligion may be useful until religion again becomes worthy of devotion such a realm of illusion is not compatible with the world into which the negro is now being introduced any successful career demands a careful analysis of facts faithful acceptance of them and rational conduct based upon actual relation of a present situation to the desired result in this respect integration is a oneway road the negro must be conditioned toward the facing of hard facts there will be disaster for those who fail to make the transition the plight of the unadaptable will be worse than in the past since the old protective walls of race solidarity will be gone most of the retraining will take place in the education of youth this creates the opportunity and obligation for negro colleges adequate leadership must be found many smaller colleges without alert leaders will remain unaware of the nature of the crisis until the tides of social change sweep them into oblivion these colleges for nearly a century have been accepting candidates utterly unprepared for college work giving them four years of undemanding curriculum and a purely gratuitous degree then the graduate most often has gone into teaching to continue the bad tradition such a college finds it hard to realize that the role it has been playing no longer serves any useful purpose the second set of attitudes which must be changed if wholesome and successful union is to be achieved integration at a far deeper level than mere ingestion of negroes into localities institutions and industries are those relating to ethical conduct we are here on very delicate ground and must avoid harsh judgments when people have been systematicallyover a long period deprived by a group with power over them then two things occur there is a strong feeling of justification for almost any means of defense which furthers the interest of the ingroup against the outgroup the concept of ethical obligation becomes inoperative toward the offenders it seems right to use any means to establish a better balance of advantages then practices justified for group advantage are transferred for the benefit of the individual as against other members within the group our whole society is so weak at this point that the analysis of any subgroup is indeed throwing stones from a glass house however my recent experience leads me to believe that there is a more than usually complacent acceptance of institutional practices based upon the fact that elementary ethical conduct is not to be expected when my office was furnished the pen was chained to its socket to prevent theft by student janitor or other raider before the first chapel service the amplifier system was stolen from the building a special police officer is on duty during reg istration when fees are being received in registration it is recognized that special precautions must be taken to prevent fraudulent change of schedule after approval by adviser indicative in another direction is the strict requirement for certification of freedom from venereal disease before admission regulations are more honored in the breach than in the observance procedures clearly stated in the catalog have not been observed for many years it is hard to draw the line separating laxity or inefficiency and actual dishonesty in some of these matters either is unacceptable in business and professional life today here is another oneway road in integration the third set of attitudes is indifference to time failure to regard engagements as important and habitual tardiness deadlines have no meaning procrastination is the order of the day consequently nothing gets done properly every action is a temporizing patchwork of emergency measures to meet the crisis induced by previous delay or neglect a request for a report from faculty members on a matter for the benefit of their respective departments met with a  per cent response by the date set catalog material known a year in advance to be due at a certain date is in process of revision weeks after that date nearly  per cent of the students were late in completing registration the penalty prescribed in the catalog was not imposed on anyone apparently the majority of the college community is sufficiently satisfied with conditions to prevent any urge for change perhaps we all would like to live in such a nevernever land and avoid the necessities of the modern timeoriented world the difficulty is that it cannot be both ways an orderly productive efficient society cannot be a disorganized chaotic drifting society the results of the latter will not be the results of the former for good or ill our social order is working toward the former and accepts it as an ideal once more there is a oneway road in conclusion and summary i confess again the limitations of my direct experience both in duration and extent however the sar npling observed has a considerable geographical distribution and represents a better status than the average among the mass of negroes in the deep south therefore there seems tc be justification for the conclusion reached that conclusion is based upon the premise that a subgroup incorporated into another group dominant in numbers resources and achievement must largely conform to and accept major standards of the dominant group dominant in this usage carries no evil implications the wish merely to participate in the benefits without sharing in the process is utterly futile the necessity of acceptance is not dependent upon the perfection of the ways of the dominant group nor upon whether we or others approve them these ways are stubbornly given the negro group of the deep south through its actions expresses three traits which are incompatible with the prevailing american outlook they are preoccupation with a world of illusion certain standards of ethical conduct and disregard for the importance of time and order the existence of many greatly admired negro individuals who do not show these traitsand of many individual whites who dodoes not negate the conclusion as applied to the major body of the group in the south the segregationalist assumes these traits are innate not capable of change so he rejects the possibility of successful integration this paper on the contrary is based upon the premise that they are the result of social conditioning hence modifiable by that further controlled social conditioning which we call education integration in any meaningful sense of the word can occur only when this reconditioning has happened upon a large scale for a long time the greater part of this education must be carried on by negro colleges to find leadership for these colleges is a most important step at this moment the finding of money for them is almost but not quite as urgent northern good will might be best expressed by affluent colleges that would deny themselves some contributions from philanthropists or foundations so that large grants can be given to the negro colleges that are aware of the role they must play
last january as i was preparing to go to nigeria to do a television film thomas o echewa a nigerian published in negro digest an arafricans vs afromr echewa did not bond between us as much as he described how superior africans think themselves to negroes his article was an unjustifiable piece of misplaced snobbery it made me angry for you see there is nothing like a trip to africa to make an american negro realize just how american he isand i had spent four months there in  and was returning within six months later on my  trip i met malcolm_x in lagos he was just beginning to turn the corner to brotherhood i dont know if africa did that on my last journey i met and talked at length with james meredith who had started out to do two years in ibadan in nigeria he lasted  months i dont know if africa did that many of my good friends went to africa disgusted at the way things were going here for negroes all have returned gladly did africa do that too one thing africa does make the most oppressed american black stop and think i was not able to answer mr echewas article when it came out but i want to do so now i am not an expert on africa i was in ten countries longest in nigeria but before i ever thought of going to africa i had worked as information director for the american committee on africa i was not therefore naive about africa i am not naive about anything i had known enough about africans and their politics not to look for any special favors because i was black i think this background gives me the credentials to answer mr echewa he chides us for assuming that we negroes mistakenly believe every african to be the son of a chief or village head that is not our fault that is the fault of the africans for spreading that hogwash  among us believe it or not the first twelve africans i ever knew all claimed to be the sons of tribal chiefs one must understand the historical and almost psychopathic desire for status among africans to make allowance for the young men who announced themselves as the first sons of chiefs i understand it but i wont allow mr echewa to place the fault where it doesnt belong the day i arrived back in nigeria i called on my friend chinua achebe the novelist his first words almost were john whats this i keep hearing about negroes and africans disliking each other i was a little surprised but we are good enough friends not to throw curves at each other yes i said there is a lot of talk and i think to a great degree it is true but lets get it out in the open and have done with it get about the business of really creating a bond between us history shows us how white people have always fought like animals with each other and their bond was color very often we dont want to make that same mistake we cant afford to achebe agreed i think these words apply to mr echewa to every african and to every afroamerican we have to face it the negroafrican romance that began in  when ghana became independent is over finished too many negroes have been to africa now via the peace corps usaid state department etc and they know despite what mr echewa says that africans by and large do not like american negroes much of this is history the african knows very little about our history of slave revolts of our total participation in all of americas wars they know only what they read and that is slanted poorly written and serves only to make the african feel superior because after all he is on that continent which is more or less politically independent the economic situation is something else when an american negro shows up in mr echewas home without ties to the us government he is a paradox how can a black american so poor so brutally treated at home so deprived afford to come to africa the obvious answer is that what the african reads today may not be valid tomorrow and one must remember too that the tradition of tribalism in africa is deeply historic and may even be powerful enough to destroy those nations that now have independence tribalism has caused nigeria a tremendous amount of trouble and europeans and white american policies have taken advantage of it the american black being without tribe or clan but being black all the same is considered a lost soul in the eyes of the african a man without a tribe is next to worthless a tribal society does create builtin superiority complexes i asked a highranking official about the closeknit families among the ibos of eastern nigeria the ibos are a gentle people and one senses a great depth in them the official said haughtily that the ibos were different from the rest of the nigerians he you see was a yoruba from the west with such an attitude it is quite clear that despite what mr echewa says he and most africans do mean to offend american blacks when they say they dont want to be referred to as negroes but i want to remind him that the europeans could not have drained africa of millions and millions of people to become slaves in the west if african leaders and chiefs had not helped them it is easy enough to blame the british french dutch portuguese and spanish but the africans have to share that blame as well tinubu square in the heart of lagos honors a woman who sold her own people into slavery contempt mr echewa should be deserved over the years ive noticed other ways in which the african communicates his contempt for american blacks he will have little to do with a negro unless he is told that the negro is suchandsuch and does soandso mostly the african will ignore the negro like a block of wood a few years ago i had a party in my apartment i believe it was when togo became independent many africans came i noticed as time wore on that there was a fellow who was flicking his cigarette ashes on the floor instead of in the ashtray finally he ground the cigarette underfoot and walked casually away incensed i followed him and told him in no uncertain terms that my apartment was not a grass hut and to take himself out of it i thought that was an isolated instance since then a host of people who have had africans in their homes as guests have noted the same thing this is not carelessness it is calculated contempt perhaps this contempt lies in the fact that so many african nations are now independent it would be unfair not to point out that many negroes felt a bit of jealousy when the african nations started down freedom road we wanted full citizenship first but we have gotten over that generally mr echewa africans do sympathize with our struggles but specifically they dont give a damn and i for one am a little tired of hearing africans rant and rave about climbing into boats and coming over here to rescue us what damned boats what damned armies when you free angola and mozambique and south africa when you finally put an end to the slavery that still flourishes when you either eliminate or ameliorate tribal differences then ill listen to you right now your mouth is moving but you arent  saying much i agree with mr echewa that an unfriendly encounter between an african and a negro should not be the basis of a blanket opinion that africans are a pretty rotten lot let me set down the basis for my opin ions first i was there second i have many friends who were third i have nigerian friends and friends in other countries africans all who are there i think i have a lot of facts mr echewa i do not believe that the current attitudes of antagonism are the result of a single bad encounter on the part of a great many visiting negroes they are the result of many many bad encounters fifty times a day every day you are in africa a thumbnail sketch on nigeria since that is mr echewas home i arrived at kano at  in the morning kano is ghastly hot and dry and the largest city in northern nigeria one of the customs officers tried to take my typewriter the other my camera i refused to let them and refused to pay them dash the old african bribe money that left a bad taste and to see africans who cry how free i am all the time uncle tomming white people all over africa sickened me no negro in a private capacity can expect to be served before a white man in africa it just isnt done enough no i have been to a good many places in the world and the most rascally cab drivers so  far are nigerian paris cabbies dont even come near them new york city drivers would be completely wasted more in nigeria people who are poor seem to expect you to give them something just because you have it and they dont tribalism again but a great irritant in a country struggling to make good its independence it is nigerian tribalism that would keep mr echewa away from gangs of toughs unless he frequented such places as the kakadu or the caban bamboo in yaba a suburb of lagos where women are concerned class barriers fall with a resounding bang mr echewa seems really concerned about appearing to be white and being involved with white people so much let me be crass the upper echelon nigerian is more british than black just as the upper echelon senegalese is more french than black africans are not fools they woo the power structure in america and so far that has been white but since the american society from the s has been mostly concerned with social changes or progress it seems inevitable that before long power will be shared with black americans mr echewa you had better look to it in  i took an extensive trip around the nation usa by car i stopped at many colleges and universities wherever i went except in the south i was asked why it was that the african students preferred the whites to american blacks the question was asked of me often enough to have validity especially since it was asked not by negroes but by whites themselves living in new york it has been my experience that africans will attend mixed gatherings but seldom will appear at an allnegro one this past spring an official from the mission of an east african nation agreed to speak before a group of negro women the man did not show up call to apologize or send a note fifty women all colored in new york city now have a very embittered view of africa and her people since most of the africans who live in new york tend to have diplomatic status they do not live in negro neighhoods occasionally they get waylaid and beaten up and they raise hell but they will have little to do with our civil_rights groups being diplomats they should not but if they believe that color is an important thing then their behavior in having as little to do with groups of this type is unforgivable ralph bunche never found it difficult i have heard a negro usia official tell an african to wear his robes when visiting america so he would not be mistaken for an american negro the state department people also handpick the negroes and negro organizations for the visiting african to see firsthand one african friend told me the average african visiting new york or chicago is more afraid of his own brothers than the white people who have caused both our conditions i think this is true negroes never will get to know africa better mr echewa unless africans become more willing to let them instead of avoiding them the truth is that a visiting african may give one impression but he knows very well that the africa he boasts about has a long way to go and it doesnt matter if he himself has three large houses and two mercedes with a house full of servants the average african still lives in a mud hut with a thatched or corrugated metal roof the mud houses are not a put down they are in fact quite cool and sturdy the average african coming to a large city like lagos still may have to sleep in the street next to an open sewer the poor american black on the other hand usually has what he needs to be a member of his society near at hand through some social agency africans tend to hide this disparity if you get to know them well you get to know this and they dont want you to many feel ill at ease if they have to take you to visit their relatives who still live in the huts and rather than do this many will drop you as a friend another nigerian friend of mine who almost singlehandedly wiped out corruption in lagos which is an augean task and who did it so well that he was sent packing up to kano introduced me to his family there were two wives and many many children the house was partly of mud and the lighting was provided by candles this man had no sense of shame as he should not  have had i enjoyed his family and i think they enjoyed me i felt the richer for the pleasure of meeting them and it was only the second time i was ever invited into the home of mr average african the african like the negro deals with white values he should be ashamed he thinks and he is because his relatives live in a mud hut and a mud hut is a sign of savagery in white terms i think the african has just really started to gobble up white values negroes are further down the line they know them for what they are now mr echewa you know as well as i do that africans are as sophisticated and as crude as any other people probably cruder let me cite an example during my last trip to nigeria two people one british one american complained about africans going to parties drinking up all the whiskey that in itself was not bad but the fact that the africans seldom invited them to parties made the africans appear to be parasites they also complained that africans spoiled excellent cognac by mixing it with ginger alea most valid complaint to my mind both were going to buy cheap cognac so the africans could mix their gingerale with that now that doesnt sound like sophistication to me i have seen the sophisticated african at work and play and i am not impressed i have seen him suffer twenny hungry that is running through his civil service pay so quickly that he was hurting for the th of the month payday to come around again those africans who bear in mr echewas words the trade mark made in great britain or made in france are the beentosthe people who have been to england or france to school a takeoff on bantu a racial designation i have seen these fellows mr echewa with their briefcases filled with sandwiches pacing up and down the streets with a great deal of impatient sophistication nowadays the negro takes the fact of college education in stride he needs no labels to proclaim the fact that he is going or has gone and it seems to me that this is much closer to the sophistication mr echewa writes about the fact of hip that mr echewa discusses in his article is badly misunderstood hip always meant that a person was aware jomo kenyatta doesnt do the uncle willie or the monkey either but hes the hippest thing africa has turned out in recent years i confess that i was surprised at the way mr echewa employed the term negritude which as a doctrine is as racist as white supremacy most nigerians leave negritude to the french africans in case mr echewa doesnt know it yet the spokesman for negritude on the african continent leopold senghor is in the process of refining it he feels that the bantu peoplesand this includes people in the southern areas of nigeriaare inferior to the hamiticsemitic types such as the senegalese m senghor is the president of senegal my friend achebe believes that it is the white people who have caused and are still causing the gap between negroes and africans it is they after all who control and disseminate the word but now that we are aware of the fact of dissonances between us is there not something we can do first we can stop lying to each other in speeches african leaders say that they want their afroamerican brothers to return home that they are welcome realistically negroes would find little room in africa because there are not that many jobs available second because american education is rated tops in the world africans have a certain natural reluctance in competing with them two negro women both toplevel social workers in the states tried to get jobs in nigeria they were turned down cold not because of money they didnt want that muchbut because their educations were superior to the people with whom and for whom they would be working if african leaders truly want negroes it is within their means to invite them and devise programs in which they can make full use of their talents so lets stop lying about that on our side lets stop lying about flocking to africa in droves i met james farmer in nigeria in february and he had made a series of trips around africa and planned to organize some kind of program whereby negroes could go to africa i believe less and less that black americans have the desire they once had to quit the known for all its dubious qualities for the totally unknown so lets quit lying about that too another friend of mine a negro who once worked with the satellite tracking station near kano quit in order to work with the people they would have none of his engineering skills they made him live in a section of town reserved for those people who have no relatives the last i heard of this man he had moved down to lagos and was selling american chickens in a supermarket africans are going to have to stop speeding on the new jersey turnpike and spend more time with negroes they are going to have to show us one of these days mr average african not the glamorous africa with its new rivieratype houses or swanky and impossibly expensive hotels they are going to have to look at americas ne groes as realistically as white americans do and they are going to have to do that pretty quickly i do not think it is any accident that a major negro magazine failed to do well when it was published specifically for africa african leaders could not afford to let their people see just how well american blacks are doing in spite of racism in this land in addition to that perhaps africans just didnt care mr echewa saysand rightfully so that negroes have to expend more energy getting to know africans i think i may have pointed out already however that it is largely the african who is preventing us from doing just that furthermore africans dont know other africans that well most of the contact is made between africans of different countries from the top but not in the middle if there is such a thing and certainly not at the bottom i wrote a book on africa for children which is being used by three nigerian teachers in africa to instruct their pupils on the rest of the continent mr echewa is right once again when he suggests that we rid ourselves of the ignorance that lies between us he himself is woefully ignorant of just what does lie between us for example we are not as unprepared to rid ourselves of ignorance as he seems to think i would remind him that the currents of african independence began here not in africa at the first meeting of the panafricanism congress convened in london in  by the late w e b dubois one historian noted that at the outset panafricanism was a simple manifestation of fraternal solidarity between negroes of african descent from the british antilles and the united states of america to put it bluntly not a single africans presence was recorded at that first meeting in fact not until  at the fifth congress did they appear and among them were kwame nkrumah and jomo kenyatta i am glad mr echewa wrote his article otherwise i never would have written an answer to it many negroes who have been in africa refuse to let mr charlie know their true reactions to it and its people we have kept silent not so much for ourselves but because of our brothers back home but when the brothers play on the fact of our silences to put us down that is another thing finally i must note with cold objectivity that if africa produces such wisdom and sophistication and snobbery as mr echewa boasts why ever in the hell did he leave it to come to these united states the answer is obvious this racistridden land has something to offer even to mr echewa
john a williams makes a very strong pointif his point is that nigerian social standards are not as high as those of the u s he goes into some unnecessarily painful detail in making his point such as it is however as an answer to the article i wrote last january and within the clearly defined context of that article his letter is an exemplary piece of unbridled irrelevance perhaps mr williams has an argument to win hence all this vehemence and invective unfortunately nobody can win this argument because for every experience that illustrates one point another can be cited to illustrate the opposite if my intention were to champion the african side of the dispute then like mr williams i could assemble a vast amount of unilateral evidence to make my point on the contrary my intention was and still is to indicate the attitudes and tendencies which lead to the misunderstanding between africans and negro americans not endorsing these attitudes in either party but just pointing them out accordingly my tone was quite tentative mr williams must not close his eyes to the fact that few negroes have had the privilege or the bitter and disillusioning experience as he would probably call it of visiting africa so the battle ground is here not in nigeria the problem i treated concerned primarily the odd africans who are in this country the type of africans that the average negro can meet and probably has met this type of african is young a student and probably aboveaverage in his own national context some africans falsely claim to be the sons of chiefs however the status is often foisted on the rest of us by people who think we must all be princes to deserve to come to this gods country the african student here deals with all classes of negroesoften with the lower class ones i mean the cats with tarred hair needlesharp shoes red socks and sun glasses day and night dig then check it i am sure that mr williams will agree that there is a social and intellectual disparity here to give him a chance to get even i will concede that the average african can be quite primitive but he is not the kind you are likely to meet on main street i wonder why the obsession with mud huts and poor relatives oh well it is true that some africans pretend to many lofty things personally i will go as far as who goes the farthest in condemning such pretence nigerian social amenities bear no comparison to those of the u s however u s affluence worsens rather than mitigates the negros situation for as mr williams surely knows the most likely way for the average negro to get into one of those towering skyscrapers is as a janitor as for me i would always rather be a nigerian andlive in a mud hut than be so deprived in the midst of plenty i have a feeling mr williams and i will disagree on the definition of the average negro i hesitate to define one but i know he is not a college graduate far from it it is not unusual for professionalclass negroes to apply everything said about the negro to themselves forgetting that they are a negligible percentage of the negro population funny but i think that many professionalclass negroes are more ashamed of their poor relatives than the africans mr williams cited in his letter besides the negroes tend to have a complex about it whereas africans accept the inescapable tribal or familial bond with their relatives no matter how poor they are since mr williams is plagued by a common american malady a temptation to reduce all values to dollars i will introduce him to two very important notions notions which contribute very strongly to the pride of the african the first is the personal concept i exist i have a right to be i esteem myself highly one of the saddest aspects of segregation in the united states is that many negroes seem to have accepted and made peace with the degradation and secondrateness which the white society has forced on them africans on their part do have some unspoken inferiority complexes but theirs are not nearly as numerous or intense as the negroes at least not any more in this era of african independence we are exerting ourselves fully and projecting the african personality everywhere so the african one meets here usually has a proud carriage we have a lot to be proud of mr williams he is assertive and does not ask anybodys permission to be equal he takes his equality for granted many negroes on the other hand are still trying to run away from themselves from their color from their past they dont accept themselves as they are it is not news to anyone that lighter colored negroes usually consider themselves a shade superior to the darker ones they usually marry other lighter colored negroes they perform plastic surgery on their features i have been told that a leading negro university in this country used to be a blue vein school frankly i dont have much patience with people who are trying to be white but cant quite make it the second concept is one of belonging i belongto my family to my village the name of my village is umuamadi which means the sons of amadi we are about  strong and live together this is home to me no matter where else i may happen to be living i belong to my town clan tribe country time and time again i have tried to explain to some negro friends that the american concept of acceptance has no meaning in africa the tribal groups may not like one another but it is no groups prerogative to accept or reject the others tribalism is universal right here in america you have your wasps and wops and polaks and irish etc all sharing some sort of fellow feeling for members of their particular group and holding the rest in some sort of contempt elsewhere french canadians are fighting englishspeaking canadians flemishspeaking belgians are feuding with their frenchspeaking compatriots the english and the french hold one another in an unspoken mutual contempt these mr williams are examples of tribalism do you have a more civilized name for it in any case what has tribalism got to do with the friction between africans and negroes in the u s i daresay the accusation of wooing the power structure is a little incorrect as a foreigner the african often has to deal with the power structure as it is the word is deal not woo african governments cannot cater in detail to the interests of the negro because the racial problem here like the one in south africa is an internal problem it is useful to note anyway that prior to african independence the u s had no one to answer to for its atrocious racial policies where private individuals are concerned mr williams needs to be reminded that africans do not come here to be absorbed into the negro subculture this is the rude fact as julius nyerere once said we know our friends but it is not up to our friends to pick enemies for us for many negroes this division is often arbitrary and why should i a foreigner lose my head literally and figuratively in the civil_rights fight my calling is elsewhere weve got problems of our own let me just say that as a committee chairman in the notre dame civil_rights  commission it was sometimes my onue to kindle some of your whats happening stalwarts africans do not consider themselves negroes in the american sense of the word in as much as the word means black then we are negro otherwise no for example in hattiesburg miss two years ago a certain gentleman usurped my seat as i stepped down from the bus to take pictures as i tried to reclaim the seat he thumbed me towards the back of the bus he quickly discovered i wasnt a negro now for my credentials i have been here four years i spent the better part of two summers touring the country using the greyhound seeamerica ticket  days of unlimited travel on either occasion i have been in most of the states i have been a door to door salesman currently i work parttime as a bartender at smokes flamingo the best restaurant operated by a negro in south bend in conclusion i am forced to wonder what nigerian taxi drivers custom officers cheap cognac and ginger ale have to do with the point in question the argument begins to get ridiculous with such assertions as who started whom on the road to freedom on the overqualified sociologists it is likely they had nothing we could use nigeria does not have social problems comparable to the u s scale finally to what seems to be the climax of mr williams arguments namely the reason hell i am here why ever in the oh well i already anticipated that question in the january article the actual reason i am classified wise lets here
for more than two centuries prior to the founding of the association for the study of negro life and history the american negro from the point of view of history lived in an era of inhumanity of culture the failure was due to many factors slavery ignorance total disinterest in fact disbelief in the negro as a human being historical distortions and grossly false myths until the th century there were no negro historians of note to avoid the negros total eclipse into inhumanity in  there was born a negro boy in virginia carter g woodson son of slave parents he was unable to attend school regularly and was forced to teach himself while working later he attended high school and college parttime and worked parttime he however was possessed of a brilliant incisive analytical mind he earned his bachelors and masters degrees at the university of chicago and the coveted degree of doctor of philosophy at harvard in  this man dr carter g woodson became americas greatest scholar and authority on the history of the american negro and the contributions of the negro to americas history and progress as well as an authority on the negros african heritage he was a scholar who truly enlarged human understanding dr woodson was a selfless man he devoted his whole life his energies and his material wealth to the lonely search for the truth about the people whom he loved so dearly he had a profound belief that what he found and what he was telling america during his all too short life could only be as effective as the accuracy of the glorious history revealed by him during his nearly  years of painstaking research those scholars who have studied and reviewed more than a score of volumes of his history and his more than  articles on the american negro and the negro of other lands will say that posterity is heavily indebted to dr woodson for the revelations of his impeccable personal research into  years of negro history in september  we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the association for the study of negro life and history the child of the efforts and the brain of this great historian and coincidentally the ninetieth year of his birth this event should be a challenge to every negro to know his own history better and indeed to make it irresistibly attractive and respectable as dr woodson has done we have for many years been involved in the fight against the bigotries and hatreds stirred up in a pluralistic society where the ethnic and religious minorities must fight for a firstclass citizenship which in democratic theory is theirs to the neglect of knowing our own history a fact which gives comfort to the bigots this mistake has been a great loss to us in the lack of knowledge of our race and pride of race we must redress the lack of pride of ancestry too long ignored and thus overcome the deceit of those who would deny us a place in history we must give to the millions of negro children who because of circumstances over which they had no control do not know the chance to emerge from the darkness of ignorance of their own ancestry we must give them the access to history as well as to life which is the heart and soul of the american dream our responsibility is to support in this fiftieth year of our struggle for culture with all our might and means this great association for the study of negro life and history to commemorate the name and memory of a great negro american carter g woodsonand to create a foundation to encourage other woodsons now in our schools or yet unborn to further study the life and history of one of the earliest races to inhabit the american continent the knowledge of the history ot the negro will tear away the many false faces and myths that have so long obscured the truth
this the way it was fnr  j done call thenwhat we guidance and counseling now  down our way someone who saw something in you were a preacher or walked up and asked what you want to be and you told them if you were a girl that you wanted to be a teacher or a nurse if you boy you said a lawyer a a doctor after this you proceededjust proceeded with good fortune i harbored a boon that would insure my choice of vocation in addition to the question i had an older sister who was two grades ahead of me when i reached the fourth grade i began to welcome her intention to learn me the choice assignments that the teachers learned her for instance everyone in the school knew that miss daisy ill call her required the sixth graders to recite i sigh for the land of the cypress and the pine where the jessamine blooms and the gay woodbine instead of reciting a wise saying like good better best during morning devotions i lorded my prestige over the fourth graders by saying all of the cypress and the pine this pattern persisted when i was in the fifth grade my sister had to work the good and bad road problems in the seventh grade i worked them too when i was in the sixth she was in the eighth way on the other side of the track in high school thats when she began stuffing my head with home x she knew how to cream the butter how to make white icing stay on a cake and how to make shredded coconut stay on the white icing so i didnt bat an eye i had no cause to when my seventh grade teacher handed me my promotion card and asked the question i spoke right up and said i want to be a home x school teacher she smiled and patted me on the back being intelligent enough to know i thought that i was more than ready to proceed three months later one nevertobe forgotten september morning in  i left my homeroom class for the home x building but they  didnt have it spelled over the entrance arch the way my sister called it i didnt have time to write down what they had up there because the crowd shoved me along too fast before i could walk independently i was inside a spacious room with scores of sleeksurfaced oblong tables with chairs all around them i had never seen a schoolroom without desks in fact i had never seen a room like this one before we huddled in littlegirl clusters for security while the teacher waved her arms as if she lashed mosquitoes girls girls girls my my she held one side of her face as if she had the toothache sit down at the tables she whisked through the narrow passes between the tables dropping a neat stack of paper slips on each table last name first first name second middle name last we sat there like victims of battle fatigue not rallying at all to what she had just barked out for heavens sake im asking each of you to write your own name cant you do that she sat on the corner of the desk waiting how you want us to write it a girl asked listenno ill write on the board she wrote a name on the board is that your name another girl asked yes the teacher replied and now may i give you the requirements for this course yes maam someone answered she shook her head then told us what to expecta notebook being one of the more important demands she made a smile then read from a small notebook with checkered design food is any substance we sat with undivided attention girls please open your notebooks when i begin dictating again i want you to write it down let me begin again she said food is any substance which when taken into the body is capable of one or more of the following functions first building and repairing tissues i could scarcely hold my peace what was this woman up to i asked myself id wanted to learn more about making good cakes and she stood there all prim and cool and tall laughing with her medium brown eyes and passing her hand over her straightened slick bob never caring at all about creaming the butter thats what i wanted to do thats why i had chosen home x as my vocation building and repairing tissues she had said whod ever heard of food doing that when we ate at home we didnt eat to build or to repair anything we ate to fill our stomachs where had she been where had she come from not to know what food was really for a girl raised her hand breaking the spell what was the last thing that you said she frowned building  building  building  her proud square nose was wrinkling as she spoke if im not mistakenline up come by the desk with an armpit set to meet my nostrils mum is the word they sell it you buy it you use it she sat down for the sniffing exercise never fear my heart whispered as it bumped sounding like raps on a big bass drum you cleaned your body with care and i had i had scrubbed carefully with warm water and octagon soap i had deodorized my armpits with arm and hammer baking soda to be sure i had sprinkled a little between my toes to keep my brown oxfords sanitary on the inside so there had been nothing else that i knew of that a yearold could have done to make herself dainty i marched along hearing my fathers voice and finding comfort in the sound et too brewtay he had told us that that was all a man could say when he found out that his best friend had helped to stab him to death this lady was the one to help me be what i wanted to be already she had become enemy number one there was nothing to say but et too brewtay as my father said when someone he liked pushed him to the wall no one she said after sniffing thirtyfour armpits maybe someone slipped out she counted the slips on the desk yes thirtyfive but dont get happy ill catch her if she stays in this class believe me in the name of health and sanitation i mean for you to look clean be clean and smell clean on and on the password was mum mum was the password as we took notes on food for three weeks as we worked three weeks on our kitchen outfits and as we went to the kitchen to learn to cook cooking was my hope for realizing the joys of home x the kitchen with its peculiarities caused me to wonder if i would succeed after our first briefing for one thing the stove cooked with gas before anyone could ask a question about what the teacher had said she looked at me and said sweetly you light the oven i turned the gas on scratched a match as she had done because the pilot wasnt working and applied it underneath i only lost my eyelashes my eyebrows a halfinch of hair from the line and a week from school to soothe my face from the blown heat with cocoa butter just before the end of the first nineweek period the teacher announced that we would make lemon meringue pies for the superintendent and members of the board of education who always dined in the department of home economics after the official annual meeting a crew of  including the teacher turned out the day before the visit in whitestarched cooking aprons and headbands to make a dozen pies i looked around feeling  pride even joy on being one of this group i stood there dreaming of the beautiful pies wed make get the lemon squeezer dont just stand there get the lemon squeezer i said i mean you jackson the teacher stood akimbo her dark skin darkening even more as i froze i guess you dont know where to find it all right its in the other room thirtyfive pairs of spotlights hit me as i turned to fetch that lemon squeezer once i reached the dining room i sensed relief because a ninthgrader was in there polishing the table wheres the lemon squeezer i asked her lemon squeezer she loudtalked me you tell me girl you dont know a lemon squeezer when you see one the teacher heard her and picked up on the cue ahhah you were going to fool me you dont know what a lemon squeezer is ahhah i cowered in the other room as another member of the cooking class got the lemon squeezer thank you dear she used her best speaking voice girls she continued you ought to pay attention to what your mothers teach you pay attention i had to pay attention and to adhere to my mothers teachings just as she had been taught to obey her mother there had been generations of obedience but neither of our mothers would have recognized a lemon squeezer had it been the size of one of the modern football bowls even though embarrassment stung me regularly because of a previous lack in homemaking knowledge and skills i took home economics for four years learning mostly what negro women on my side of the track couldnt know and though i knew that me and home x had parted company as lifelong mates the very minute i left the other room i have never stopped thinking of the teacher as the emancipator who helped us to become american women

thief drunkard brawler it was the lot of frangois villon fifteenth century french poet to write one of the loveliest evocations of the ubi sunt where are they theme in all poetry in the middle ages with their preoccupation with death this theme was especially frequent and wyndham lewis has called villons ballade of dead ladies one of the master songs of the world with  the exquisite ache of its music caressing and soothing to dreams and its lovely refrain it has recently been translated again by richard wilbur and by galway kinnell but the most familiar version is by dante gabriel rossetti just as the ubi sunt theme was prevalent in the middle ages with their concern for mortality another theme which i may call the hie sum or here i am theme occurs again and again in american negro poetry oppressed ignored and deprecated the negro seeks identity and pride not by regretting or mourning past glories but by bringing them back to the present and identifying them with himself whether or not the poet is conscious of this theme and this tradition it is an understandable psychological reaction to a social situation one of the first and bestknown poems with the hie sum theme is langston hughes the negro speaks of rivers in which the negro invests himself with the dignity and depth of ancient rivers as long as the poets working this tradition bring to it something newminted and unique to themselves it will not become a mere formula like the imitations of villon birth love death are recurrent themes of poetry but the other day i was thumbing through old numbers of the crisis and found a poem using the hie sum theme that was full of cliches the poet called himself crispus attucks and harriet tubman and all the other stock figures clothed in stock language of negro history week the theme of hie sum with its search for identity and pride need not be confined to negro poets we find it in the poem hebrews by samuel oppenheim we discover the hie sum theme even in the work of the jaunty optimistic white american walt whitman but he inverts the material instead of identifying the past with himself he rejects it and claims the present
pancho villa bandit and revolutionary successfully thumbed his nose at a punitive american force led by general john pershing is now subject of a campaign in mexico where he is made out to be more saint than sinner pancho villa is rising in mexico as a sort of mexican legendary robin hood dogooder who never shed blood for pleasure who stole from the rich and befriended the poor whether this version is true or false is something that cannot be verified most of villas contemporaries are dead and in the eyes of a younger generation he is a legendary figure who could have whipped the gringos had he received cooperation instead of persecution from fast tumbling regimes during the turbulent days of the mexican revolution and the legendary figure has a lilting name to go with his exploits pancho villa a name that was not his own for the unimportant doroteo arango raiding and running from the law almost six decades ago in the states of durango sonora and chihauhau was rebaptized by a puerto rican negro an adventurer and guerrilla who fought against the french when maximilian was emperor of mexico the negro francisco villa came into doroteo arangos life when the latter was a fugitive from justice he had killed the seducer of his oldest sister still little more than a child was jailed but managed to escape into the durango hills in the rugged durango fastnesses still inaccessible even in this day arango when not fleeing from the rurales kept himself going by being a cuatrero this is a slang expression of that day meaning nothing more than a cattle rustler the real francisco villa who was an adventurer and professional soldier wound up as a guerrilla fighter in a band captained by a woman the legendary apolinaria garcia dedicated and unyielding in battle against french forces and turncoat mexicans who acknowledged emperor maximilian in the territory of durango zacatecas and chihuahua  mounted at the head of her guerrilla band apolinaria garcia distinguished herself for her courage and audacity in raids against the french she was not always successful but she was a disturbing influence harassing the french invaders in a skirmish at a site known as silita in the state of durango apolinaria garcia was killed and with her death the guerrilla band disbanded soon after with emperor maximilian executed and the mexican republic restored a peace of sorts came to northern mexico francisco villa tried to lead a life of peace tilling the soil but he was not cut out to be a farmer and hearing of the small marauding band of doroteo arango villa abandoned his plow for the gun once more legend has it that after one cattle raid with the bandits spending the fruits on tequila a slightly tipsy francisco villa said i dont like your name it has the ring of a schoolteacher or a respectable man to it you need a more fitting name than the dull even vulgar doroteo arango i know what i will give you my name from now on you are pancho villa  and so it was the negro and the mexican related only by their mutual need for excitement and scorning of the law agreed that pancho villa was a name that had a warriors ring to it even if the warrior was nothing more than a bandit and cattle rustler shortly after this rebaptizing of doroteo arango the bandits were flushed out by rurales and in the running battle that followed the negro francisco villa was slain he never lived to see how the name he had given on a whim gained more and more stature in revolutiontorn mexico substantiating the renaming of arango as the second pancho villa is jose cruz cervantes a grandson of apolinaria garcia who never came to know her because he was a youngster and she was always on the march now living quietly in mexico city with his memories cervantes was one of villas highranking officers from  until the bandit chieftain and revolutionary surrendered to provisional president adolfo de la huerta retired to life of a rancher only to meet death by assassination in a  ambush according to cervantes pancho villa boisterously took on the name from his colored companion in banditry perhaps he had not meant to continue using the name but when the real pancho villa was slain somehow the joke of two pancho villas became a permanent one historians in trying to trace the name have delved into records and come up with fact that doroteo arango was born on june   and they have also followed the theory that the mexican pancho villa got his name from stepfather agustin arango who was the bastard child of augustin villa all this fuss about making pancho respectable and all the bother about a name would have only irritated him said cervantes he was a lusty man and a heavy drinker and he formed a strong attachment to the real puerto rican francisco villa you know how men are in their cups the idea was suggested of a rebaptism and doroteo roared it was a good idea and when the puerto rican was killed he just naturally became pancho to his band somehow those days of fury and bloodshed and frenzied hatreds and barbarous actions seem far away today id like to forget about them but my woundsmy body shows the scars of seven bullet wounds and an equal number caused by knife slasheswont let me forget in the damp weather they act up give me no peace perhaps it is a punishment of sorts i do not know the old man shook his head reflectively why was i saved i was unimportant and fully  of my family including father uncles and other relatives died in revolutionary combat now they say they want to erect statues for pancho villa to commemorate his name i do not know whether this is right or wrong as i do not know if what we did in the bloody years of revolt was right or wrong it was so long ago cervantes who is  said all i want is peace i am an old man now and it all seems so unimportant today although then we thought we were very very important 
negro cowboys
neg roes were pertinent in the old west they helped to open the west and they helped to build the west exploring the western plains and mountains the negroes dug for gold and silver and they trapped wild horses negroes found what is now los angeles they were with the lewis and clark expedition they were in the gold rush and they rode the pony express in the days of the old west negroes acquired the reputation of being outstanding bronco busters but some ranch owners found them too valuable to use in this capacity it was a time in our history says two ucla researchers when a texas rancher might assign a  amonth white cowboy to ride a bucking outlaw horse with the danger of rupture mutilation or death rather than risk the  investment he had in a negro cowboy negroes rode the plains from n v   texas to montana and they were as popular in their day as the legendary figures in movies and television there were negro cowboys like james beckwith who associated with kit carson there was dan diamond who made headlines in the s by participating in a denver county jail break and there was bronco sam who made a bet with other cowboys that he could ride a horse up a flight of stairs these are the facts that were discovered by the ucla researchers philip durham and everett jones when they began gathering material for the negro cowboys dodd mead  it was first durhams idea to write the negro cowboys and for a long time it was just an idea when are you going to write that manuscript on the negro cowboys jones would ask durham and after many months of hearing this question durham replied i will write it if you write it with me so together they began a long two years of research putting together scattered material on negro cowboys they discovered ben hodges a negro cowboy who was known as a competent forger and cattle thief he lived in dodge city during the days of wyatt earp and bat masterson and died there in  once hodges was charged with stealing cattle from a dodge city dairyman and with no friends or lawyer he went to court pleading his own case what me he cried at one point the descendant of old grandees of spain the owner of a land grant in new mexico embracing millions of acres the owner of gold mines villages and towns situated on that grant of whom i am sole owner would steal a miserable miserly lot of old cows at another point he represented himself as a poor but honest cowboy being persecuted by personal enemies and there was deadwood dick who rode and lived in the  black hills of south dakota while a  reward was being offered for his apprehension deadwood dick rode a black horse he wore black clothing and like the equally improbable lone ranger he wore a black halfmask many negro cowboys wore the badge of the law and still others were prosperous bill pickett is the negro cowboy who invented steer wrestling and bob lemmons is still recognized as one of the nations most famous bronco busters bose ikard was a trusted cowhand of rancher charles goodnight when we were on the trail carrying money i gave it to ikard said goodnight a thief would never think of robbing himnever think of looking in a negros bed for money another negro cowboy george mcjunkin is remembered by historians of science for his discovery of ice age bison bones in the folsom new mexico mountain area during the s the negro cowboys is a well researched book written in a noveltext book style it regains an important part of american heritage but this is not a book pleading for the american negroes in this modern day when hollywood has ignored the negro as a western hero durham and jones have written a goethean calling for more light when the west became a myth or a game of lets pretend the negro became the invisible man or at best an uncle tom says durham and jones there was no place for him in these community theatricals he had been a real cowboy but he could not pretend to be a mythical cowboy very little information if any information at all can be found in history text books on negro cowboys and even those that do mention negro cowboys fail to mention the dollar value many ranchers had for these western riders they dont recognize the fact that ben hodges was a real cowboy more real than todays roy rogers and gene autry durham and jones who have written other books have taken on a new significance in telling of the brilliant life of cowboys in the old west it presents a stirring panorama of the old west and lets us live those days again
the roman satirist juvenal once lamented who knows not o volusius of bythinia the sort of monsters egypt in her infatuation worships in its nearly  centuries of existence ancient egypt bowed down to more than  deities often hundreds at a time they ranged in all their horror from hawkheaded horus to the hippopotomusgod apet from sobek the crocodile to the fearsome liongoddess of memphis into this milieu ascended amenhotep iv a strange revolutionary young man who took the throne of pharaoh about  bc in the th dynasty changing his name to akhnaten he condemned the worship of idols and introduced the first form of monotheism then known to the world in akhnaten the rebel pharaoh chilton  author robert silverberg recreates the pharaohs  years of power and ultimate tragic fall akhnatens god was aten symbolized in the sun but actually an archetype of the great abstract deities yet to comethe god of gautama moses jesus and mohammed thou art glittering beautiful strong thy love is great and mighty he has thus been called the first individual known to history but akhnatena physically weak and possibly unbalanced man lacked the true reformers sense of politics monkish fanatical he veered increasingly away from reality and became one of the great tragic kings of history and literature his first major blunder was the promptness with which he expelled amon then the official god of thebes he further alienated the priesthood by imperiously moving his court from the traditional capital to a new city named for him further north along the nile but akhnatens greatest folly was the unworldly indifference with which he watched the egyptian empire the work of three generations of his ancestors and the most extensive then known quickly slip away first the levant under the treacherous hittite ruler suppiluliumas availed itself of egypts internal life then nubia to the south in the end akhnatens godthat strange new god of light and mercydeserted him he became separated from his queen the fabled nefertiti and three years later met his death possibly at the hands of concerned patriots vengeful amonists destroyed his body his city his shrines but perhaps the saddest part of akhnatens story was the popular failure of his ideology a religion without mythology writes the author without images without personified gods with whom a man could identify was able to make no headway in the minds and hearts of egyptians the book is an often engrossing account of this anachronistic pharoah and of the great hamitic dynasty of which he was a part but available evidence concerning his motivations and even the major events of his reign is too sketchy and speculatory to provide convincing reading author silverberg further bogs the reader down in longish excerpts from royal scrolls and tediously detailed hypotheses concerning his downfall still for the layman in any way interested in this fascinating epoch in egypts historyand the history of civilized religionthe book will prove rewardinghamilton bims 
homas b morgan selfcreations  impersonalities holt rinehart and winston  is probably the best writer in the worldat what he does he writes short concise character studies of the subgreat mediocre and notorious in this book gary cooper roy cohn teddy kennedy sammy davis jr elia kazan nelson rockefeller blaze starr david susskind bennett cerf john wayne huntington hartford alf landon and various teenage idols these sketches are crystalsharp no word is out of place there is not a dull sentence in the book morgan knows hes good too otherwise he wouldnt have written a toolengthy introduction explaining how he shadows his subjects with an impersonal eye but it becomes apparent that he is not impersonal that he in fact writes with a cold and merciless irony throughout the book morgan adds little sections on the end of each article describing his own personal relationship with the subject once the subject has seen the usually painful sketch in print the upshot for the reader is a fascinating tale of broken friendships broken because having been seemingly befriended by morgan during the weeks of conversation the subject often feels betrayed when he reads the article and no wonder for morgan an intelligent perceptive man with selfprofessed liberal attitudes cuts the very people to whom one expects him to be kindly and is least disparaging to those whose ideas and deeds he holds in ridicule and contempt he justifies this behavior as sacrifices to his art but if this is art it is morally ambiguous he handles simpleminded right wingers like cooper and wayne easily is vague towards davis their friendship cracks and venomous towards susskind and kazan susskind gave morgan more time and cooperation than any of the others and i sympathize with him when he asks morgan why did you do it to me dont you see what it means youve made it possible for the finks to get me the finks in this case were those who make television a gutless banal dollarsubservient medium and susskind despite his weaknesses was trying to improve the situation susskind was engaged in a significant battle with reallife consequences but morgan was not moved that is the sort of thing that mr morgan a writers writer doesnt seem to understand john woodford
