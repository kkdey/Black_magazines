opposite effects once i used words like blackhearted blacklist black as sin black mark blackball black sheep black market black friday black magic blackmail white mans burden little white lie pure as

reinforcement of your inflated sense of personal worth you called me nigger savage and ridiculed my blackness the fullness of my lips my heritage you stole my food and gave me crumbs you stole my clothes and gave me your leftovers you stole my home and gave me a slum but i forgave your thievery and i thanked you for your gifts not realizing that as you strengthened your foothold on life i

and i pretended insensibility and i forgave you for seeing only a mass of blackness where there actually stood a black person or what remained of a person and i thought look at me look at me why cant you see me but you  turned your back and again i forgave you not knowing that we were on a battlefield with my pride as the victors prize there were no doors for you only open doorways and smiles and greetings and you lapped it up and your ego swelled and you looked at my people and said in disgust they have no pride i looked at my people and i looked in the mirror and i said in shame we have no pride then you smiled and you said im your friend im doing all i can to help you and you shook our hands and addressed us formally and made promises but we said show us and you regarded us with sad eyes hurt eyes and you said you are too suspicious i looked at my people and i looked in the mirror and i said we are too suspicious and i said again and again as time passed we are too suspicious

collective bargaining the key to
a decade ago two groups could be seen marching handinhand in the fight for full equal rights for the negrothe middle class white liberal and the negro civil_rights leader the famous segregated school case provided a microcosm of this community of intereststhe key lawyers were thurgood marshall and robert carter negro and jack greenberg white both black and white social scientists did the background research which helped convince the supreme court to issue its unanimous decision and yet some ten years later the two groups have splitthe negro civil_rights leader bitterly criticizes the middle class white liberal for his hesitance and caution the white liberal stands bewildered attacked by the negro activists the white conservatives and also by his own conscience this conflict stands at the center of much that is wrong with the civil_rights movement in america today for the tragedy is that both sides are right and that a congenial meeting ground has to be reached the main source of the conflict is quite simple the negro argues that he wants his full rights not tomorrow or next week but today since he should have received them yesterday moreover he does not want them as a result of the white mans benevolence but rather because as a human being he deserves them the courts have ruled that he should have them the congress has passed laws asserting these rights and the american conscience demands them the negro correctly questions the morality and the justice of the white community that has taken so long in giving him what should be his since they wont give these rights he will take them and where does the white liberal stand on this issue he too agrees that the negro should have all of the privileges of any other member of the society butand this is crucialthe white liberal in america is basically a pragmatist who believes in certain values and goals but usually feels they take time to be achieved he argues that there should be no poverty today and there is that there should be no threat of war and there is that there should be no prejudice in this world and there is the pragmatic white liberal consequently fights poverty war and prejudice but is under no illusion that these problems can be wiped out today or for that matter tomorrow he hopes to move steadily in the direction of justice but does not expect justice to arrive fully grown immediately and this is his dilemma in dealing with negro rights he does not question that the negro ought to have these rights today that he should have had them yesterday but claims that anyone who argues this way is unrealistic if not irresponsible what must be done is that steps and perhaps the size of the steps and their direction differentiates the white liberal from many white conservatives have to be taken in the direction of full equality but that is all that can be achieved democracy said a famous negro jurist is a state of becoming and to this assertion the white liberal would add his fervent amen and there they stand the two groups who should be working together instead see a widening chasm appearing between them the negro leader shouts bitter epithets and drives for immediate and complete goals the backlash of their drive affects the whites the problem is that both the negro activists and the white pragmatist are right but how to join both approaches is the key tactical issue in the civil_rights struggle one place wherein an answer may be found is in an analysis of amen can history professor howard zinn does this in his interesting article abolitionists and freedom riders the tactics of agitation which appeared in the summer  issue of the columbia university forum he offers the abolitionists as a model for the freedom riders todayas a lesson to be learned from history without challenging zinns evaluation of the contribution the abolitionists made to bringing about the end of slavery the ultimate price paid was a civil war but what was purchased with blood was not even equal rights for the negro as the continuing struggle for civil_rights today indicates the blame for the civil war does not rest on the abolitionists but surely the methods used by both sides offer us no lesson that we can learn from the past except how not to resolve basic conflicts if civil_rights agitators today want to learn any lesson from history  would suggest that they move from the chapter dealing with the abolitionists over to the one dealing with labor history and learn the tactics unions and management have developed to resolve what some observers once thought would be an irreconcilable conflict between two classes labor unions and workers had to suffer many of the same indignities both legal and ideologicalas the negro in the beginning of american history courts found a legal basis for granting unions no rightsarguing that the very fact that workers joined together to seek benefits made the unions a conspiracy and consequently illegal under the common law moreover society developed a rationale to explain why unions and their members were inferior and not to be accorded the same privileges others in society had
first there was the economic rationale if workers joined together to seek higher wages they were violating a dismal law of economicsnamely that workers ought to be paid only enough to subsist if given more they would not really know what to do with it instead they would have more children which would create even greater pressure on a limited sum of money available and this would result in depressions and even worse conditions for the foolish workingmen who did not know their place if this law of economics were not enough darwin provided a biological rationale for fighting unions and for deeming workers inately inferior the socialdarwinists argued that in the struggle for the survival of the fittest obviously those who were at the bottom of the pilenamely workersdeserved to be there while those at the top also merited their exalted level to help the downtrodden either through social welfare assistance or through union activities was to violate a law taken from biology namely the poor who remained poor deserved to remain poor if law economics and biology were not enough to provide an explanation for opposing the rights of unions then religion was called upon judge george baer president of reading railroad in  wrote in response to a request that he help end a strike that the rights and interests of the laboring men will be protected and cared fornot by the labor agitators but by the christian men to whom god in his infinite wisdom has given control of the property interests of this country and thus a large share of american society viewed workers and their unions as inferior beings who would receive benefits only as a result of the largesse of management who in a paternalistic fashion might help their workers these managers felt that they and their workers were a part of one big family with papa management knowing what is best for his boys and girls the workers they pictured the union as the villain or outside agitator who would lead their children from accepting their place in society down the unhappy road toward juvenile delinquency and toward becoming uppity once a union arrived these managers felt that unrest developed a peer group outside the home became more important to the children than the parents the fathers powers were challenged the child began to think his goals were not synonymous with those of the parents he even wanted his allowance raised and perhaps worst of all he wanted to have his voice heard in how the family was run but before the worker could have his voice heard through his unions society and management had to accept the role of labor organizations and this proved not easy rarely would a firms executives initiate the steps necessary for negotiating with their employees leaders instead workers had to lash out at management government and society as being part of a conspiracy to exploit the workers even the relatively conservative american federation of labor included in its preamble to its constitution written in  these bitter words whereas a struggle is going on    between the oppressors and the oppressed of all countries a struggle between the capitalist and the labor which grows in intensity from year to year    unions would therefore adopt such measures and disseminate such principles among the mechanics and laborers of our countries as will permanently unite them but words quickly proved insufficient to turn pious platitudes about workingmens rights into realities and as a result laborers launched demonstrations and these strikes though often peaceful were frequently bitter and bloody the explosion at haymarket square the massed battle at homestead and the mob action against railroads in the pullman dispute are just a few instances of the violence that punctuated labor history as unions sought their rights in our society in doing this they often indiscriminately attacked all police all government all courts and all businessmen but fight they did and eventually win they did for by the mids partially as a result of the backlash caused by the great depression which turned liberals and others against management the people speaking through the wagner act came to accept the fact that unions had a right to exist and that the process they wished to use with management to resolve their disputesnamely collective bargaininghad a legal place in our society and should be protected but the passage of the law did not mean that all firms accepted this new condition for a few years following the passage of the wagner act unions still had to fight for the right to organize and the weapon they frequently used was the sitdown strike and mass demonstrations but unions finally assumed their rightful place in our society and most managers however ruefully came to accept this place as the process of collective bargaining has become increasingly institutionalized the bitter conflict once so common has become far less frequent now responsible union leaders negotiate with responsible management representatives and generally come to terms which both sides will accept conflict still erupts but it most commonly arises now under certain conditions when unionmanagement relations in an industry or area are at an early stage for insecurity breeds violence in industrial relations when unions are democratic and the workers can and do refuse to abide by their leaders recommendations when mistakes in strategy are made when no real collective bargaining takes place because one side or the other believes it knows truth and the other does not when either side is not really negotiating with the other but instead issues statements directed toward its own members or the public and when both sides have stronglyheld opposing philosophical commitments on any issue or issues but even with sources of conflict still present unions and management use a process by which despite its faults they can negotiate their differences problems still remain not all workers have their rights protected some of them have even been taken away by the organization structured to protect themthe unions not all workers receive an adequate income not all workers feel secure in their jobs not all workers have ceased to be degraded by the kind of work they do or by the treatment they receive but a process for resolving conflict for protecting rights for bringing about progress has been evolvednamely collective bargaining and what better alternative has there been offered for resolving civil_rights disputes arguments from analogy are full of perils perhaps their main value is that they provoke thought and surely there are many analogies between the fight by workers for their rights and those by negroes for theirs the workers had to face stern opponents who used legal economic biological religious and paternalistic arguments whose goal was to keep employees in their subservient place so has the negro the workers had to use strikes boycotts demonstrations and violence against those who also used similar tactics against them so has the negro the workers had to face complaints that outside influences were leading them astray so has the negro the workers had to learn to cooperate with nonworkingclass liberals in order to secure their rights so has and must the negro the workers had to reject the ideas of those within and outside the labor movement who tried to subvert the justifiable aspirations of the working class into an instrument for bringing about their own vision of a better worldbe it a return to an imagined better society that presumably existed prior to the industrial revolution or as a stepping stone to a marxist revolution so too must the negro reject the reactionary goals of the black muslims and the revolutionary goals of the various branches of marxism now active in the civil_rights groups the workers had to learn to fight and win prolabor legislation but not think it enough so has and must the negro the workers had also to learn that there is a difference between ultimate goals and immediate realities and that there is a process that permits a somewhat orderly progression by which the gap between goals and realities can be narrowed and that process is collective bargaining so must the negro learn this lesson and this is the most difficult lesson to ask him to study for it requires him to accept less than he merits and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the lesson must also be learned by the white community for negotiating means that at least two sides have to be ready to sit down to talk and to act so far the whites have been much slower than negroes in their willingness to discuss their differences but regardless of what the white appears ready to do the negro has to differentiate between minimum and maximum goals to demand the latter and accept no less than the formerfor example in education all negroes ought to have the opportunity for a completely unsegregated education in fact society in order to compensate for the culturally deprived background of many of the negro children ought to be spending more money on their education than they are on the white children but how does one immediately end segregated education for example in new york city the answer is one cannot one can only move in that direction  what does this entail on the part of the negro civil_rights groups since the white community has moved tragically slow when at all it means that the negro groups have to place pressure on the white leadership to sit down and negotiate steps that will lessen segregation as well as improve the educational level of those schools that are and will continue to be predominantly negro for some time to come this entails negotiations that result in an agreement a contract to use unionmanagement terminology that would last for a period so that the education of the children can proceed without the turmoil that has so far often hindered rather than helped the students by this i do not mean that the negro community should accept these terms as final but merely as a meaningful compromise until the next negotiation when increased demands must be made and a still better settlement achieved let us take another exampleemployment the negro unemployment rate is shockingly twice that of the white which also is too high how do we solve this immediately we cannot to say we can is unrealistic and ridiculous even if as a matter of policy firms decide to hire more negroes than whites to compensate for past ill treatment the unhappy fact is that the negro is still inadequately trained for the kinds of jobs that are available consequently instead of demanding that the pie in the sky should be eaten today negro civil_rights groups should pressure management and unions to agree to open doors for negroes for jobs that communities including schools unions firms and all levels of government develop training programs which will teach negroes specific job skills adaptable skills and job responsibility and that the negro community sponsor more of these programs on their own all of these demands require negotiation by responsible leaders capable of coming to decisions that will hold for a while and permit some progress to be made thus what is needed is some process by which groups can negotiate their differences and convince their followers that the compromises accepted are important worthwhile and steps in the proper direction what this means is that on all levels negro and white leadership must be able to sit down and communicate with each other and make some resolution of their differences that will be accepted by both sides for a given period this does not mean that the negro groups should stop talking about maximum demands in collective bargaining one does not start ones negotiations with the minimum one wants but the negro leaders have to be ready to accept less and sell this acceptance in their communities they may be called uncle toms as a result all union leaders at one time or another have been charged with selling out to management and some have but as long as these leaders feel that what they have gained is the best that can be achieved at that time and place and that they have made a major step forward then it is their responsibility to accept the epithets of their followers even though i doubt if they will receive as many as some fear at times these settlements will be rejected for good or bad reasons but this is true of all settlements the fact is that one of the major frustrations facing the negro masses is the lack of progress the lack of settlements the lack of real leadership white or negrowith some notable exceptions some orderly procedure resulting in progress is essential to lessen the justifiable distress within the negro community for rising expectations without any way of really knowing whether these expectations can ever be achieved or without learning what progress has actually been accomplished can only result in frustration that explodes into violence and the resulting insecurity also partially explains the backlash among the whites since they too do not know what is going on but are frightened by the fact that they wander between two worlds one dead the other powerless to be born but a procedure has to be evolved by which the old world that is dead can be buried and that a new world can become mature enough to be born and grow and to secure this negotiating procedure the civil_rights groups have to fight with all their might as this is the one issue concerning which there can be no compromise for it is both the minimum and the maximum the labor movement recognized a similar issue as basic and would not give in concerning it as a result unions fought hard resolutely and met violence with violence for the right to organize to form a union and why not to bring about a marxist society not to bring about land reform and cooperatives but so that their leaders could be recognized as their spokesman and speak collectively for them with management and the government and negotiate terms that would result in improvement of their lot they would accept no less management did not willingly give them this right labor had to fight for iton picket lines and in legislative halls and in this fight they generally had the support of the liberals this too is the main fight that the negro has to wage today he has to demand of the white leadership in every community on every school board in every firm in every union that it be ready to sit down with the negro leaders and negotiate conditions that will bring the negro closer to the full and equal citizenship that he demands and is justifiably his right and these negotiations should not be buried in the human relations committees springing up in numerous communities with power to do naught but advise because consent to the status quo is all they normally do the whites have to represent the white power structure the negro his power structure with some inevitable jurisdictional disputes  it would be nice if there were no such differentiated structure but it is a fact that there is to argue for example that the white leaders at this time in history have the interests of all citizens at heart is as nonsensical as the statement that management has the interests of its workers at heart the latter is at best partially true in that many managers do concern themselves with their workers welfare but the executives main responsibility is with other problems and issues similarly the white leader may wish to help his fellow negro citizens but he too has other problems and other interest groups to which he feels responsible these interfere with his often seeing eyetoeye with negroes concerning how to resolve difficulties to argue further that such a collective bargaining structure would inevitably remain with us forever and consequently we will never be able to rid ourselves of the problem because each side will continue to make demands regardless of the need is like saying we ought not to have nations today because if sometime in the future we have world government and with it peace and understanding nations will not be necessaryin fact may provoke problems both arguments are at best utopian and at worst are rationalizations for inactivity moreover the history of collective bargaining indicates another alternativenamely that labor and managements goals and practices will become more and more alike as they have and that bargaining will not be an instrument of conflict but one of cooperation this too could be the final result of negrowhite bargaining until then however people with power have to negotiate with people with power people with responsibility and a willingness to take the lead the credit and the blame have to deal with people having similar characteristics both sides have to be willing to come to terms imperfect terms to be sure and sell these settlements to those whom they represent that sometimes they will fail in this task and conflict may result is inevitable and justifiable for such a procedure will in the long run not end disputes but rather reduce the number of intense conflicts after all for a while this will be a new process in which both sides will be insecure the masses may not agree with the settlement for good or bad reasons there will be mistakes in strategy one side or the other may really fail to bargain and each side may be bitterly and philosophically opposed to the position the other side takes but as we have already discussed this is still true in collective bargaining between labor and management today and yet the process of bargaining does result in major benefits to workers and is one method of institutionalizing and resolving disputes  and as collective bargaining is only one course by which employees try to make advances and to settle their problems for example negotiations can only cushion the impact of technological change they cannot solve it so the civil_rights groups have to fight other battles elsewhere in legislative halls and in the courts as examples but collective bargaining between negro and white leadership would permit the stepbystep peaceful progress so necessary today if both groups are not to be so estranged that even if the negroes achieve all the rights they merit the chasm between the groups would be so great and the hatred so intense that progress will have poverty in intergroup relations as its handmaiden and from where will these negro leaders come in some instances the white community must seek them out in others they will arise themselves as they have in the past out of the already active civil_rights organizations the negro churches the labor unions the industrial firms the schools youth groups and the local communities the real problem has been that the negro leader has been unable to point to many concessions or improvements for which he could claim credit and thereby secure the support of the negro community one reason for reverend martin_luther_kings power among the negroes in the south has been that he could point to the role he and his organization have played in securing progress for he has indeed often bargained successfully one negro intellectual pointed to this dilemma when he charged that the  riots ought to be part of the message to the white power structure the white power structure itself diminished the influence of the negro leaders by refusing to make the necessary concessions to them    this is a must for negroes if they are to retain their influence otherwise the masses of negroes will rise up in disgust and frustration and follow those negro leaders among the black muslims and elsewhere who so accurately reflect this disgust and frustration and offer such simple answers to such complex problems to blame and hate all whites for ones inadequacies and problems is as simple an explanation as to blame and hate all negroes the answer we are proposing is less simple and less satisfying to ask the negro to fight for evolving rather than complete solutions for becoming rather than arriving is not easyparticularly when suggested by white liberals who do not have the problem to solve but the white liberal must strive along with or as a part of the negro civil_rights groups to force the white leaders to be ready to negotiate and to make worthwhile settlements he must do this otherwise the white liberals argument that complete justice will not come to the negro today or as a result or immediate or unrealistic demands becomes only an excuse for inaction an apology for delaythus to bring tomorrow closer to today requires the acceptance by whites and negroes of some procedure like collective bargaining by which differences can be settled and progress made otherwise the sun will stand still in the heaven while both sides struggle below tomorrow will take longer in coming and the price we will pay for this delay is obvious all around us
listen know old dear i youve been working for whitey the liberal for five long years now and have only received one  raise at the time of the fare hike last year but you mustnt be too discouraged and you did right to tell him go fly a kite with your stingy raise busterbehind his back of course because you couldnt very well refuse the damn thing unless you had some other better place to go to and besides that fare boost had sorta put a crimp in your budget remember but what im really wanting to say is this that here in our affluent society which has an antipoverty war going full blast on paper you simply cant afford to get too uppity because youve got to remember your place in fact being black and female youve got two places to remember one lower than the other if you can possibly get that far down which is why so many of yall walk around all bent over i guess youve been so low so long so you see when you hear the liberal and miss ann telling people why some of our best friends are colored and you know theyre talking about you you ought not to let it get your goat much yes i know youre one of the most overworked characters in history overworked and underpaid too and i know that every time you pick up a book magazine or playbill theres sure to be at least one little thing about the negro maid but really old dear you must learn to bear fame with grace then when the liberal is entertaining the press and he casually mentions his wife whos out cooking the dinner and you who are out bedding down the brats and his filipino man who is out fixing the drinks and then just to demonstrate his wry humor he tells a little story concerning the shoeshine boy who in real life is your yearold husband dont you look mad when you bring the er little darlings in to say good night you smile er i guess grinning is more in tradition that way you just might get one more of them  pay raises and then too if you keep the liberal feeling good hes going to go easy on miss ann and she just might give you one more of them dresses of hers i mean they look real nice on you even if you do sorta hafta add a little piece in the side after all if you hold your arm just so nobody can ever tell the difference but to get back to my point and your two places here in our great society which have given rise to the theory that you meaning all yall should be a sort of spiritual sponge for your husband yes thats right they mean punching bag now what im trying to point out to you is this dont you pay that crap no attention when you come home at  at night after being on your poor aching feet practically since  that morning and racing round like crazy because miss ann imprisoned in her own place which is under the liberals big foot is most certainly going to keep you reminded that you are under her foot and she gets every pennys worth out of you every day you are ready to hit the sack so when you get home and there sits your husband who tells you hes hungry and if you dont hurry up and fix him something to eat hes gonna go up side your head him whos been warming a chair bottom all day only shining a shoe now and then except for that brief moment around noon when he hopped up there and cut them few steps when the liberal flipped him that quarter tip he is going to sit there while you make a hour day well listen old girl you just march on out there to that kitchen and fix yourself a big pot of steaming hot watery grits taking your own sweet time of course and when he comes out there to give you whatfor you let go with them grits and then start working out with that pot believe me old dear you wont hear no more about him going up side your head not ever again and oh yes should the opportunity ever present itself dump some of them grits on old youknowwho will you
the loveliest day
before i got to be such a sharp and wise fellow of about  or  i used to visit with my grandfather on his farm every summer we had some pretty good times together and i miss it all but most of all i miss an inner quality of myself thats gone forever but its nothing new its an old story out of a new time i dont know exactly why im telling it and i dont know why you may listen but ill tell it and i hope youll listen as we did every morning on this particular morning we were up before sunrise milking the cows and feeding the animals while my grandmother cooked breakfast when we finished with this work we went in and ate and all during breakfast i kept looking at the rifle  that leaned in the corner and caught a straight line of sunlight on the dark blue barrel after breakfast we were going squirrel hunting we had planned it and talked about it as we cut the weeds out of the young cotton and during the two or three days we spent thinning the corn it was an event that we had looked forward to like having ice cream sometimes on sundays after dinner well boy we go see what you can do today he was looking at me smiling and i smiled back and waited with a deep anticipation he was a tall dark man with big shoulders and gray closely cropped hair something in his face was strong and stern but his brown eyes were soft and loving and i respected him and loved him after eating we put the saddle on his horse there was only one saddle i rode bareback my grandmother fixed us a lunch and put it in a flour sack which was hung over the saddle horn and in the cool earliness of the morning we rode off down the road about eight oclock the sun was getting hot but we rode in the shade of the trees that branched out over the road and so it wasnt so hot i looked back and could see our tracks fade out in the red dust behind us my grandfather rode in front and i watched his back and listened to the squeak of the saddle as we went along finally we turned off the road  and went into the woods and high above the tall tree tops against a spot of blue sky i could see a strong black bird circling at a tremendous altitude when that passed there were only the green tree tops and the blue sky on the side of a hill that overlooked a misty river bottom we came upon a cluster of old trees that were mingled with large dead and live limbs there were about four or five squirrels playing on the branches we slid down from our horses and walked slowly and as quietly as we could up to the trees we took aim and fired at the same time two fell the others ran into the hollows and cracks in the trees now we had to wait for them to come out we sat with our backs against an old log without saying anything and there were only the sounds of the woods the singing of birds and locusts sounding out clear against the green hot quietness the time seemed to dream away and we waited but the squirrels didnt come out but still we waited and watched the trees and looked out over the river bottom that lay beneath us in a humid hot mist and a wide cluster of dark green tree tops the sun got higher and hotter then one came out we looked at each other and silently decided that i take him i put my sights on him and eased in on the trigger and watched him fall against the ground and then the wait began again after the sixth one it was decided that that was enough it was almost midafternoon and we started back home by another way when we came to a running stream just off the road we had a cool drink and ate our lunch the cold buttered biscuits with the scrambled eggs and ham tasted very good when we finished we just sat there saying very little and watching the water go by four white people drove down the road at first only one of them saw us then they all turned and looked i thought nothing about them they were gone from my mind as fast as the car was gone from my sight we skinned and cleaned the squirrels and rinsed them off in the stream and went on up the road to where it crossed the main highway there was a store there and the white man who ran it asked me if i was a pretty good shot i said i was and he offered to give me a bottle of soda water what kind do you wanta red and i said that was the kind i wanted because that was the kind i wanted at that moment and that was all that mattered to me outside my grandfather talked to some people that we knew and i sat on the running board of their old pickup truck with my old straw hat pushed back on my head and drank my soda water and watched the cars go down the highway i felt fine sitting there in the afternoon shade with a nice cool drink and hearing the voices of the old people as they talked it was a lovely day one of the loveliest ive ever had but as the years have gone by ive learned new things such as a red bottle of soda water is a joke that theres a difference between white people and black people other than the color i learned about lynchings and a lot of other things now theres a second thought about anything red when white people look at me suspiciously they hang in my mind long after they are gone sometimes and now i wonder about the importance of a lot of things that i didnt even bother about at first that arent even important and i know it but they worry me a little sometimes i told this to a modem and educated young man one day and he said ignorance is bliss i think not i said ignorance is hell i knew what he meant but he didnt know what i meant and i didnt want the essential part of a real but dreamlike day to be equated to ignorance
what does is mean to be  txt  an egg what is it l w lik£tthese are questions which i am never asked at cocktail parties or in polite company nice people simply do not just walk up to one and ask these questions they are burdened by the fear of offending they would be stigmatized by the wellknown dictum that to ask such questions immediately differentiates the egg from other people they really dont care because they themselves will never have to experience being an egg and in fact they do not wish such an experience to be aware of what its like might cause them to suffer the experience and might cause them to be notsonice people in addition in order to maintain the standards of todays cocktailparty sophistication it is essential to pretend under any circumstances that one already knows all about such things and has no need to ask questions finally i am never invited to cocktail parties if i am present it is not as a guest but as an entertainer and i am purchased not present socially who does ask these questions well some people dothe sociologists for example not all sociologists but only those specializing in the field they come around with pads of paper and pencils and ask a multitude of questions of a crosssection of eggs they then publish a crosssection of the answers in little scholarly journals which may be read by a crosssection of the sociologicallyoriented public but which are more usually read by a crosssection of fellow sociologists specializing in the same field my own uninformed opinion is that such studies do not quite serve the purpose of familiarizing the general public with the real lifestruggle which faces every egg from birth to death psychiatrists ask these questions at least my psychiatrist does he probably knows more about my life than i do because he knows how to interpret my overt thoughts and actions and to discover the subliminal truths which cause me to think and act as i do but then he is also an egg and whatever i communicate to himwhether consciously or unconsciouslyis a professional secret i have been asked such questions by noneggs who are interested in our cause but these are few and far between and they are always marginal noneggs who do not belong to polite society and cannot communicate their knowledge to any but other eggs and equally marginal noneggs then again except in very rare circumstances they also suffer from the fear of offending and differentiating the egg from themselves they are determined to prove that eggs and noneggs are basically the same there are i suppose others who would ask the questions but i have never encountered them so much for that i am avoiding the point of this paper which is to describe just what it does mean to be an egg well to begin with you are born you emerge from the womb and are exposed to life for a while you are coddledim sorry you are cradled and fondled and treated with love and affection by your mother but soon you have to make your own way and thats where the trouble starts you have to make a living somehow so you set out with great ambitions and dreams you have ideals you of all other eggs whove ever lived are going to become somebody you look around you and see your friends having the same ambitions and dreams and ideals surely such a mass of idealists will change the course of history and you will march forward unspoiled towards achievement what happens you have to make a choice you have to choose a way of living and the sad thing is that your choice is not free in spite of what the constitution says you cannot choose to become director of a large company or even plan on aiming someday to be director unless its your own company or one owned by another egg you cannot expect to become president of the country so you give up that dream you cannot really get anywhere in the nonegg world because noneggs represent the majority and you can be so easily crushed broken drained so you look around at whats left open to you you see other eggs going out and you see them regimented boxed sold beaten whipped fried scrambled boiled poached and powdered some achieve a certain distinction but always at the cost of their own personalities the majority are simply cookeddevoured by unthinking noneggs who couldnt care less find me the nonegg who pities or sympathizes with us other than those marginal noneggs previously mentioned and ill show you a saint noneggs do not mind killing us because for them we are not human what else can we do we can degrade ourselves by playing the fool and allowing ourselves to be ridiculously dressed as party favors and easter eggs we are never asked about our own religious preferences we can become the momentary attraction by being rolled roughly across lawns or carried on spoons but again the only outcome of these occupations is tragedy none of us has ever survived such an ordeal in one piece in the end we are a lost race there is not much more to be said we have tried to be patient we have endured torture and ridicule without protest some of us have avoided being broken by the noneggs but not many and of these who have done so most have in the end relinquished their dignity and become rotten adding their foul odor to the stench exuded by all hypocritical noneggs we must resist but we must do so proudly there resides within each and every one of us a rich untapped reservoir of strength the core of our salvation lies within each of us as an individual we can only help ourselves by developing that strength to its utmost by working and striving to become strong tough and rocklike we must take the line of most resistance not the compromising approach which leads to the degeneration and decay of ones internal spirit we must in the final analysis face up to the choice and decide just where and how we are going to overcome thus i urge every egg young and old alike to take up the rallying cry petrify not putrefy

there are a lot of people who feel that the fact that jews have suffered their own kind of suppression and subjugation automatically qualifies them to understand just how the african or the negro feels in a similar situation this is only true to a limited extentcertainly not to the extent that we are led to believe in reading froma sands my son africa sherbourne press  in my son africa the author goes to some pains to prepare the reader to accept the fact that as a jewish woman the principal character can fully identify with and understand the rejection pain and special panic of the south african blacks she befriends in attempting to pull this off she relates experiences of her jewish parents and the nazis that there are similarities cannot realistically be denied but they are not exact parallels to the situation facing the black african in south africa in south africa the black african is the majority who is subjugated by a white minority on his own land the horrors that the jews have suffered over the years have been numerous all too numerous but the most heinous crimes have happened in countries to which they have migrated however the african is bullied by migrants to his lands there are perhaps arguments to demonstrate that this is a minor difference but it is a difference and coupled with other differences of degree it makes a rather strong case against part of the authors basic thesis in this book despite w hat controversy the basic tenets may bring on i think there will be less objection to the style of the author her story is rather easily and fastmovingly told in many respects the hand of a woman is very evident in the style but like most good women writers the author escapes the fatal fault of being too feminine in her handling of her effort the book has certain elements of sex violence racism and excitement that are very professionally mixed and strategically deployed to keep the reader interested and entertained the reader comes away with the feeling that he might have been the willing subject of a kind of literary shell game the crucial and central point is that the reader willingly participated and perhaps that is why  recommend the book despite some basic uncertainties i still hold for it brooks johnson
the one hundredth anniversary issue of the nation  is a rich incomparable collection of essays by distinguished american writers and it is worth buying and treasuring for its breadth and depth of concern with those subjects and those problems which exercise the liberal conscience but if not for these reasons this handsome sleek page edition of the famous old weekly is worth buying because of the revelation it offers of the low point to which a great american negro writer can stoop in an effort to justify his posture of aloofness from the negro struggle ralph ellison one of the ablest writers in the world today wastes his enormous talent and energy on a silly apology for his not having spoken out in behalf of the black revolution in almost eight pages in a piece called tell it like it is baby mr ellison succeeds in saying only what he might have said more fruitfully and more simply in a paragraph his message is that the whole racial problem in this country is so complex that he being a sensible and cautious man lacks the audacity to attempt to state what he believes to be its essence thus he continues his subtle aboveitall warfare with those writerswhite and blackwho are engaged in the struggle against racist evil and mr ellisons ridiculous piece should be compared with the lucid human moving article by george w broadfield a different drum describing how this brilliant and highly talented man he designed the first domestic peace corps found his way back from a bitter alienation spawned by the very racism mr ellison pretends he cannot judge it is worth spending  to read and compare the two articles but of course there is so much more the authors represented here include howard zinn dan wakefield harvey swados c vann woodward alfred kazin harold clurman and robert alan aurthur among some  altogether sometime negro digest contributor john oliver killens black mans burden is represented by a provocative piece of filmland called hollywood in black and white for this special issue the regular editor carey mcwilliams turned over the chair to david boroff who died last may before the special issue was wrapped up the magazine stands as a fine memorial to mr boroffhwf 
the civil_rights issue is the most significant moral crisis in the history of our country it is a national problem in some respects more crucial to every american than the implications of the bomb in recent weeks the problem exploded in our faces the fact that congress has passed the civil_rights act is not enough each individual must pass his own bill within his heart we are all aware of this whether in a vague sense or with complete consciousness of it the recent outbursts of emotion even in the enlightened liberal north have made this woefully apparent still most americans look at the south and its people as the sole violators of human justice william faulkner was a southerner who happened to be a writer to imply the reverse would be erroneous because the mans writing became what it did because of his background and birthright not in spite of it his life was begun mostly spent and concluded in mississippi a part of the world that is no loneer so much a state of the union so much as it is an emotional idea a symbol of intolerance and social backwardness it is one of the last strongholds of southern resistance to a heterogeneous and assimilated society mississippis dilemma was faulkners dilemma and bill faulkner wrote with an honesty and penetration into his own mixed feelings that few contemporary novelists have equalled there are two critical approaches to such an authors work the social and moral implications contained within or the purely artistic the ageold question of whether or not the writer successfully achieved his object since faulkner was a moralist who felt a compelling need to resolve the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself we should perhaps concentrate on the former consideration in his entire literary career faulkner wrote  novels and  short stories the vast majority of his writing dealt with the problems of the south not just the racial problem but with the entire social structure that was and still is founded upon memories of precivil war agrarian days and was beginning to crumble in the face of a new increasingly urban and industrialized socioeconomic scheme he embodied the entire deep south within his wonderful and terrible yoknapatawpha county which he created out of his mind and experience and committed to paper his characters lived in yoknapatawpha county they never stepped outside its boundaries except to go to war or to nearby memphis for a big weekend yoknapatawpha is the deep south as faulkner knew it likely enough he knew it better than most as his work when conceived as a whole shows that he never stopped thinking about it the sound and the fury deals with the compson family and their moral destruction the dilemma is centered in jason who despises negroes yet allows himself to be directed by dilsey the housekeeper who has become a mainstay over a period of many years with the compsons jason wants desperately to restore the family to its original status but feels everyone is thwarting his efforts to achieve this goal them new york jews back east are responsible for his poor investments in the cotton market and his kitchen full of niggers forces him to work in a general store so that he can feed them jason does not recognize his own cruelty and depravity he is so smallminded that he is incapable of selfrecognition intruder in the dust contains faulkners strongest statement concerning the negroes and the southern position relating to them lucas beauchamp a thoroughly unlikable and highly admirable negro is about to be lynched for the shooting of a white man a crime that everyone knows he did not really commit despite the circumstantial evidence that exists lucas is an inflexible obstinate individual who refuses to be what his white neighbors want him to be he neither defies nor compromises his composure and dignity infuriate the white citizens of yoknapatawpha county every white man in that whole section of the country had been thinking about him for years we got to make him a nigger first hes got to admit hes a nigger then maybe we will accept him as he seems to intend to be accepted in essence lucass behavior does not in any way reenforce the stereotype on the contrary it contradicts it and fans the flames of guilt lucas is able to endure even in mississippi where he is not only an object of hatred but one of guilt faulkner shows immense admiration for the negros ability to endure and survive the injustices inflicted upon him so mercilessly he is also careful to emphasize the sense of guilt and shame that lies deeply buried in the white southern conscience this is a major part of the dilemma perhaps the essence of it as we see it recorded almost daily in the press the white southerner who deems himself a practicing american and yet does everything in his power to prevent the negroes in his community from exercising their rightsin short from being themselves practicing americansis another illustration of guilt it is a clearcut seemingly impossibletoresolve conflict between reality and dreamthe reality being that negroes as american citizens should vote and the dream of course is the fondly clenched myth of the negros inferiority a myth that proves to be just a little more so with each passing day it is this type of conflict that lucas represents to the white community pragmatic evidence clearly points out that he could not have murdered the man but it would be a relief to see him proven guilty and hanged as it would prove that the negro who refused to follow the stereotype who insisted upon his individuality as a human being was in essence a nigger the negro strength is a primary theme in faulkners writing and should not be overlooked at any time although the sound and the fury was written in  faulkner added an appendix to the novel during the late s at the publishers request this addition introduces the members of the compson family from their beginnings in the eighteenth century to the year  the reader sees a pattern of progressive deterioration within the family alcoholism insanity incest and crumbling moral strength reduces them to their woeful status at the beginning of the novel the last characters to be outlined are the negro servants  luster a man aged  who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice his age and three times his size but could keep him entertained dilsey they endured the preceding comment makes faulkners respect fairly obvious it is interesting too that the appendix was written so many years after the body of the novel within the book dilsey is certainly the most forceful character the guiding force who keeps the compsons living from day to day in faulkners mind these negroes did endure the appendix is a monument to those negroes who  years later were objects of his respect and admiration it is conceivable that he returned to his novel and discovered a striking parallel between dilsey and countless negroes in and around oxford the writers home the appendix then became an amen to his original observation of dilsey and the negroes of oxford mississippi the negro strength is portrayed even more vividly in intruder in the dust by lucas beauchamp who serves as a reminder and example to everyone especially the whites sambo will suffer it of course there are not enough of him yet to do anything else and he will endure it absorb it and survive it because he is sambo and has that capacity to endure and survive but he will not be thrown back decades and what he survives to may not be worth having because by that time divided we may have lost america faulkner shared the dilemma experienced by many southerners the attempt to defend the ideology and ritual of inequality and separation of the races which is rubbed raw by the conscience that knows this defense is inherently wrong the result is a deep sense of guilt shared by enough individual southerners to be considered collective psychologists argue that people conceal their guilt feelings through acts of compensation the most apparent compensation in the south is perhaps the almost blatant southern hospitality and the compulsive need to boast about it this is not a thorough psychological analysis but the concept is sufficient for an insight into faulkners writing william faulkner the writer constantly fought those tangled feelings within the heart of bill faulkner the mississippian like most southerners he gloried in the past the legends and myths of the old south meant a great deal to him the past was also his source of guilt slavery lynching and violence are all a part of the past that the southerner both longs after and tries to evade these factors constitute the southern dilemma that faulkner so desperately tried to portray in his writing it is because he was a southerner first and a writer second that he spoke so eloquently for his people even those who attacked him as a nigger lover he held a strong conviction that the south could and should solve her own problems concerning racial tensions thats why we must resist the north not just to preserve ourselves nor even the two of us as one to remain one nation because that will be the inescapable byproduct of what we will preserve which is the very thing that three generations ago we lost a bloody war in our own backyards so that it remain intact the postulate that sambo is a human being living in a free country and hence must be free thats what we are really defending the privilege of setting him free ourselves which we will have to do for the reason that nobody else can since going on a century agothe north tried it and failed so it will have to be us soon now this sort of thing the possibility that lucas beauchamp will be lynched wont even threaten anymore it shouldnt now it should never have this presents a lucid insight into the white southern position we can see that the southerner knows that his society is warped and functioning out of joint we can see that faulkner is brutally aware of the dilemma for he does share it with his fellow citizens like all southerners he was a product of his segregationoriented environment it would be a romantic falsehood to assume that bill faulkner did not have at least a particle of jason compson in himself how much we will never know  and then a yankee will talk your head off about niggers getting ahead get them ahead what i say get them so far ahead you cant find one south of louisville with a blood hound because when i told him uncle job the negro handyman about how theyd pick up saturday night and carry off at least a thousand dollars out of the country he says dont begrudge um i can sho afford my two bits  two bits hell i says that dont begin it how about the dime or fifteen cents youll spend for a damn two cent box of candy or something how about the time youre wasting right now listening to the band dats de troof he says well ef i lives twell night hits gwine to be two bits mo dey takin out of town dats sho then youre a fool i says well he says i dont spute dat neither ef dat was a crime all chain gangs wouldnt be black  jason of course merely concludes that negroes are worthless and that northerners do not know the black man as intimately as southerners who by and large claim to know those people part of the vast defense mechanism built to support the whites behavior and actions faulkner is careful to inject his opinion in the ironic remark of uncle job there would indeed be plenty of whites breaking rock if being a fool were a crime faulkners inner belief in the equality of the negro never completely asserts itself he states his belief in equality but continuously resorts to white southern platitudes in an attempt to give valid reasons for the racial injustices that occur in mississippi his attempt to reconcile his attitudes is admirable however it is this very attempt that made him the artist that he was his effort to understand the negro as a human being was a lifelong struggle as an outsider he could only walk around the negro mind and catch an occasional glimpse into it we can detect this effort in the portrayal of lucas beauchamp who out of necessity has built a wall around his true feelings lucas is neither defiant nor obsequious he is not arrogant at all and not even scornful just intolerant inflexible and composed faulkner strove desperately to come to grips with his dilemma he knew that the negro was equally entitled to freedom and justice but william faulkner the writer was after all bill faulkner from mississippi the dilemma can be traced not only through history and contemporary events but through literature mark twain portrayed it vividly in huckleberry finn in this novel we see jim the runaway slave and huck as friends both of whom are running away from civilization yet huck cannot rid his mind of the idea that jims blackness marks him as inferior after playing a cruel trick on jim huck feels that as a friend he must apologize then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without saying anything but that was enough it made me feel so mean i could almost kissed his foot to take it back it was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humble myself to a niggerbut  done it and warnt ever sorry for it afterwards neither both twain and faulkner knew that the idea of negroes being subservient was completely wrong although twains preoccupation with race was far less severe than that of the latter faulkner as far as can be told was aware that the negro was equal and should be treated as such the statements made in intruder in the dust would certainly indicate this however his characters are not able to reject the idea that negroes should know their place if he would just be a nigger first just for one second one little infinitesimal second these words are spoken by yearold chick mallison whom faulkner places in much the same position in which twain places huck both boys must struggle with their consciences both boys are violating the mores of their society in attempting to help a negro it is impossible to credit faulkner with a final solution to his dilemma he never arrived at one as a southerner he had a strong pride in his birthright an awesome feeling for the land the crops the woods the nearby delta region and the tense silence that the smalltown and rural southerner feels in a way that few other americans do he also felt the dark shameful side of his heritage that produces a builtin sense of inferiority in so many southerners as a writer he not only shared these feelings with his fellow mississippians but probably felt them even more intensely a recent article in time magazine which used faulkner for its cover stated his dilemma with wonderful clarity for him the crime of the south was chattel slavery and the white mans denial of the negros equal humanity was an ineradicable curse on the land and its people ever since faulkner argues the white southerner has been burdened by a crippling unacknowledged guilt as intimate and inescapable as if taken in with the milk of his motheror of the negro wet nurse intruder in the dust indicates that the negro is a living breathing reminder of the white mans guilt lucas beauchamp becomes the symbol of the guilt that all white men feel when they look upon him or any negro lucas beauchamp once the slave of any white man within range whose notice he happened to come now tyrant over the whole countrys white conscience no writer in our time knew the south and wrote about it as vividly and as searchingly as william faulkner he never solved his own conflict any more than the south has of now perhaps his insight and honesty can be summed up by another statement from the time magazine article he desperately urged his fellow southernersand himselfa change of heart he never on the evidence quite managed that change himself but if he left a message and a legacy it was to urge upon his fellow southerners and the nation the imperative necessity for that change william faulkner is no longer in this world in the physical sense of the meaning of life but his writing lives on and will no doubt survive as long as literature exists as a valuable part of mans cultural and emotional experience now perhaps more than ever before his novels and short stories take on their true meaning and stand apart from all others in their honesty and their urgency the man is dead the dilemma is still very much in the minds of men and for this reason above all others perhaps we should all read or reread william faulkners wordsand take them to heart 
the world of jazz has long been racially the most completely t  integrated segment of american society the beat move ment taking its cue from the jazz world in this as in many e other respects is likewise racially integrated from the enc j aves of the sexual underground it is no exaggeration to refer to this influence as the negrification of american morals the american negro was for  years or more proselytized by the christian churches particularly by the protestants in the south where the negro was in chattel slavery for all but the last  years of that time the preachers performed the role assigned to them by the slaveholders to keep the negroes in a state of chattel slavery to convince them that this was the status allotted to them in holy scripture that the slaveholders were their divinely appointed masters and that any revolt or even secret grumbling was a sin against god and his dearly beloved son jesus christ along with these preachments went the whole bag and baggage of the judeochristian moral code and the negroes were warned on pain of eternal damnation to a hell of fire and brimstone and unending tortures to observe the moral code of christianity and forget their tribal sexways to this end families were broken up as a matter of calculated design and the result was a successful eradication of language and customs but ancestral lifeways are not so easily stamped out the negroes accepted the christian religion which had been forced upon them but they could not help imbuing their own version of it with characteristics which can to this day be traced to african sources they also put their own stamp on the ritual and liturgy of the church giving their worship an unmistakably erotic emphasis that is especially prominent in their music the negro spirituals gospel singing and the blues which followed became important elements in the growth of jazz these influenced white musicians everywhere in the country it strongly affected not only their music but their lifeways and sexways as well and always in the direction of a more natural expression of sexual needs and drives in the early fifties all these influences culminated in the renaissance of poetry and later in prose which was called the beat movement and is now simply referred to as the new writing the role that jazz plays in the sexways of the beat enclaves is crucial in early new orleans the name of the music is lost in the shrouds of mystery that still cover most of the negro history in america in the middle west and in other parts of the country among the white population jazz became very early a synonym for the sexual act jazz me blues is one title which suggests that the words jazz and the sex act were indeed synonymous in early usage the negroes under constant surveillance for anything that might be used against them by their plantation masters and afterwards by the klan and the police were accustomed to disguising their meanings in language even in their private conversation nevertheless the erotic element comes through not only in their blues songs but in their dance and their instrumental music the blues were couched in language that everyone white and black alike could easily translate into words of common usage when music is used as a way of breaking through inhibitions and releasing the life force of the libido it has the effect of a religious catharsis not unlike that of ritual drama this is one reason why the censors and religious bigots react to jazz with fear and fascination bigots are awkward and guiltladen their arms are knives their fingers all nails when they try to make love they hurt each other they torture themselves with shame and pride with time clocks and unattainable ambitions they drag themselves over miles of broken glass and stone themselves with false confessions their usual remedy is to throw themselves on the analytical couch or sneak away to peep shows and stag affairs and burlesque houses jazz presents them with too direct a challenge to face headon it entices them to muscular and sexual reactions they cannot admit even to themselves let alone display openly on a dance floor they prefer to think of it as below their cultural standards as sin and sexual depravity in their african origins the musical rhythms and the dance movements from which jazz originated in part were part of the sacred tribal dances as a sacrament it enjoyed the sanction of the group it had the force of religious magic and social consensus not in the eyes of missionaries and white overseers of course to the slave traders we may be sure it was nothing more than pagan superstition unworthy of serious study something to be stamped out as heresy in the eyes of every good christian jazz is still under a cloud in fundamentalist circles it is still confined for the most part to night clubs and theaters only its cleanedup forms in the hands of white musicians are fully accepted in american musical circles many negro musicians have crossed over and disowned the erotic origins of their music at least within hearing of their white agents white music critics and white audiences in many circles however white and black it still remains a secret music with an erotic mystique of its own in fiction the subterraneans by jack kerouac offers the best treatment of the effect of jazz and the liberating effect of negro morality on the american youth kerouacs description of the people in the beat underground of san francisco in the fifties is found on page one of the book julian alexander is the angel of the subterraneans the subterraneans is a name invented by adam moorad who is a poet and a friend of mine who said they are hip without being slick they are intelligent without being corny they are intellectual as hell and know all about pound without being pretentious or talking too much about it they are very quiet they are very christlike  nowhere in america has negrowhite integration become more complete than in the subculture of the beat enclaves as the definitive solution of americas race problem the mattress solution as portrayed in the subterraneans and in all of the prose and poetry of the beat leaves little to be desired nowhere is the negrification of american morals portrayed with greater candor with all its heartaches and successes than in the work of the beat writers it reveals a world in which racial prejudice on every level is no longer a problem for white or black historically there has never been any successful solution of the problems of nationality race religion or color that was not sexual in character it is becoming clear that the us will be no exception jazz music was indeed the opening wedge toward the mattress solution in the us its enemies among the racial bigots north and south were perfectly right in fearing this would be the caseliberation from the antisexual judeochristian ethos may yet prove to be attributable as much as anything else to the influence of the negro in america this influence along with the retribalization of american society through the formation of enclaves of sexual and social experimentation may well be the decisive ones in the making of the new morality in his  novel go john clellan holmes attempted a clinical diagnosis of the beat generation which was to become the nucleus of the beat enclave in his novel get home free holmes carries a similar story on into the sixties it is the story of dan verger and may delano who are trying to put off the whole armour of god and achieve orgastic potency in and out of bed by overcoming the character attitudes and the muscular straitjacket of sexual repression which still inhibits them and keeps them from experiencing the apocalyptic orgasm they expected always anticipating the gun salute and worried if it doesnt happen as rollo may describes it disappointed by the failure of their efforts each goes homedan to connecticut and may to louisianain the hope of finding fresh supplies of orgastic energy at the root source what they find out is that you cant go home again to borrow a phrase from thomas wolfe because there is no place to go home to just as there is no longer any place to hide new york read greenwich village was full of ambrose bierces  all of whom were once admen or kid movie stars or communist intellectuals in mays world in louisiana she found herself drawn irresistibly into a world of jazz pot drugs and sex a black and white world in which neither was fully at ease and where she could find no conceivable answer to anything in connecticut dan finds old man molineaux the old survivor carrying on to his last drunken breath his oneman war against pollyanna hypocritical piety and puritanism and the halfdead but still heavy hand of the whole judeochristian antisexual antipleasure ethic in connecticut as in louisiana and everywhere that is back home to anybody the same questions and no answers that anyone can accept to light himher into a future that is worth waking up to in the morning even europe finally offers no salvation to dan and he returns to may in new york and an adjustment of sorts that uneasy peace of resignation and existential choicethatisnochoice which is the nearest thing to a religion for millions in this crisisworld of transition between two worlds millions who are too late for this world and too soon for the future a significant passage in get home free is the one in which paul hobbes a white disaffiliate from new york who has come to louisiana to find sexual liberation from a scrupulous christian upbringing encounters a yearold blind negro blues singer of whom he says to may im just studying with him in a waylike i used to study with irwin edman    youre crazy i said with a laugh i hope was warm but dont you ever miss new york every time i go into brentanos i expect to see you hiding among the textbooks sometimes when it rains    but he was staring at turtles glistening blonde pageboy and the carefully folded monogrammed handkerchief with which tp was surreptitiously wiping the perspiration from his forehead and at lawtells college ring and emmys charm bracelet but then orkie at which he snapped back with the old rather naive almost schoolboy eagerness in his eyes that had once made all of us unkindly call him the cheerleader but say what do you think of him though isnt he great hes just nineteenorchid small thats his given name you seeorchid yes actually  so everyone calls him little orkieand hes got a strange touch with flowers tooi mean they seem to understand himhe tends someones garden for moneyyou probably know them i cant rememberbut i stick with him thats what im saying growing confused and pausing to gulp at his new bottle but what he was singing there its all all rightremember he says that all the time when you ask him when you talk about things    no need to shake hobbesy he says and he means dont worry dont get nervous dont shiver that way laughing in the middle of it to hear how silly it sounded but thats what he believes i mean about everything  so  just go along waiting for him to show methis yearold nigra the word sounding curiously ugly because he had no drawl no but really im just studying with him in a way like i used to study with irwin edman he wiped his palm over his grizzled cheeks blinked sniffed and stared at me with a trace of his old embarrassment well  get to the end of my mind these days and theres nothing else to do but sleep  so you and dan didnt make it eh so pointed a change of subject that i felt called upon to explain in a few sentences well you know dan all those new england preoccupations he cant swing loose from them he cant stop caring i mean youll be drunk and happy and then hell say but can ail this lead to a new morality it just got pointless   he came out of the bathroom shirt back on but unbuttoned an indefinable languor to the soft pad of his sneakers though he looked sick to his stomach and his hands shook as he lit a cigarette oh wellpahpah lets see    no not working    why it was surfeit i suppose  i got surfeited  he glanced at the sign over the bureauhis selfconscious motto his reminder of something he easily forgot  do i know nature yet  he murmured by rote  do i know myselfno more words i bury the dead in my belly  staring at the sign reflectively and my arm he added with a little wince and then looked at me with a gloomy smile rimbaud i was always taught to identify sources its the hardest habit of all to break the sign of a ghoulish civilization  i mean ephesus and rotterdamseparated by twentyfive centuries and yet theyre both just unpiled stones when you think about it    no but surfeit he repeated brushing the tangle of hair off his forehead thats the word i got surfeited with literature and surfeited with politics and surfeited withwell just words  you know for six years i read four newspapers a day i kept up i cared i squandered my nerves shaking his head and sniffing the way you do when you remember the obsessive emotions of an old love affair its funny to think about it now i used to be positively melancholic because of the czechs or the bantus or someone honestly i mean it as if he were confessing to a folly of which even he could not quite believe he had ever been capable but you want to know something sometimes when im alone or very hung over or prescient from wearinessthe way you get sometimesi think were all going to wear ourselves out here in america just burn ourselves right up i have this vision of the nerves of america all the butchered ganglia the flayed tissue the teeth ground to powder in the night the cindery brains that are starting to run amok from the tension of life here now    and i find myself thinking that well never make it in this century because weve lost touch with somethingsomething wild and natural call it bliss or reality a capacity for spontaneous love whateverbut its the only thing that can renew the consciousness when its exhausted by anxiety    and i get scared real fleshfear my body telling me to stop something before i go too far rubbing his forearm painfully so i suppose what im really doing is searching for the natives for the lost america but like a schweitzerinreverse you see because i want them to help me because really only rebels and oddballs and outcasts can still feel freshly any more the ones the general and his crowd who are the deacons of the last american church social dont care aboutwho represent no power or influence and have no public interests and dont really give a damn about abstractionsthe one who are still free enough to perceive the wonder in whats left of the flower blinking selfconsciously at his own rhetoric and sniffing wella drunken sleep on the beach thats best  followed by a sheepish smile see i never did get over quoting other mens truths i quote orkie the same way these days how could i describe it or the incalculable aura of careless anarchy and underground freedom of whim which pervaded it it was as if you had gotten beyond all eyes at last all restraints all codes all dreary necessities and reached that oasis of overripe green and sensuous shadow that exists somewhere in every deserteven a desert as limitless as our lockstep ageand had nothing but yourself and whatever was inside you all that rich mystery of individuality that the penitentiary of modem society is bent on narcotizing to rely on a strange excitement tinged with unease roused in me no mere wisecrack would arm me here    let joy remain confined mumbled hobbes pedantic throaty voice from somewhere i couldnt see thats what the general would say if he could only speak cause joy smells of body odor and irresponsibility it stinks of the unreconstructed individual who wont play bingo and that could wreck the republic it could level topeka giggling to hear himself for dan and may the search ends in failure except for one thing they know now why they failed that the search for the new morality was too much for them that they are doomed to be among its casualties not its successes the erotic revolution offers no guarantee of success to anyone the search for the new morality claims its failures but it also rewards its successes it is the function of the writer to mirror both with fidelity and devotion to truth if the stories of failure are more numerous in contemporary fiction than the stories of success it is because most experiments are failures in sexual morality as in everything else for some as we have seen sexual experimentation is not as difficult as it is for others as the judeochristian ethos continues to lose its grip on our educational institutions on government police and the law as its vested interests fall into decay and its diehard defenders retire from their rearguard positions through defection or old age the new morality will show a higher and higher percentage of successful experiments until no one will think of them as experiments any longer and the vision of the new poets and mythmakers of today will finally be seen as a prophecy of the new lifeways and sexways of tomorrow
mama george frederick whispered when we gonna stop and rest sweat was running in little rivulets between patches of hair down to his brow and she noticed he needed a hair cut wheres your hat georee frederick i dont know he shrugged his shoulders i couldnt find it when we were leaving libby frowned at him and swung the baby onto her shoulder carefully pulling the ragged flowered bonnet over his face to keep out the sun if he had a hat at least nobody could tell he needed a haircut she looked down at the children who clustered around her wishing she could hurry up and see the while peeling sign that said health clinic all she saw over the tops of the childrens heads was the fiat dusty road and the grayish red dirt that settled between the toes of her sneakers and made her childrens canvas sneakers stiff with grime mama im getting tired wicker caught hold of her hand and tried to slow her down were almost there now she said when we get up to the filling station well rest and dont any of you start begging me for a coke either we cant afford none the small group of children looked at her sadly cant we even split one wicker asked his mother patted the baby on the back and ignored him the little group walked along much slower than before and a few yards ahead libby could see the curb of the service station and the row of chinaberry trees that lined the turn oft stopping at the esso station always made her feel a little uneasy back when she was first married and hal was still going to school some he used to work there after classes still the station was a good halfway place to stop on the way to town and the kids liked to see the cars go up and down on the elevator she walked slowly changing the baby from arm to arm but before she could settle him comfortably on her shoulder they were at the station the children ran immediately to the trees and played under the dark green leaves that made a pleasant canopy of shade she sat on the curb far away from the main working area rocking the baby who had started to fret the baby was a solid lump in her lap and she was too hot even to care libby watched her children who now that they could rest were chasing each other around the chinaberry trees she was just sitting still staring down at the curb when she saw matts grinning face and waving hand pointing toward her in school matt and hal had been best friends when matt graduated from high school the white man mr sommers had kept him on at the station he had a good job and she used to go with him in elementary school last summer matt sent them an invitation to his wedding when he married that girl from chesterfield county but she couldnt go because they didnt have any extra money to buy presents she watched matt look around to see if any customers were coming and then he bypassed the gas pumps to the curb where she was sitting he stooped and peeped at the baby sure nice he takes after you as if he had spoken a magic word calvin smiled and his dark eyes followed the oily finger that matt swung over his head that boy of yours come back he asked suddenly becoming serious she shook her head no you know where he is again she shook her head that damn son    but before he could finish libby pulled his arm and pointed to the children who had stopped playing to watch their mother i dont want them hearing none of that the children stood waiting until their mother shooed them away hasnt sent you any money either i bet matt squatted on the curb beside her if you need anything right now you jet me know and if you dont hear anything from hal soon you see those county people we dont need to be on no welfare she interrupted hell anybody can be in trouble for a while beside you got to feed those kids i got me a job working in town she tried to keep her voice from breaking your mamas not going to keep that baby forever shes getting too old to be picking up after little children thats not your business libby answered quickly nobody told you to get mixed up in my business all right all right matt stood and in the sunlight he appeared as a black shadow hovering over her and the baby but if you need anything promise me youll let me know libby sat on the curb not looking at him trying to keep her tears from falling on the baby shed promised herself she wouldnt be bothered thinking about hal and here she was crying like a fool baby while she sat still letting the heat dry her tears matt treated all four children to soft drinks he made meetrie bring one to her and then they were ready to start walking again   f  v the county clinic was on the  second floor of the courthouse building as the children climbed the steps she tried to freshen them up sticking in wickers shirt tail and trying to keep hamlet still enough to brush the coca cola from his pants not until she passed a clear glass pane on an office door did she see her own reflection the shoulder of her cotton dress was wet where the baby had burped she herded the children together and let meetrie lead them up the stairs past the main waiting room into the cubby hole that served colored nine other people were in the waiting room ahead of her and there were only two seats left she took one chair and meetrie and wicker squeezed into the other seat libby reached over wicker who was leaning on the chairs arm and picked up a copy of the post the magazine was the same one she had read when wicker had hay fever maggie haliday one of the maids in this building told her once that the magazines were only put in here when the white people were finished she saw a life on the other side of the room but didnt feel like walking to get it or to start up one of the children all of whom had chosen this moment to be quiet she looked around at the other people waiting to see the doctor trying to decide if she knew any of them one of the women the one with the hair in little sausage curls reminded her of hals aunt but of course she wasnt hals aunt lived in bethel the woman looked up at her and smiled libby smiled back all these children yours the woman asked yes libby turned calvin around in her lap this one she said pointing to meetrie will be ready for school next year one more off your hands the lady began chuckling but i guess youll have enough on you anyhow the woman had a thyroid condition she said and whatever the doctor gave her didnt do any good last night shed had one of those attacks and the first thing this morning shed come to this place and look at her shed been here since eightthirty and already it was eleven minutes to ten while she talked a nurse came in and asked who was next a pregnant woman stood and shuffled toward the gate that separated the waitingroom from one of the inside offices when the woman was safely inside the office the nurse turned and pointed a finger toward libby you she said in an expressionless voice keep that child out of the ashtray libby turned in time to see george frederick digging in the sand of a tall cement ashtray she was too embarrassed to do anything but grab him and sit him down beside her the other children were becoming restless now and she knew that if the doctor didnt see them soon they would be a problem in such a cooped up space all your children sick the woman asked her libby sensed that she just wanted someone to talk with no theyre pretty healthy she said mr johnson said positively meetrie couldnt go to camp unless she had some kind of shot he said with the others running around outdoors all day they should get shots too  guess the nurse will know what to give them she doesnt look old enough to be off from home by herself in response to the womans thoughtful stare meetrie began wiggling in her chair oh shes not going away from home shes just going to day camp mr johnson he works with the community fund got her a scholarship she said proudly white folks are always packing off peoples children to camp seems like they could think of something better to do with their money libby nodded and both women were silent your husband work around here no hes working up state how come he left you by yourself suddenly libby was tired of listening to the woman she certainly wasnt going to get a complete stranger mixed up in her life calvin here was too little to travel so i stayed with the children her words were curt but the woman paid the tone no attention guess you miss him but with all those children its a good thing hes up north working i bet he sends you more money than he brought home when he was working here libby did not say anything but shifted calvin to her other shoulder and picked up the old copy of post from her usual way of feeling time pass she guessed they had been sitting in the waiting room for over an hour a man with a swollen foot began smoking and since there was no ventilation unless the door stayed open cigarette smoke hung heavily in the air she wanted to ask the man to stop smoking because the baby was coughing but he was so much older than she that finally libby decided to walk up and down the hall to get some air she ordered george frederick and meetrie to watch out for the younger children and walked out the door she had just started down the hall a second time when the same somberfaced nurse stuck her head out the door immediately libby was conscious of some one sniffling your kids in here raising sand the nurse said we ask you people not to deposit your children in the waiting room when only ones sick why dont you leave the rest home meetrie started it she heard wicker say just as the nurse shut the door she saw meetrie lean over and kick  george frederick then meetrie fell on top of the boy and began pounding him with her skinny fists meetrie libby screamed get off that floor she looked for some place to put calvin afraid to put him on the chair because he might roll off george frederick was still on the floor and she hated him for pretending to be hurt quickly she bent down to pull up both children and almost dropped calvin george fredericks yellow pants had splotches of dirt from where he had rolled on the floor she pushed the children together and made them sit in the chair the funny thing was that they hadnt disturbed anyone in the waiting room everybody sat quietly hoping to be called in to see the doctor libby felt the minutes ticking away wishing that some of the people in the crowded waiting room would leave and come back tomorrow if the nurse didnt call for them soon she knew theyd have to go home she hadnt thought to bring anything for a lunch and they couldnt afford to buy anything out of the cracker machine libby could hear feet moving around in the next room and each time the footsteps approached the waiting room she felt her muscles becoming tense the children were getting edgy and george frederick had started sucking his thumb the same hand that had scooted in and out of the sand she started to reach out and remove his thumb but decided that at least this way he was quiet she raised forward on the edge of her chair to relieve the strain on her back feeling the cloth of her dress stick to the plastic back of the chair calvin had fallen asleep but he seemed to be heavier when still libby knew he would be hungry when he awakened but there was nothing to feed him that she could afford she found herself offering a prayer to be next feeling that right now she would promise god anything if she could hurry up and leave this clinic it occurred to libby that thinking and dreading today so much probably made her nervous her mother was bound to ask if hal had sent her an anniversary card and all this week shed expected to hear something from him then this morning came and she stood ten minutes on the front porch waiting for the mailman who rode by without even leaving one of those advertising circulars she felt her stomach grumble and swallowed hard to stop the noise if she was hungry she knew the children soon would be begging for something to eat as a last resort she decided to think only of happy things but that too was impossible everything she thought about seemed to have happened after she was married and not before she looked down at the baby remembering when she had sat in this room pregnant with meetrie it was in the hospital that her mother seeing meetrie for the first time had slipped her own bent wedding ring onto libbys finger because hal had not yet bought her one she looked down at her finger seeing the narrow gold band dull after six years sometimes she felt that she had a wedding ring and that was all in the middle of her thoughts she was aware of someone pulling on her sleeve mama wicker whispered i gotta go to the bathroom get meetrie to go with you and unbutton your pants meetrie looked up at her mother i dont want to go in there all by myself libby didnt much blame her the lightbulb usually was out in the toilet and regardless of the disinfectant the room smelled awful mama i gotta go bad wicker was standing on one foot and then the other libby stood and grabbed him by the hand she couldnt take all the children with her or she would lose her place in line yet if she left them alone they were bound to start up something the toilet for negroes was all the way down in the basement and if she didnt get wicker there soon he was likely to wet right in the middle of the floor suddenly the woman she had talked with earlier was at her side you take him on downstairs she said picking up calvin and ill watch them up here and save your place libby smiled her thanks and hurried wicker from the room knowing that george frederick would have to go by the time she returned she pulled him along coming back upstairs libby walked so fast her legs ached when she reached the second floor she couldnt risk having the little boys see all those candy and snack machines maybe if they didnt see food they wouldnt be hungry the big clock over the main door read twelvefortyfivethey already had been waiting over three hours after the lady had been so nice to take calvin libby felt she ought to introduce herself im alma courts the woman answered and he was a real sweetheart she settled in her chair expecting libby to continue their conversation although talking to mrs courts helped time pass libby didnt want to be questioned too closely she found her place in the old magazine and began reading she had not finished the first column when the nurse popped her head inside the door you people go on home and come back monday she said huh a man said and a few people raised out of their seats  cant come back on monday his voice was joined by a chorus of me neithers libby stared at the nurse as if  the woman were crazy and she wanted to knock that silly starched cap from her head she coudnt come back on monday and bring all of them there was no telling when shed have another saturday off the nelsons hardly ever went away for the weekend the doctors are leaving early the nurse continued as if no one had interrupted her speech you come back on monday and theyll try to see you then she closed the swinging door and the people in the waitingroom heard a key turn in the lock well aint nothing we can do the man with the swollen ankle said cept come back i already lost three days off the job dont guess one more day will make no difference he stood and grimaced in pain shifting his weight to the foot that was not hurt libby stood and immediately the baby began hollering she felt his rubber pants and saw that they were heavy there was nothing to do but change him in the waitingroom mrs courts looked at her sympathetically and wiped calvins slobbering mouth with a slightly soiled kleenex sometimes i wonder why more of us aint dead i could of had an appendix going loose inside me and it wouldnt made no difference to them you know anybody going to fir town libby spoke loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear no mrs courts said dont kuovv nobody with a car going that way since no one else seemed to be paying her any attention she stationed herself by the door nobody was going even part of the way in her direction libby prodded george frederick forward and handed meetrie the diaper bag to carry down the steps the clock on the first floor said twothirty the wrong time of day for her to try and catch a ride nobody she knew who worked in town got off from work before four on saturdays she hustled the children out the door and headed toward the corner while they were walking meetrie pulled away from her side and started to run across the street libby gave the child a jerk that almost made her lose her balance meetrie stood still rubbing her arm and looking as if she might burst out crying libby knew that when one child started up the others also found something for which to yell she bent down and touched meetries head waiting anxiously to see if meetrie would stop sniffling for an instant libby thought about keeping straight up the main street and walking around the shopping center she hadnt been window shopping in ages but keeping up with her children wasnt worth the trouble of seeing new clothes besides it was way past time for them to eat and the sooner they passed somebodys peach tree the better she shifted the baby to the other arm caught hold of wicker who was walking slower than anyone else and started home

he  was marias cousinshe begged me to giv her mothers sister child a job so i tof her to bring him alon and i would see what j could do for himwhich she promptly did the following day he was over six feet tall and well built belonging to the basuto tribe but bearing more resemblance to a zulu his teeth were white and perfectly shaped setting off the darkness of his face which was pleasant and shining with cleanliness while an abundance of wellgroomed woolly hair neatly clipped and telligent eyes met mine without a waver as he stood hatinhand in front of me so youre charlie i said smiling to put him at ease yes madam im marias mothers sisters child he answered in a deep voice and good english and where have you worked charlie in zeerust madam  have you a pass charlie yes mam he said handing me his reference book i flipped the pages of this nocuous brown book that caused more sorrow and bitterness than anything else in the country his picture was on the front page also his thumb prints and all the necessary information about chief kraal date of birth and tribe i turned to the back to see the name of his last employer and was unable to decipher the name whats his name charlie i asked pointing to the scrawl coetzee madam but that man does not write so well now i write with great beauty madam and use to help this white baas fill in the other boys passes who worked for him but i could not do my own the police would have noticed i nodded understanding and what work did you do for this man charlie on the farm madam but i do not want to work on the farm there is no money and i am educated standard six madam i went to the mission school and i want to do other things and live in joburg madam he spoke well without a trace of nervousness which was rare in my experience of interviewing africans in need of a job knowing of the different laws that were applicable to the blacks yet not knowing quite how they affected individuals i asked him if he was allowed to work in johannesburg oh no madam he replied  calmly and if im caught ill be sent to gaol then back to zeerust but charlie i exploded you know that i cannot hire you if your pass is not in order if i do we will both get into trouble you know it is against the law oh yes madam but maria tells me you can do many things to help us africans    you can get me a new pass he said simply but i cant charlie you know how strict the police are soon as you try and register at the pass office theyll put the handcuffs on you and you will get three months in gaol and when your sentence is finished they will send you back to zeerust please let the madam try he pleaded i want so much to stay in joburg i want to learn typing in the night time i sighed i knew that it was rather hopeless for i had tried on a number of occasions to get permits for africans who lived outside of johannesburg to work in the factory and i had never been successful he stood eyeing me hopefully alright charlie ill try but if they arrest you its your own fault he beamed maybe madam can take me home with madam in madams car they wont arrest me he was right for the police rarely arrested an african in the company of a white assuming the african to be legally employed i smiled inwardly he was not lacking any answer that was certain maybe its better if madam phone first to the pass office what a shame i thought by the readiness of the boys answers here was someone that was bright and intelligent and because of the colour of his skin he was not permitted by law the choice of working where he wished he was kept back in some dorp to work as a menial or on a farm digging in the fields i telephoned the pass office and asked to speak to a senior person was it possible i asked sweetly in afrikaans to get a boy with the necessary qualifications that  required for the factory a pass to work in johannesburg  could see in my minds eye the man shaking his head as he answered in the negative if you have such a boy he said it is your duty to see that he goes back from where he came or call the police he also warned me that i was liable to fifty pounds  fine if i employed him i gritted my teeth with frustration with charlie watching me closely a confident look on his face as if i were going to perform a miracle now continued the man if you live in a periurban area and you require someone to work on the land there might be a chance that you could get permission to keep him but then you must apply at the nearest pass office to your home i thanked him knowing that it actually was not his fault that charlie was unable to work at the factory however i suspected that he was in agreement with the ?village  laws controlling the africans as most of the police and pass office personnel were supporters of the government i repeated to charlie what the man had told me he was undaunted by the news but madam lives in the periurban area i can work for madam in the house im a first class worker and i can wait at the table i have done this work plenty times i burst out laughing first of all charlie it is not certain that i could get this permission secondly charlie i have a houseboy who waits at table and i also have two who work in the garden  so what am i going to do with you nonplussed he answered madam has a big house    maria told me madam has nyasaland boy working    maria tells me  can show these boys many things they do not speak english too much they dont know too much like me the latter was true as far as the houseboy was concerned not that he was unintelligent but he knew very little english and most of my instructions were given in mime with a bit of fanagelo simple type of african dialect used mainly on the gold mines thrown in the houseboy incidentally had also been a straybrought by one of the garden boys as much as i wanted to help charlie i certainly did not require another servant in the house for i also had a cook a woman which made a total of four servants    but i felt so sorry for him let me think of a plan charlie    today is friday ill think over the weekend and if youre not arrested by monday i will let maria know if i can do something he smiled broadly thank you madam oh many thank yous madam god will bless you i could see that in his mind the whole problem was solved now charlie dont go setting your heart on staying im going to try and think of something maybe my friends need someone but maybe they dont and then you will have to return to zeerust we parted he with optimism and many thanks and me with something else to worry about we lived twelve miles from johannesburg in a large house in threeandahalf acres of ground it was summer which meant that the weeds which grew at a fantastic rate from the rains were in profusion the two garden boys had their jobs cut out in keeping them down that evening  walked around the grounds eyeing the vegetable patches trying to find justification for hiring charlie if no one else wanted him i was lenient with the servants allowing them the responsibility of doing their jobs without constantly telling them what to do the head gardener lucien was a wonderful worker diligent and hardworking taking great pride in his domain c planting and sowing the various crops on his own merely telling me what seeds he required he supervised the second gardener who was younger and a more recent addition to the household and in fact another stray i knew that if i brought charlie into the garden picture there could only be one boss around and it would end up being charlie this i felt would be unfair to lucien it was early saturday morning and i was sitting in the garden having a cup of tea i glanced up the drive and who should be walking down with a sprightly air none other than charlie carrying a large suitcase the dogs rushed out barking furiously enough to scare anyone especially an african for they are extremely frightened of dogs more so if they are large ours were enormous but charlie just kept on walking as they rushed up to him he put his hand out and patted the largest animal the animals stopped their barking and walked next to him sniffing at his heels good morning madam he called out while still some distance from me youve a big house just like maria told me he turned his head taking in the expanse of the grounds and nodding approvingly good morning charlie  answered quite amazed at his appearance and what have you come for i told you i would let maria know on monday if i had a plan and today is only saturday well madam  thought i might be arrested by monday    you know that they often raid the township over the weekend he answered putting his suitcase down this i knew only too well well he continued  thought in your house i would be safe and if i were around you would not forget me and you would remember to think of a plan i chuckled dont worry charlie even without you around  was remembering but if you were worrying about getting arrested why did you take a chance and walk in the streets and go on the train and the bus i wondered how he would account for this logic on my part without hesitating he replied i thought of that madam and decided if i was to be arrested it might as well be on the way to your house madam than in the township alright i said throwing up my hands its against the law but since you are here you might as well stay go and speak to julie the cook girl she will give you something to eat but remember charlie dont go making trouble with the other servants    dont tell them that you have come to work for me and since you will have to sleep in simons room ask him if it is alright and also help him for this is the cooks weekend off oh thanks madam many thanks to you god will shine upon you and bless you he said his face wreathed in smiles picking up his suitcase he disappeared around the back of the house and soon i heard loud talking and laughing  charlie was getting acquainted when simon the houseboy was on duty on the weekends that julie was off we usually had to make do for he knew little about cooking and i had to see to the meals but this weekend was different    charlie took over an hour after his arrival he came outside sprucely dressed in one of i presumed simons white uniforms for it was about threeinches short in the arms and legs he wanted to know what we would be having for lunch i was somewhat taken aback can you also cook charlie oh yes madam i can do many things madam just tell me and madam will see for herself i told him what i had planned for lunch and he went off whistling confidently the lunch was a great success very well prepared and tastefully decorated simon instead of being upset beamed with pride at the obvious effects of charlies handiwork she too good boy medem said simon later as i entered the kitchen she i replied is a he simon and he does seem good oh yes medem she is a he   she one good boy i gave up most africans call both sexes she arent you worried ill keep charlie and let you go back home simon i said laughingly a look of puzzlement passed over his face i asked charlie to explain to simon in his language what i had said as charlie translated simon laughed no medem medem not send simon back medem keep charlie to help simon more to myself i said aloud you just cant win     a week passed and no plan matured with regard to charlie all my friends who might have been able to employ him since they lived in periurban area had enough staff meanwhile i knew that if the police came to the house and found charlie working without a pass i would be fined fifty pounds  charlie settled down and never broached the subject of pass job or wages he simply took over the management of the other domestics lives with apparently no ill feeling on their parts when he had been with us about three weeks simon came to me one evening with a sad look on his face and a letter in his hand medem me go home my father she very sick i expressed my regrets and asked when he wanted to go me go two days time me come back after and work for medem alright simon when your fathers better you come back its lucky i added to make him feel better that we have charlie oh yes medem now i not waste time to train other boy two days later with fond farewells ringing in his ears from the  household i took simon to johannesburg station to catch the train to nyasaland it would take him a week to get there and six months would no doubt lapse before his return  now i would have to try and get charlie a pass i took the morning off from work and went to the pass office nearest to our home which was at alexander township the huge location where some  nonwhites lived in one squaremile in utter squalor where crime was rife and the law abiding africans and nonwhites lived in fear of their lives a large number of africans were waiting to be attended to as i walked through a doorway marked european and i was immediately approached by a clerk i handed charlies pass book over he i had left in the car outside and stated my case telling the clerk what the man from the main pass office had told me theyre wrong said the clerk that law about being able to work in the periurban area was rescinded some six months ago youd think the joburg pass office would know this he scratched among some papers and found a form here it is in writing he said showing me the paper then what can i do i pleaded i do not have a servant and i need this man he is intelligent and a wonderful worker half laughingly he replied take a chance on being fined fifty quid pounds if they catch him you mean there is nothing i can do legally to keep him even though he wants desperately to work for me and i need him urgently im afraid not madam i know it is a shame when you can get someone good and you are not allowed by law to keep him he shrugged his shoulders but thats the law what will happen if he is arrested i asked he will be gaoled for three months  i interrupted and when he is released he will on his way from the prison be rearrested and sentenced to a further three months and this can go on ad infinitum im afraid so said the clerk and what is more i should by law have this boy arrested now he looked me in the eye i dont know your name i dont know where you live in fact you have not been here i thanked him and departed quickly for fear the police would arrive i decided to take a chance and charlie worked as before except we arranged what his wage would be i told him that if he left the premises he was liable to be arrested and i would be fined it was a terrible way to live but he was very willing to work under such conditions three days later charlie came to me with the request that i buy him a red sash to wear across his shoulder like all the head waiters wore in the hotels he felt that our position and his capabilities warranted this these were not his words but he implied them with a lot of smooth talk he took over simons white uniforms and laundered and starched them to perfection he was rather impressive in this role of headwaiter and we began to feel very posh on the fourth night after seating ourselves at the dinner table i was handed a typewritten menu by charlie who stood on my right with a napkin draped across his arm i could not refrain from laughinghe looked so serious and professional  did you type this charlie i asked looking at the neatly spaced lettersasterisks and dashes liberally decorating the top and the bottom the words were correctly spelled while a few a las gave it a french flavour yes madam i found the typewriter in the study and thought it was well for the master and madam to read what you were going to eat thats very nice charlie as long as you do not neglect your work you can use the typewriter i said oh thank you madam ill take good care of it he said with his usual warmth and flicked an imaginary crumb from the table that evening the meal was one of the most amusing we had ever had in our own home for we could hardly contain ourselves from laughing out aloud everytime charlie whipped the menu like a real professional before our eyes the menu had everything right down to cheese and biscuits something which we kept in the house but seldom had more than one to choose from charlie had discovered all my good imported cheese that i kept for occasions and at the end of the meal he proudly placed a cheese platter before us that would have been the envy of a toprate restaurant parsley sprigged and all on the menu was typed cheese various charlie was fascinated with the typewriter all his spare time was used in typing and  think that he typed letters to every one of his acquaintances throughout africa for every morning he would give me at least two letters to post since he could not venture from the property months later we found out from the cook that the moment we left home in the morning charlie would sit down in the study and type most of the day after working for us for about three months he became enamoured of one of the girls close by and this was his downfall one evening he came running into the lounge breathless and fearful oh madam he cried the police have come with a girl to catch me this girl she say  am father of her child she wants me to marry her i say no and now she come with her mother and a policeman my heart stopped for a moment then quickly i shouted to julie the cook tell lucien to go to char lies room and if the police want to come in say it is his room and julie if the police ask you about charlie say he left a week ago    tell the others to say the same our front door bell ranggo upstairs charlie to my bedroom and stay there he bolted upstairs like a rabbit bereft of all his selfassurance i went to the door and opened it my own assurance wavering on the porch stood a white sergeant and an african policeman with two native women standing a few feet from them good evening madam we are sorry to trouble you but these two women the sergeant pointed toward the two who shuffled into the shadows have laid a complaint about your boy charlie and whats the complaint  enquired acting surprised the young one says he is the father of her expected child i laughed with bravado first of all if she is in the family way it must only be a few weeks and its her word against the boys and secondly i took a deep breath charlie disappeared from here about a week ago    and now  know the reason i finished with a laugh the sergeant laughed with me and looking at the girl who was very thin said youre right madam there are no signs as yet and with such a prospective motherinlaw i dont blame the boy running away he directed the african policeman to tell the two women what had been said the women of course had a good idea of the discussion but it was duly translated to them the sergeant meanwhile apologized for bothering me stating that a complaint had been made and that this sort of thing was always happening and all he could do was to investigate i assured him that it had been no trouble wondering if the look of relief was visible on my face for the two women eyed me suspiciously then with some more bravado i said to the policeman you can question my other servants and search the quarters if you like oh no madam that wont be necessary he said and turned toward the two women in a harsh voice he told them they would have to find someone else to pin the blame on and for them to be off a whites word was always believed over that of a nonwhite and i felt ashamed and sorry for the two women but it was either them or charlie and in this instance the paternity case would not have meant a thing for the moment they found that he did not have a pass to johannesburg that would have been his biggest crime and no one would have gained a jot   except the south african government the police left and i went upstairs to my room expecting to find charlie he was nowhere to be seen charlie i called and from beneath the bed came a muffled yes madam i laughed you can come out charlie they have gone he crawled from beneath the bed a sheepish look on his face but he soon regained his composure that girl madam shes alright its that mother all she wants is lobola and the girl is only fifteen years he clicked hau these days a man must be too smart smart i snorted you mean have a smart madam who is getting grey hair every time she sees a policeman and then lying to the police on top of it i clicked the way the africans do when annoyed if i go to prison charlie wholl get me out he laughed loudly and was very amused hau madams too clever to go to prison i hear madam talk to policeman i listen at the window     only hide under bed when madam say police can search for charlie hau madam one clever one one week later poor charlie was arrested he had not been out for three months and then he went to see his cousin maria a gamble which failed to come off and there was nothing i could do since i had already broken the law twice our home was never quite the same without charlie we all missed him some three months elasped and charlie turned up to get all his belongings for when they arrested him he told them he had just arrived and thus did not give me away as having illegally employed him  asked him what he was  going to do for he had every chance of being arrested again and he told me that he was going to borrow some money and that if he could find such a one to lend him this money he knew of a plan that could keep him in johannesburg how much charlie i said knowing that i was going to be the lender his face lit up five pounds  madam ill pay the madam back one day he twisted his hands nervously as he looked me in the eye not certain if  had really agreed i could feel the tension for his plan could not be acted upon unless he had the money and five pounds represented a whole months wages to charlie  had a faint inkling that the five pounds was to purchase a forged pass book for other africans had told me this was often done and was not often detected if obtained from the right source you want this money for a pass book charlie i asked haul he exclaimed shaking his head a very surprised look on his face madam know about getting pass books this way yes charlie  just see that you get a good one he beamed oh thank you my madam oh thank you i pay you back one day he mopped his brow miraculously his nervousness had gone as i went inside to get him the money i heard him shouting out his glad tidings to the garden boys way down in the land that was the last i saw or heard of charlie not his fault im certain i just think that the forgery was not up to standard poor charlie his aspirations were high but the land where he was born only allow those with white skins to aspire
