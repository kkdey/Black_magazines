sixyearold phyllis wearing bright ribbons on her s £ braided pigtails and with the weariness of defeat over her  entire countenance walked heavily up the front steps  ignoring the ecstatic approving collie who bounced around yelping gleefully over her return home omitting a greeting she blandly announced the teacher doesnt love me she never lets me win a star a star it seemed was the symbol of success twelve years before abel had returned home literally carrying his broken heart in his hands they say they wont play with me because im colored in between those two beginnings don who was enrolled in a nursery school in pasadena that strove for acceptance of all races had no words he simply developed frequent abdominal pains before time to go to school i had no answer for abel but loud expressions of anger and recriminations for those who rejected him my answer to dons problem was to lie awake at nightand worry in both cases my reactions were of no value to my children nor were they of value to me because i felt so frustrated and helpless i was not prepared to meet the needs of my children in these unhappy situations when phyllis first announced the teacher doesnt love me i had no preconceived logical reply the answer just came and then grew until it was something of an answer it grew big enough even to give some support to the older children i answered the teacher doesnt have to love you shes paid to teach thats her job i am aware that children need love and approval in order to perform to their greatest capabilities but i am also aware that they are not always going to receive this love and approval hence they need to be prepared to function without it i have not seen fit to tell my children oh yes your teacher loves you youre just imagining that she doesnt i have told them that some people are prejudiced that these people cant help this maybe because theyve been taught that way some adults are indifferent to the needs of other people many other unhappy adults and children express their unhappiness by hating people but some people are warm affectionate and happily enough full of love for you and for other people it is my belief that children of negro and other minority groups should be prepared at an early age to cope with prejudice the current practice as i now see and remember what we did as parents is to send them out into the world defenseless just as we bundle them up to protect them from the cold we should also take some thought about protecting them from the ravages of hate a cold disappears with a few days care but if hate is not explored by each one it may take a person twenty thirty or forty years to know in his heart theres nothing wrong with me while some others may live their entire lives without ever having had this shocking revelation it may be that this kind of understanding would be of more immediate value to the sensitive vulnerable child however it is possible and highly probable that prejudice can have adverse effects on the most outgoing welladjusted child if the exposure is consistent and direct enough these children need an earlier exposure to the fact that hate is a human weakness that all people are capable of hating other people that the objects of hate need not be hateful that the hated need not be haters and that before and after youve been called a name youre still the same person with this understanding our children would grow to feel less depreciated would be less adversely affected by nonacceptance and would gain some freedom to pursue the business of attaining their full potential prejudice and hate are not going out of style we need to show our children what prejudice is and help them to perform in spite of it i offer these suggestions as aids not cures the cure will come gradually with the gradual disappearance of hate show the child ways in which outside adults are like the child himself explore these facts together tell them that teachers are human many teachers probably like ice cream cookies and candy better than spinach carrots and squash they probably would enjoy more fun and less work say to your child teachers cry sometimes by leading the child to think of a teacher as being a fellow human rather than some kind of supernatural being as children often think you help him to take a more tolerant attitude toward the teachers shortcomings children are most forgiving creatures show the child ways in which outside adults are like mother father aunts grandparents and so forth sometimes you might remind him we dont listen to what youre saying to us or we are not patient with you were thinking of adult things we have our special friends that we like very much and other people that we dont like and sometimes we hate people well other grownups are like that too explore with your child the many races of people in the world with their various colors features sizes customs beliefs likes and dislikes have him understand that no matter how painful race hate may be to him he is not the only object of hate name other groups of people living in the u s and the world who are living under circumstances similar to ours point out some of these people bodily if they are in your neighborhood it may be that your child has such classmates show him pictures of the different peoples in the world lead his thinking in terms of the great varieties within other species of life help him to reach the conclusion that he is not unique in being different tell the child of countries where he would be in the majority point out these places on a map of the world of course he cant comprehend a map but he has faith in your knowledge help the child to think about the different kinds of jobs that people do he can name the mailman the milkman policeman storekeeper and many others explain to the child that people are doing these jobs for pay in order to provide necessities for themselves and their families and that many of them might not like the jobs they have just as you dislike washing dishes or doing your chores some teachers may not like their jobs either whether or not we show wisdom in what we say to our children about race and prejudice we should talk about it too often in our inability to find reason in unreasonable circumstances in our desire to prevent pain for ourselves and our children we deny by silence the existence of prejudice and thus unwittingly become allies in the frustration of our own children well what about not winning the star i agree with the child that lack of love may be a factor in his not winning a star then give him some other ways of looking at it maybe there are children who need the encouragement more than you do or maybe the teacher thinks that you can do better at the same time i would be sure that the child is getting his work done not falling behind when the hope for approval and the enthusiasm for learning are lost help him with his work if you can and if you cant tell him i never heard of that and then find someone who can give him the needed assistancea classmate a neighbor a paid tutor visit the school get to know the teachers brave the cold atmosphere of the school somehow after all your child is doing it every day give overwhelming approval at home for every conceivable accomplishment from shedding of a baby tooth to the highest achievement have a place to display certificates awards commendations pictures a child should be told before he leaves home and mother that he might be called nigger and black he should be rehearsed in what to answer if you are called nigger you can ignore it or say my name is mary or im tommy  if you are called black you can answer its all right to be black or so what then you might also tell him you know you might also be called names like crybaby fraidycat skinny or fatso dont fail to remind your child that he too might be guilty of name calling sometimes even the same names that others call him a child who has not been subjected to name calling during his preschool years will be particularly open to this form of attack even though he doesnt understand it i reasoned with phyllis like this if you are called a broom or a dustpan do you become a broom or a dustpan or do you remain phyllis the child will accept this reasoning while this does not negate the unpleasantness of being called a name it does bring it into a different perspective there are those who might contend that this doesnt happen here in seattle that there is no need to prepare a child to face prejudice here such people do not know the child may not be called a nigger or black but he may be excluded from play birthday parties and other social functions and theres going to be the adult who looks through him or just cant ever be sure whether its mary or kathy they all look alike you know on this matter i sympathize with the adult who deals with many children for short periods of time but it is a different matter in a preschool or lower elementary grade where it is so important to a child that you know his name the teacher of our oldest son in a second grade class with two negro boys and twentythree white children was from september to january unable to distinguish between the two negro boys until i went to the school to tell her which one was which teacher prejudice can be so subtle that a child has no words to relate it to you there is beauty in our race that we fail to recognize oftimes we are so preoccupied with the beauty of other races we overlook or minimize the beauty of our own naturally our children admire the beauty of their white friends and classmates very often that admiration is mutual our children need this pointed out to them take your child to the mirror and show him his own beauty as you shop attend pta meetings church comment on the beautiful negroes that you see your child will see them too dont allow him to grow up feeling that only whites are beautiful encourage and lead the child to identify with his own race this can be done without interfering with a childs preference for friends children as well as adults need friends of all races but most of us need the security that group identity offers use your own methods the adults in our family have a strong preference for negro friends and associates our children too seem to have this inclination we subscribe to negro publications buy recordings of african and negro artists negro dolls and stories attention is always called to pictures and news stories of noteworthy or famous negroes we patronize negro businesses or those that employ negroes even when it is less convenient to do so invest in success rather than its symbols as low income workers we should spend more money for our childrens health and education less for cars lavish furniture and clothes true you cant go into a shop and buy good health or a degree but developing and carrying out an educational program not merely a public school education which provides for additional skills training and experiences costs money takes time and thought a child needs more than a facade of status he needs emotional security a truly adequate person may have less need for acceptance believe in something and give your child something to believe in whatever your faith or lack of faith a child needs guidance he should not be abandoned to wander around in a maze of conflicting ideas give him something to begin with he probably will do some thinking of his own later in life we are christians we take our religion seriously we teach it in our home and strive to live by its principles i personally believe that the time will come when each individual has a need greater than he or his parents can fill he will need god much of this will be of small comfort to the very young child but he will be strengthened by knowing that you understand and care and that there is love and approval for him at the end of the day as you sharpen his awareness of the complexities of the human being and his own beauty and worth and help him to develop you lessen the probability of his accepting the implication that he is of less value than other people he will be of course keenly aware of injustice uncomfortable in nonaccepting situations but he will also be aware that the evil is in the system not in his race but after you have done all that is humanly possible to help your child through these devastating unhappy experiences there will still be the nights when you walk the floor and cry and curse and pray by all means do not let such things discourage or silence you 
the race problem is our problem in amer ca
the excellent special august edition of ebony spoke comprehensively and eloquently of the white problem in america in its thesis that it is the white man who must change his attitudes and actions kb rather than the black man if racial problems are to be solved that the white man must change his attitudes and actions toward negroes far more drastically than he has even in the past few years is undoubtedly true but it is an oversimplification to imply that it is the white man only who must change it is neither the white problem in america nor the negro problem but rather our problem in the special august ebony issue mr john h johnson editor and publisher said    we as negroes look at the white man today with the hope that our effort will tempt him to look at himself more thoroughly with a better understanding of himself we trust that he may understand us betterand this nations most vital problem can then be solved with the help of negro prodding in various ways the above process is taking place in american white people president lyndon b johnsons confessions to his own past limited sympathy for negro people and their problems is typical of newly acquired insight by many white people i know that i am constantly revising my attitudes concerning negro people as i read more of their writings and get to know myself better in the process hoyt fuller editor of negro digest and i had a frank and spirited correspondence this past summer concerning some aspects of our problem like the woman convinced against her will i am of the same opinion still regarding the particular issues we were discussing and i have no reason to believe that mr fuller succumbed to my arguments nevertheless mr fuller caused me to do some serious soul searching since white and black people approach our problem with different biases i usually preach one way to white people and another way to negroes trying to get each of the two groups to understand and to help the other therefore what i am writing here for a preponderantly negro audience does not reflect accurately the efforts i make to awaken white people to their responsibility in seeing  that negro people have full freedom rights and privileges what this article purports to do is to speak frankly as a white man concerning how i react to certain negro attitudes and actionsin other words to reverse the process of which mr johnson spoke i have reluctantly come to realize that any claim of friendship on the part of any white man for negroes will be greeted with a good deal of open or covert scepticism by many individuals in the latter group also my motives and insight will be suspect by many negroes merely because i am white but those who are willing to listen may gain some new insight concerning themselves as well as the white man from the pen of one who really believes he is a genuine friend of the negro whether i am a genuine friend even a patronizing or naively ignorant friend can and will be questioned and perhaps rightly so but surely there is something for negro people to learn in listening to one who believes that the future of our country and of all individuals in it depends upon a deemphasizing of color and race many people with good motives are seemingly willing to set up one group of standards for negro conduct voting job qualifications etc and a more stringent one for white people in an effort to change a situation that has always been just the opposite i too am among those advocating this present course but i do so with fear and trembling for the longrange good of american black and white people alike justice and understanding demand this temporary venture into what is basically unjust and discriminating but if freedom can be easily and permanently gerrymandered even in a necessary cause and if in the process black and white people become increasingly isolated behind chauvinistic racial barriers the future freedom and happiness of american individuals in any race is doomed therefore my estranged negro brother regardless of whether you accept or reject my friendship or however you judge me and what i feel and say i shall not add still one more indignity to what you have had to endure by condoning attitudes and conduct in you that i would condemn in white men if any individual among you indulges in racial hatred or breaks the laws of decency necessary for civilized law and order i shall oppose his harmful attitudes and actions even while understanding the social forces which made it easy for him to be that way all my adult life i have opposed injustice by white men to black ones in spite of threats social ostracism and damage to my professional status i did so because it was right i did not do so to create a reversal of injustice and to support a climate of hatred and distortion it is growing more apparent to me that while the long range future with its options to continue racial differences and return either good or evil for evil belongs to the colored races of the world the immediate future of the negro in america is somewhat clouded by growing resentment on the part of many white people who have at least in recent years been advocates of negro causes since history indicates that as any oppressed people unless checked gains privileges it becomes less satisfied and demands more and more even to the point of oppressing its former tormenters i think we can reasonably expect more and more violence and racial hatred in our country but somewhere along the way enough people of both sides must love their brothers with different skin colors no matter what provocations occur until loves slow but permanent healing force extinguishes the devastating fires of hatred only thus can a meaningful and longcontinuing american civilization grow out of the compounded injustice and intolerance of the past we white people need your help james baldwin writing to his nephew in my dungeon shook accurately points out this need the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them and accept with love for these innocent people have no other hope one constructive way to lessen tensions is for black and white people to curtail the tendency to overstatement which alienates rather than converts no matter how much temporary comfort such overstatement gives to its partisans for example the play in white america as i experienced it was in spite of its basis in fact and its powerful impact a preachment of hate and distortion which lessened its effectiveness the past is bad enough distortion of it primarily through significant omission is however a dubious way to bring a better future preaching of hate and violence is not likely to bring one friends and stable supporters it does cause one to wonder about motives i for one am not going to support unworthy means to achieve worthwhile ends no matter who sponsors such means attacking our countrys image in a biased way can seriously damage the future america with so much hope for the negro all negroes may yet come to regret the image of our country created by some overzealous advocates of negro causes granted that the image of america created by white men is probably far more damaging than anything any american negroes can do is hardly a good reason for negroes to cut off their noses to spite their faces the destiny of american negroes and whites is basically the same and this fact should not be minimized by either race finally i should like to say to my negro brothers that while i am fully aware that ones environment does limit his development it is high time that poor environment no longer be used as an indiscriminate shield to excuse unworthy conduct klansmen and those who shield them are the products of their environments too but they are nevertheless morally responsible for their attitudes and actions as they will someday soon be held legally responsible why should klansmen be condemned and negro violence and lawlessness excused the negro is winning his fight why should he place himself in a morally indefensible position that will only hurt his cause of course a primary burden also falls here on the entrenched white race to share its power and privileges in continuing the effort to create the best possible environment for people of all races and classes incidentally this burden is also a responsibility of negro upper and middle classes far more than is generally recognized privileged class indifference to the psychological and material needs of others is not limited to white people the only difference between us is color and time will take care of that difference in conclusion my negro brother i pledge to you that i am going on fighting for your rights in spite of actions and attitudes by some of you which make that task more difficult i however shall criticize you when you are wrong and expect your criticism in return for my shortcomings in a free exchange that is fitting for free and equal men
about a year ago i learned a good deal about uncle tomism in the united states i was returning from a weekend in saginaw a town in central michigan the greyhound bus on which i was riding was filled with many types of people for a while i enjoyed watching the people and wondering where they were going and why they were going and where they had come from then almost suddenly i became aware of the apparent lowerclass situations from which most of the passengers seemed to come both socially and economically the bus was racially desegregated although there were no colored to the back signs most of the negro passengers moved to the back anyway they were typical lowerclassed negro travelers they carried what seemed like dozens of suitcases and shoe boxes filled with food the women were fat some had four or five children hanging on to their shabby coats the children screamed and ran up and down the aisle the mothers in voices twice as loud yelled to the kids shut up yo mouf the caucasian section of the bus was equally revolting the women were equally as fat equally as loud and had an equal number of children following them instead of the southern negro dialect they spoke with a hillbilly brogue instead of shoe boxes they had brown paper bags filled with food for some reason however they maintained an air indicating that they were the bus elite passengers being negro myself i was embarrassed by the conduct of the negroes and disgusted at the actions of the whites boarding the bus i almost automatically took a seat at the front there was no other passenger to share the double seat and i was well content my contentment was shortlived however a negro man in his thirties stepped onto the bus he attracted my attention because he had no suitcase or shoe boxes he searched the back of the bus for an empty seat and failed to find one although there were several empty seats nearer him he walked back to the front of the bus to sit with me his action left me somewhat peeved and i gazed out of the window to avoid any efforts he might make toward conversation the bus proceeded the children  were wild and loud the mothers were louder and wilder the fathers just sat there and ate sandwiches from the shoe boxes or the brown bags after a few minutes the man sitting next to me handed me a copy of jet magazine he didnt say a word i didnt look at him as i told him i had already seen the magazine my efforts to maintain silence didnt work however he told me his name and said that he was going to detroit most of the passengers were he said he had lived in michigan all his life and had never been out of the state he talked on and on about his family and tried to get me to reciprocate i answered his questions vaguely and briefly and eventually he caught the hint that i was not in a conversational mood from his short oral autobiography i learned two things he was not very bright and he was obviously uneducated by this time all the seats were occupied the bus stopped in a small town and three men boarded one of them was a negro he walked to the back of the bus without hesitation and stood among the bulk of the negro passengers the other two stood near me at the front the new passengers fit in well with the negro and white stereotypes already on the bus one of the white men standing was obviously uneasy at having to stand he shifted his weight a countless number of times his eyes gazed up and down the aisle as if a seat would appear magically i sympathized with him but as the minutes passed his attitude altered and soon i was waiting for something drastic to take place it happened he said to the man standing with him some of these niggers ought to git up and giv us a seat my mood immediately switched from sympathy to hatred mr johnson didnt react that way however with instant humility he attempted to rise and give mr hillbilly a seat almost instinctively i thrust my arm in front of him to keep him from getting up mr johnson thought for a minute and realized that he was not obligated to give up his seat mr hillbillys pale face turned red and his eyes stared in anger i experienced a strange peaceful feeling the other passengers only stared the bus continued the children continued to scream and play in the aisle the women screamed louder than the children and mr hillbilly continued to stand    my timid fellow passenger is one of the few oldfashioned uncle toms who still hang on to their secondclass citizenship with strange humility although he had never been out of the state of michigan he is one of the people former mississippi governor ross barnett was talking about when he said  per cent of our nigras are not interested in racial integration negroes never express a desire to see their children mingle with white children in public schools it is factual that some negroes have voiced these opinions but it is dubious that they really believe it centuries of meek dependency have taught many of these negroes to say to white people what they think white people want to hear these people have been labelled by the negro community as uncle toms they are the people who are guilty of slavishness in their demeanor especially toward white authority for uncle toms the  supreme court decision caused no rejoicing those of little education were slow to grasp its significance and many who did were afraid that efforts to secure equal rights would cause them to lose their jobs and therefore their only means of making a living harry golden editor of the carolina israelite and author of several books on minority group discrimination says that uncle toms are silent and meek because they fear accusations of treason to denounce the cause of legally enforced segregation is a form of treason to southerners said golden the truly noble people of the deep south are silent because the worst crime in their culture is treason golden cited in his book mr kennedy and the negroes a situation in mississippi in which a ne gro had been charged with rape he was kidnapped from jail and lynched even though many people knew who the lynchers were they were never brought to trial why golden explains that the mississippians would not betray their oath to white supremacy they would not speak treason uncle toms are the negroes who are not necessarily afraid to betray this oath but are themselves dedicated to it through years of servitude and brainwashing golden goes on to say that as late as the s a few of these uncle toms placed ads in the paper saying noticei am not a member of the naacp    occurrences like this are rare today my friend on the greyhound bus is rare too the social revolution has caught most old uncle toms and has converted them through a growing pride in the fact that their race is handling its own revolution and winning big by  the majority of negroes in the united states were conscious of the injustices and degradation of segregation and all its tragic and uncomfortable results each sitin each demonstration each new civil_rights legislation has strengthened the willpower of servile negroes this new strength has made moderates of some of the former toms and militants or leftists of others today uncle tom has a new identity the name applies to anyone who thinks there is the least measure of goodwill toward the negro cause within the white community an uncle tom is any negro who seeks to convince his people that progress and justice can be achieved in lawful and orderly protest according to militant negroes negro civil_rights leaders are among the many advocates of nonviolence who have been labelled uncle toms when dr martin_luther_king jr received the nobel prize last year there was widespread fear that he would lose his position as the modernday moses of his race and be branded an uncle tom however king has managed to keep his primacy in the eyes of the negro public his several jail sentences along with his continuation to march and demonstrate with his people have secured his position as a leader of the struggle in a sentence he follows his own orders he risks his life there is nothing uncle tomish about him dr_king summarized his feelings and the feelings of the negro public when he said to american whites we will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you but we cannot in good conscience obey your unjust laws    we will soon wear you down by our capacity to suffer and in winning our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and conscience that we will win you in the process james farmer national director of the congress on racial equality core once said if an individual is waging a militant struggle if negroes are convinced he is concerned about their interests rather than his own he wont be called an uncle tom farmer however was not as lucky as king he could hardly get these words out of his mouth before he was stamped an uncle tom by the militant negro community there has been much speculation that malcolm_x was shot down because he had become an uncle tom as a black muslim and later as the leader of the black nationalists malcolm_x was the epitome of militancy however when he began to confer with other civil_rights leaders and when the word nonviolence entered his vocabulary some felt that he had crossed the line toward uncle tomism    negro leaders are involved in a painful dilemma they must convince negroes that they are interested in the cause while maintaining rapport with the nonnegro community this latter function is an essential responsibility of negro leadership militants say that this rapport is immaterial that basic rights exist and should be taken by force if necessary they say that they can fight the negro revolution without white hypocrites and footshuffling black white people this militancy has sprung from the emotions and feelings that prevail in ghettoes where hope is trapped out and despair trapped in these people have heard too many promises of jobs housing and education and not enough results one example of growing militancy is a budding organization in the midwest called uhuru swahili for freedom uhuru is primarily a student organization but it attracts scant but multiplying numbers from the professions its members have taken militancy to extremes according to nonviolent standards in detroits recent effort to host the  olympic games a crosscountry marathon race from los angeles to detroit was staged by local track stars as the last runner approached the finish line a crowd gathered to greet him and sang the star spangled banner uhuru representatives burst out into catcalls and boos they screamed to the negro trackman run on uncle tom the group theorized that the olympics would only benefit the white community and the white businessmen and that any negro advocate was defeating the negro cause in favor of white supremacy uhuru like other militant organizations springing up all over the country wants results about the only thing that will quell their fire is freedom or as they say it uhuru quito or freedom now  if vicepresident hubert humphrey is exemplary of the growing sympathy of american whites there is no need for extreme militancy or extreme servility within negro ranks the vicepresident recently summarized what he and civil_rights leaders believe to be the prevailing opinion on civil_rights let me say simply that i am aware that different civil_rights advocates have widely varying opinions on the degree of gradualism acceptable in their fight for equal rights and oppotunity and on the means to achieve these goals my own position is that nothing less than total assimilation of the negro into our political and economic life is acceptable this country cannot countenance two classes of citizenship
there are a great many decisions which go into the purchase j f i g of a new car and of great importance is how you are going to r i ii  pay for the car sure shop for the best deal and satisfy your¦tbaiirfs self that you have the classiest car on four wheels but dont overlook financing and insurance costs it is not uncommon for car buyers to save  or  by shopping for financing and insurance before they buy some people have saved as much as  first consider financing seven out of ten persons finance their car purchases it costs money to borrow just how much it costs depends on where the borrowing is done where are some of the places that will lend money or help make a loan there are auto dealers who have arrangements with finance companies finance companies themselves credit unions and banks even your insurance agent who often works with different banks to help get the lowest financing costs so he can keep you as an insurance customer is a prime contact when you are looking for money to buy a car insurance companies like state farm mutual even have car finance plans under which their agents direct customers to banks that will lend money to customers who are acceptable credit risks how much do rates vary between different lending institutions and in different parts of the country a  university of chicago survey of nine cities disclosed for example that in new york city dealers finance charges ranged from  to  while banks offered money with  gross finance charges the equivalent of about vi per year of the original balance this means a new yorker financing  on the purchase of a new car would pay from  to  to finance his purchase through an auto dealer it would cost him  to get a bank loan to make the same purchase a difference of between  and  on finance charges only and thats on new cars as hillel black says in his book buy now pay later rates for secondhand cars are invariably higher for old used cars rates may range from  to  per cent true annual interest why the big variation basically its because of the difference between an interest rate and a finance charge many people think these two things are the same but they are not an interest rate is the rate charged for borrowing money the rate varies depending on where the money is borrowed bank loan company credit unionwho borrows it his credit rating collateral general financing statushow much is being borrowed and for how long in any event the interest rate is regulated by law a finance charge is something else again it is an amount of money added to the price of an item when that item is paid for over a period of time in effect it is simply a second price for an itemthe price the buyer agrees to pay when he buys on time thus a car may have two prices a cash price and a time price the gap is called a time price differential an important point to remember is this finance charges sometimes are not regulated by law this means the person charging the time price is free to charge whatever the traffic will bear fortunately the buyer is also free to shop around for the best deal no matter where the buyer gets his money he should bear in mind that the more he borrows and the longer he takes to pay it all back the more it costs him so to cut the cost of borrowing or financing to a minimum he should make as large a down payment as possible on his car and pay the loan back as rapidly as possible knowing this it should be obvious that a low down payment with  months to pay isnt always the best deal it may look tempting after considering the capital required to equip an entire business operation but it will definitely cost more these days increased competition is causing many auto dealers to cut the price of their cars and thus their profits to a minimum but they must make a profit somewhere to stay in business one likely spot is on finance charges when this occurs its the result of a mutually beneficial arrangement between an auto dealer and a finance company the auto dealer turns over his customers financing business to the finance company and he in turn gets a fat slice of the profit the following scale of rates available through a major national finance company operating in the midwest is an example of one such setup these figures were elicited at congressional hearings and show the amount the customers pay and how much of that payment is returned to the auto dealer a prospective car buyer residing in hillview illinois obtained figures from the auto dealer showing  for the unpaid balance of the car plus financing charges and  deductible collision insurance he went to his insurance agent who made arrangements at a local bank he paid  more as a down payment and was able to save the overall sum of  so much for finance charges insurance rates are regulated by state laws but yet they vary from company to company so once again it pays to check with both auto dealers and insurance agents the preceding example illustrates one particularly important area of insurance credit insurance the type of insurance itself is important because it assures the borrower that if anything should happen to him his family would not be responsible for the unpaid balance and that the car will belong free and clear to the heirs however the amount charged for credit life insurance varies a great deal sometimes it is included with the cost of the bank finance charge as was the case in the example given the important thing is that you must be aware of the cost it should be also noted that in some instances the rebate situation that exists between auto dealer and finance company on finance charges also exists between auto dealer and insurance company for instance the chairman of a large finance company admitted before a congressional subcommittee that his company gets a  commission from its insurance company on all the insurance its dealers sell what does all this mean to the prospective purchaser it means that his initial shopping trip should be just thata shopping trip and not a buying expedition he should leave his check book home and take along a paper and pencil instead then as he visits assorted auto dealers banks finance companies and insurance agents hell be able to write down the figures each quotes this lessens chances of being left with nothing but a jumbled memory of facts figures and percentages when the shopping trip is over first stop should be an auto dealer where the buyer should decide what kind of car he wants make model extras a list should be made of what accessories or extra each dealer offers so as to get a real price comparison next several dealers should be visited to find out the going price on the particular make and model the car buyer is interested in if there is a car to be traded in the buyer should first find out the cash price of the car then the price with trade in this will show exactly what is being gotten for the used car and sometimes it will pay to place an advertisement to try to obtain more than the amount being allowed for the trade in the next thing is to think about insurance and financing when shopping for financing the buyer should get both percentage figures and dollars and cents figures with respect to insurance the buyer should find out just how much coverage is being obtained for how many dollars if he is buying from an auto dealer with what company will he be insured is it reliable does he know others who are insured with that company if so are they satisfied if after checking and being satisfied about these items the buyer de cides to buy the auto with an insurance and finance package from the auto dealer he should get the dealer to make out an itemized list of just what is being bought and the price of each item auto extras taxes insurance and finance charges then he should make sure that this total is the same as was quoted at the time the dealer made the sales pitch where the dealer quotes a monthly payment figure for the entire package the buyer should find out how many of these payments he is obligating himself for by the signing of the contract    and  he should then multiply the monthly payments by the number of months and again check to see if that figure is the same as was previously quoted it may sound simple but better business bureau records are full of the sad woes of people who did not do this one official of the chicago better business bureau estimates that if car buyers would merely multiply the total number of months to be paid by the amount of the monthly payment about  of the complaints the bureau receives would be eliminated the story is told extreme but true of a man who looked at a car advertised for  and asked how much the monthly payments would be he was told  per month and feeling that he could afford such a moderate payment signed a contract without first reading all of the clauses what he did in fact sign was to pay  per month for a total of  months all in all a total of  for the car all of the foregoing can lead to only one conclusion when you are shopping for a car shop examine the facts compute the interest and insurance charges watch what you sign make sure all of the pertinent parts of the contract are filled in before you affix your signature failure to do these things can cause financial loss and disappointment instead of the intended satisfaction of a sound investment 
among the children of the very poor survival must take precedence over every other consideration but current motivational theory tends to downgrade immediate and physical motives it turns its eagle vision instead like a rising young executive on goalstriving statusseeking and planning by such elite and middleclass standards the poor must be said to have little or no motivation under a grant from the national institute of mental health we have been studying a large st louis housing development inhabited almost exclusively by very poor negroes we middleclass observers have noted the pronounced tendency of the tenants toward randomlike and unrealistic behavior their attitudes toward space time objects and persons lack our patterns of organization lack our predictabilityeven sometimes seem to lack sense  to us how do they seem to the project dwellers themselves after more than a year of field work with about fifty families we have the strong impression that they are well aware of the differences for instance they make a strong distinction between cp colored peoples time and wp white peoples time according to cp time a scheduled event may occur at any moment over a wide spread of hoursor perhaps not at all they believe however that in the highly organized world of the whites it occurs when scheduled the housing project is so isolated from the social and economic life of the city and the white community that the occupational classes of the census bureau scarcely apply to it the tenants work as domestics or in the nooks and cracks of our economy employment is uncertain pay is poor resources are scarce yet unemployed men talk of jobs they do not have and the women in this city of women speak of husbands dead fled or who never existed illusion is thus a way of life young and old spend money they do not have for expensive clothes and cars people with no power and status brag of influence and position and concentrate on getting the better of each other the illusion of middeclass success settles invisibly over them thus a white school teacher working with negro children remarks that they are not interested in solid accomplishment but only in showing off obviously such shortcutting must interfere with learning and with facing school and life realistically casting out the poor and the negro from white society has resulted in a social life so saturated by illusion that the fancy soon becomes the only possible achievement disorganization and a life of fit into the social dynamic of the school room to create educational underachievement the children of disorganization cannot create classroom organization  and the teacher can only work with those who have somehow managed to acquire enough of the necessary motivation often we have seen a harassed teacher working with a very few children in a class and trying to ignore the disorder and uproar the others are creating here are some notes made in one such sixth grade classroom with both negro and white children the teacher was leaning over pauls desk helping him with arithmetic irv and mike were watching alice was talking to jane and joan to edith nearby alan ed and tom were pushing and shoving tom got out of his seat made a wad of notebook paper and tossed it into the air several times tom and ed suddenly slammed their desks shut got up and walked out noisily lila and alice followed alan grinned at the observer waved his hand and said hi the teacher took no notice   this process of partial withdrawalwhereby the teacher simply withdrew to those few students she could handlemay occur anywhere an individual tries to cope with a disturbed environment i have also seen it in mental hospitals it reflects not so much the relationship between authority and client but the total social situation in school pupils have the choice of building status either with their teacher or their friends to many reputation among friends may be much more important the pressure of peergroups is very strong and selfdestructive status choice can occur in any such conflict between the demands of authority figures and the demands of the group what usually tips the balance toward teacher and selfpreservation is a measure of hope in the future disorganization can tip the balance the other way this is especially true if the disorganization has unique attractions for the children in integrated classrooms the approval of white students may become so attractive to negro children that they gladly risk official displeasure punishment or failure in coeducational classes attracting the attention and getting the approval of the opposite sex can become much more important than teachers dirty looks all such split situations introduce disturbing and competing elements students can make status choices that ruin their whole future lives very very poor children both by feeling and understanding lack the structure on which conventional education can build their background does not have the elements of order necessary to achieve their homes are crowded full of disturbance physically and personally disorganized they do not operate on schedules that pay much attention to school concepts of time they  lack both belief in achievement and fear of no achievement when thirty to fifty such children are a class supposed to be run by one teacher disorganization must result from it the teacher in sheer selfdefense may select only those elements suited to her taskshe will teach those considered teachable and let the others go but even the children most willing and able to learn are under tremendous pressure from their classmates to give up and join them by pleasing the teacher they can buy success in a vague and distant future only at the probable expense of making their present life lonely unhappy and even dangerous the poor motivation of the lowachiever is not therefore a demon somehow arising from and locked up inside himself but one effect of a whole sea of pressure and pain which has surrounded him since birth and in which he himself seldom knows why he gasps the missing ingredient but why all this disorder illusion and destruction does it come about because as some moralists believe the poor lack an essential fiber so that they tack and waver in the wind against which we advance this view is actually not far wrong the poor do lack a fundamental vitamin that we others absorb with the smell of food with the promise of gifts at christmas with plans for graduation they  lack the essential strength of hope hope is not a simple nutrient it goes straight to the heart of organization and makes it work among lower animals organization occurs largely through inborn genetic factors with man things are not so direct and the word culture has chosen to designate the complex learnings that determine his behavior but culture varies between societies and even between groups within societies for the middle and upper classes in our society achievement and security are major determinants they organize behavioror our behavior is organized around them they act as carrots the fear of their opposites failure and insecurityacts as a goad when people do not see success and failure as we do their behavior will appear to us random and purposeless and we disapprove of it but those who cannot hope for achievement or security can have no concept of the organization of behavior through time toward goals the culture of the middleclass itself has been superficially charted how for instance does the middleclass handle hope time and the self achievement depends on hopeand hope rests on time some time in the future we hope to achieve something even to say billy has stopped wetting the bed means that desired change has occurred through time billy used to wet the bed but does so no longer but the parent with no hope can have only partial understanding of his childs having stopped bedwetting he can have no fruitful concept of the conscious movement through time toward desired goals relative to large social goals his actions are undirected flight from death though the poor have little hope for life they do not wish to die according to comparative suicide rates they have less taste for final voluntary quietus than any other class therefore they concentrate on those factors that keep them alivenowthat make direct obvious and strong contributions to present life the culture of the very poor is a flight from death in this setting the very disregard of common methods of looking at things and objectssuch as how to arrange a housecan become institutionalized a way of life such disregard in objects we call disorder in behavior we call it randomness martin heidegger in being and time relates the perception of self to existence through time when people think of themselves they seem to say he argues that is the way i was this is how i am now and in the future i hope to be something else these perceptions of self have past present and future and it is from them he believes that we conceive time they presuppose change during time movement from what used to be to ward what will be self must therefore exist at least partly as a function of time it must include organization through time but what happens to a person who has no expectations or hopes for himself or his children his behavior having neither background nor direction is disorganized what is left of him in the irreducible ash the survival selfthe flight from death the survival self has no real sublimation or higher displacement nothing but physical lifein a very limited but very intense form the survival self must concentrate on those experiences which give it continual and vivid reassurance that it is aliveheightened perhaps and smoothed by drugs or alcohol it must literally keep feeling its life sociologists of middleclass background contemptuously refer to this state as hedonismliving for pleasure it is notit is flight from death the famous second law of thermodynamics states in paraphrase that disorder within an isolated system can only increase life is not pure physics but there is a useful parallel consider a middleclass neighborhood or suburb it is not an isolated system its members go out into the community and the community comes in at the door and the mind the resources of the community are known to and used by it and it is subject to steady cultural and economic stimulation which it in turn affects the interaction brings adjustment and reg ulation the disorder or randomness entropy in the language of physicsis low the slum or lowerclass housing project does not have access to these sources of support and stimulation a paradoxor vicious circleexists because of their disorganization and lack of hope the very poor cannot or do not get to the major sources of economic and cultural stimulation and their disorganization and hopelessness came in the first place from lack of access to these resources cut off from hope stimulation and change the poor neighborhood is an isloated human thermodynamic system and its disorganization can only increase many middleclass selves are also in flight from death but they are trained to look at life through the lens of achievement sustained by hope and expectation and they can fly along this pathperhaps even to greater achievement this sustenance is not available to the great majority from the slum and housing project our conclusion then must be that hope is a boundary it separates the free from the slave the determined from the driftingand the very poorest from almost all those above it a corollary conclusioneven more surprisingfollows time space and objects exist for us only when we have hope short of reforming his world how can we stimulate the slum child to greater school achievement certainly it will not be enough to merely improve teaching methods and curricula we must improve the school as a social system some proposals are in order ¦ building up perceptions children whose central milieu involves so much disorganization and disorder cannot master mathematics or any other discipline involving order and direction i would urge that these children be given preschool training in which the basic perceptions that other children acquire without apparent effort be deliberately taught for instance a child must learn fundamental shapes and categoriesinsideness and outsideness roundness straightness flexibility rigidity transparency opacity motion in a straight line motion in a circle rocking motion and many other basic perceptions a child should have this perceptual competence before he starts school ¦ calming down poor children often come to school unfed after wretched nights torn by screaming fighting bedwetting often they cannot sleep because of cold and rats they come to class hungry sleepy and emotionally upset to start routine schoolwork effectively at once is impossible i propose that teachers be specially trainedas they are in the youth development project of the greater kansas citymental health foundationto deal with such children and that they breakfast with them in school the school should of course furnish the food perhaps out of government surplus school breakfast would accomplish two things it would feed hungry children otherwise unable to concentrate adequately on their work and it would bring teacher and pupil together in an informal and friendly atmosphere associated with satisfaction before the strain of classroom constriction and peergroup pressures dictate that teacher become an enemy it is essential therefore that the teacher be present a program like this suggested by me in kansas city brought about immediate and sharp improvement in attendance behavior and in schoolwork the more the teachers know about the emotional management of these children the better ¦ expansion of participation the frequently proclaimed immediate goal of instructionmore personalized attentionis especially important with lowachievers this can be done by reducing class size or by increasing the number of teachers the extra teachers if not as highly qualified as the regulars should nevertheless be trained and familiar with the lessons they can be substitutes teachers in training or even members of the domestic counterpart of the peace corps whenever that is established they should be able to help with routine tasks with keeping orderand with seeing to it that each child very poor children need hope in has more time attention care and order to achieve so do those who opportunity to learn work with them
contemporary african art has been the subject criticism and among its critics is the man often called nigerias best known and most outstanding artist ben enwonwu paintersculptor the art of africa has never been the same since the arrival of europeans says the yearold ibo who achieved fame in his first love sculpture sculpture which i did not study under anyone else but my father and which comes naturally to me is my favorite medium says the artist although his father died when he was only an infant of four enof much wonwu recalls carving with him his father an engineer who in retirement turned sculptor was also his first model bom july   at onitsha eastern nigeria benedict chuka enwonwu who prefers to be called ben carved his own toys as a youngster and recalls his mothers  discomfort over his littering the grounds with chips after cutting bamboo and egbo as he fashioned the reverend fathers and fashionable ladies these along with the toy motor cars houses schools churches and government offices he sculpted constituted the little world he created a world he chose to call man labeling his activity useless his grandmother attempted to dissuade him but young ben was persistent she soon left him alone when she observed that i was obsessed with this preoccupation says mr enwonwu speaking of those early days of creativity tivity of he adds man was the daily acan absorbing daily activity i did not in fact know what an artist was or what makes up an artist hence my development in the various directions of recreative activities in which what was primary was to mould a world of my own in which my creative exercises centered while attending the holy trinity roman catholic school in onitsha young bens artistic interests continued he began modeling tea cups and saucers of clay and tracing mango leaves he carved in elmwood and indian mango and it was  during this period that he began exploring the possibilities of alabaster and bronze scholarly as well as creative he was transferred at the age of  to the government college at ibadan nigeria still colonialized at that time his talent was encouraged and he proceeded to the government college at umiahia where he graduated in  the college immediately hired him as art master and at  mr enwonwu was on the brink of a fame that is now internationally acclaimed subsequently promoted to the position of art instructor he traveled from school to school in eastern nigeria starting art classes all the while developing and nourishing his art his first oneman exhibition was held in benin early in  but the initial boon in a career that would soon soar was a oneman exhibition in lagos in december of the same year this showing resulted in his being sent to oxford university in england under the cosponsorship of an english businessman and the nigerian government he studied at the slade school of art and in  received the diploma in fine art from london university mr enwonwu did postgraduate work in social anthropology and ethnography and in  was made a fellow of the royal anthropological institute the berkeley galleries was the scene of his first oneman london show and was followed by a presentation at heals mansard galleries the year concluded with an appointment as art advisor to the nigerian government which made the year  indeed a big one for mr enwonwu as art advisor he was instrumental in setting up art schools throughout nigeria his duties included inspecting the teaching of art and lecturing he frequently junketed to europe to keep abreast of developments in art but he also devoted ample time to his still ripening talent although his works began gaining recognition in the united states in the late forties it was in the fall of  that he first visited this country under the auspices of the harmon foundation on october   he opened with a oneman show at howard university and won the warm approval of washington art lovers following his success at howard mr enwonwu journeyed to boston with his works and appeared at the schweitzer foundation festival an exhibition at roosevelt house in new york sponsored by hunter college was the next stop for the visiting artist at roosevelt house mr enwonwu displayed his exhibit of oil gouache and water color paintings and wooden sculptureshe is considered to be one of the few living expert wood carversand especially fascinated patrons with his painting of olisa the god of gods olisa described by mr enwonwu as powerful and calm in his wisdom was painted from recollection of stories his grandmother had told him his american tour in high gear mr enwonwu set off for exhibitions at vassar college syracuse university and bennington college his tour included two lectures at new york university and lectures and art discussions at adelphi college on long island and at other schools returning to nigeria he continued work in the civil service and oneman exhibitions which took him to the capitols of europe the fifties brought many awards and commissions attesting to his increased recognition in  mr enwonwu became a member of presence africaine at paris and attended the conference on world negro culture two years later the same year he carved the statue of the risen christ for the university of ibadan chapel one of his principal works he was awarded the insignia of mbe member of the british empire for his contribution to nigerian art and culture the famous bronze piece called anyanwu which was hailed by the late sir jacob epstein as symbolizing the rise of african countries towards nationhood was produced by mr enwonwu in  the year of nigerian independence today it adorns the entrance to the nigerian museum one of the highlights of the enwonwu career came in  when he was given a studio in buckingham palace to carry out the commission from the nigerian government for a bronze portrait of her majesty queen elizabeth ii the highly acclaimed work now can be viewed in front of the nigerian senate chambers the bennett prize of the royal society awarded to one person every three years for the encouragement of arts manufacturing and commerce for the commonwealth countries was presented to ben enwonwu in  the sculptor to whom art has been a lifelong dedication recalls  as a dark period beclouded with the cultural problems of nigeria he insists that culture and the artist were denied the proper priority during the quest for political freedom and direction the artist was forgotten as nigerianisation of the civil service began says mr enwonwu art became a thing to be used as a convenience rather than a necessity for the projection of the nigerian image in spite of the dark period the artist continued to work in  president nnamdi azikiwe sat for him in london and he created a statue in bronze two years later in torino italy mr enwonwu sculpted a second statue of the nigerian president one of the more popular of his numerous murals is located in the nigerian ports authority building the mural was painted in holland in  cultural missions to india germany and ghana occupied much of  and  has been a busy year for mr enwonwu the inspection of nigerian foreign missions took him to london bonn and rome and in the spring brought him to this country once again new york and washington were included on this cultural mission for the ministry of external affairs projection of the nigerian image a phrase that owes special homage to mr enwonwu was at the heart of the mission the artist seeks to promote the nigerian image through the decoration of our embassies with nigerian works of art he says that the mission was a success but adds that due to the influence of tribalism on the arts in nigeria ministerial authorities concerned with the promotion of art and culture would rather assign the responsibility for projecting nigerian art abroad to young and inexperienced administrative officers mr enwonwu expects that these young officers will represent his country at the world festival of negro arts to be held in dakar senegal next spring even though the festival was first discussed in nigeria in my studio between president leopold senghor and myself while the senegalese president was on an official visit to nigeria nevertheless the sensitive artist looks to the future he plans to establish a private art gallery in lagos for the purpose of promoting evaluating and developing the right kind of aesthetic attitude and philosophy of african art the art gallery might necessitate his resigning from the civil service but mr enwonwu will be able to recall glowing years in the service of his country as art advisor the gallery will be named omekaodigwe enwonwu in memory of his father it will says enwonwu tackle all the problems of cultural art and so the imagination that flowered in youth flowers in fame that which was called useless activity became genius magnified by depth spirit and endless energy a man an artist recalls his lifetime and remembers his early inspiration and alas pursues his early love
malcolm_x was a great man few recognized his greatness when he lived some have come to recognize it now many will be compelled to recognize it in the future but with the publishing of the autobiography of malcolm_x grove press  no matter how one has thought of him there is no longer an excuse for the ignorant belief that malcolm_x was the devil incarnate who deserved his violent death and whose absence makes the world a better place after malcolm_xs murder carl rowan an american of african descent who was at that time director of the united states information agency expressed dismay at the foreign presss clamorous attention to the murder of an unschooled black man in harlem as the creature of the politicians who had presented him his job rowan assured the world that malcolm_x represented no more than a tiny minority of the negro population of america and then scornfully holding up the clippings from newspapers throughout the world he continued all this about an exconvict exdope peddler who became a racial fanatic i can only conclude that    the need to inform world opinion is even greater than we in usia thought it to be think of that incident one american black manhonored by his nations journalists and promoted to public office by the president of the united statesdenigrating a fellow black american who was excoriated by his nations press men and considered unworthy of the serious attention of the political and economic leaders of the united states that incident was a dramatization of the bitter black paradox the american dilemma which black man will finally become honored in this country the black man with some intelligence but little vision allied with those whites who would falsify the truth about this country in order to maintain the artifice of a good image or the black man who refuses to perch precariously on the horns of the race racist dilemma who faces the horns grapples with evil even if it means his death carl rowan or malcolm_x which one do you think will go down as a hero of his times before you decide do what mr rowan did not dofind out the truth about that exconvict exdope peddler no man has more acutely described and analyzed the existential political social moral and spiritual plight of a victimized people than has malcolm_x in this book no man has painted a truer picture of the afroamericans life style from midwestern farmlands to the suburbs and ghettos of big cities no man has thrown the segregationists bigots and hypocrites lies back into their teeth with greater intelligence wit defiance bravery and inflexible honor than did malcolm_x in his life and in this book no man has so irrefutably demonstrated that the race racist problem of this country should not be restricted to the reasonable speed of leadfooted american justice but rather exposed to the moral conscience of the rest of the world through open discussions in the united nations his life was full of changesfrom farmboy to high school dropout and on to zoot suits burglary dope taking dope peddling racketeering adultery and prison and in prison the crucible in which american society ritually burns out the residual dignity of its outcasts malcolm_x became converted to a new way of life through elijah muhammad of the thenobscure nation of islam and from that day on he was inflamed with the desire for knowledge and power to help his fellow black americans no man has risen from his societys dunghills to shine with more purity of purpose to scorch the blinking eyes of those who would not see a nation continually perpetuating a racist crime and to illuminate the paths of retribution more brilliantly than did malcolm_x no man can tell of a profounder transformation  and growth of intellectual social and moral consciousness than does malcolm_x who addressing students and faculty of harvard university gazed out a window at a house which served as his hideout when he was big red a burglar no man has been more foully maligned in his own country even by his own people but more warmly admired and respected and honored by enlightened statesmen and citizens of africa the middle east and many other countries than malcolm_x he was an angry man but a kind one and he foretells his own death in this book with neither selfpity nor conceit nor malice no mans life is like anothers but the lives of some men men uniquely endowed with intelligence courage honesty and moral vision and fittingly present during a critical moment in history acquire a transcendent significance to all who survive them malcolm_x was such a man that is what makes the autobiography of malcolm_x a book which must be read especially by the colored people of the world for unlike many other afroamerican spokesmen especially literary ones malcolm_x does not write with a white audience in mind near the end of his life when he went to mecca and became elhajj malik elshabazz he no longer embraced racial hatred or separatism yet he realized that the whites of the western nations might not readily give up their delusions of superiority and habits of oppression and he saw that only through the unity of colored peoples can there begin the transforming of an evil world to a better one not until black americans realize that it is the murder of malcolm_x and not of john f kennedy which will prove to be the most untimely and tragic death of this century not until that time will black americans nity as malcolm_x didjohn woodbegin to rise up in strength and dig ford 
three years ago just lll before my anthology hhl beyond the blues was hh published i gave a lecs turerecital of and about poetry by afroamericans on bbc british broadcasting corp radio in london england among the fan mail following that broadcast was a particularly interesting letter because in the name at the bottom of the page i recognized the author of a novel  about neonazis in presentday southern germany about that book the author himself wrote in a later letter lightweight stuff but not unthinking and i use these facts as an introduction to the man who said in that first letter to me as a writer and a liberal amer   ican southerner i was most interested in your fascinating talk on american negro poets last friday are there any anthologies where these poets works may be found i was particularly taken with the verses of county cullens spelling which you read now in the almost  years during which i have delved into the poetry of afroamericans and the many years of astonishment at the americans ignorance of the riches rejected and wasted countee cullen was one name that used to come to the fore even in the minds of very badly informed citizens of the usa here was the moment for me to say yet do i marvel     i marvelled also at the writers use of capital letters which i have left as originally written so i wrote my liberal american southern colleague a note thanking him and giving him a list of then available anthologies especially recommending langston hughes and arna bon temps the poetry of the negro which was published in  doubleday and was for many years the source of information on our subject together with countee cullens own excellent anthology caroling dusk published by harper in  i also mentioned alain lockes the new negro published in  by boni in new york the negro caravan selected by sterling a brown arthur p davis and ulysses lee which appeared in  dryden press that i thought would do for a beginners reading i enclosed a copy of eric walrond s and my selection of negroamerican poems black and unknown bards the package was rewarded with another letter from the recipient black and unknown bards arrived this morning and i have been dipping into it i find the poems for the most part almost unbearably good the underlining is mine rep and i mean that literally one gets the impression that the only really good modern poets who have something worthwhile to say and say it decently and with force are negroes an impression which i find distressingly poignant i am quoting my liberal american southerner at such length another startling paragraph from his letter is still to followbecause he voices honestly the same things about which critics have been beating about the bush for decades in fact his remarks reveal the true reasons why other writersliberal or unliberal northern eastern western or southern americans have kept the afroamerican poet outside the mainstream of american literature not because nonwhite americans cannot write but because they can and that is the distressing thing this ability this genius these qualities which make negroes men among men artists among artists in a world which does not want to recognize these truths it is as simple or as complicated as that the appreciation of art is an entirely subjective matter tastes in art are subject to fashion subject to socioeconomic circumstances to trends of the time and in the final analysis it is the consumer who decides whether he likes the article or doesnt art to me is something that awakens within me a specific sort of awareness if a picture a poem a piece of music any artistic product does this i call it art that is to say i myself decide whether or not something is art no objective criterion exists that applies to the ordinary man as well as to the professional critic the awareness which i mentioned before we may best compare with love if i meet someone who arouses in me that definite yet inexplicable awareness i say that i love that person when i am seized with this emotion the word beauty comes to my mind but in their essence love and art have nothing to do with beauty a poet need not write about beautiful pretty or glamorous things to create in his  reader that specific awareness either his work appeals to me or not that is the dilemma of the art critic he must judge what he adores or abhors and he must share his emotions with others american critics almost without any exceptions have until very very recently been nonnegroes the vast majority of them have not yet learned to see afroamerican writers as just writers the critics consider subject matter first when it concerns that specific group of creative artists in the same way as concert critics used to speak of the negro contralto or the negro tenor before they gave fair criticism to the artists vocal and especially professional achievements oddly enough in the field of the performing arts the prejudiced mind worked the other way round negroes were supposed to be good singers by right of birth consideration in respect of their training and professionalism did not enter into the critics reviews and there we are on the same level as still prevails in respect to literary criticism it is remarkable that my letter writer does see the tremendous qualities of negro poets that he does feel the power and impact of their work that it arouses in him that specific awareness but  he cannot love and that i am deeply sorry to state is perhaps the clue to the entire problem of the negro poet and his judges ray durem said it so painfully true i know im not sufficiently obscure to please the criticsnor devious enough imagery escapes me i cannot find those mild and gracious words to clothe the carnage blood is blood and murders murder whats a lavender word for lynch that makes me sit up all right that does give me that specific awareness and it shocks me as it must have shaken many a critic however without the ability to love that critic will not call ray durems poem art i i i   right through the long history of negro writing in the united states critics in certain periods recognized a limited a very limited number of poets    all of these responded to the preconceived idea of the negro all of them represented some aspect of the negro stereotype and i am audacious enough to maintain this situation is still with us to a large extent only specialists and there are preciously few of them would know that black americans have contributed to the countrys formal poetry i use the term in contrast to folk poetry as early as miss lucy terrys account of an attack by indians in  and that jupiter hammons evening thought in  was the first published poem by a negro the first afroamerican of whom american literature takes note is phillis wheatley an able poet but certainly not a militant or raceconscious lady miss wheatley  kidnapped from africa at the age of eight sold into the ownership of the liberal and religious john wheatley became a genteel late eighteen century young lady and as a poet modelled herself on pope and milton unmistakably she had talent and craftsmanship although she allowed her teachers and society to remake her completely she sacrificed her personality to the wish to be one of them no wonder that white america wasand isready to accept that good intelligent grateful african girl she died free impoverished of tb at the age of  none but the minute band of experts knows lyrical and freedomloving moses horton or daniel payne or charles reason or ann plato or alberry whitman or sincere tender militant frances ellen harper or any other negro abolitionist poet the one america does know is paul laurence dunbar but what part of his work have the white critics accepted the dialect poetry of course dunbar was a master of it of course his lyrics sing out his people live his cornbread smells most appetizingly but dunbar was not a southerner his mother was and she taught him the regional language nor was he a man of the country dunbar wanted to live by his pen his own people were still largely illiterate and those who could read and write didnt have the money to buy books so his audiencein fact his customerswere white america and to please them to make them sit up and listen he deliberately chose the kind of poetry that made him famous in their world for their sake he wore the mask that grins and lies as he himself wrote   in dunbar we have another good negro who presented himself as a stereotype although he left the world a magnificent heritage of four novels a great number of short stories and hundreds of nondialect poems when he died at the age of   the next in that short and very slim column of dark americans who made it in general anthologies occasionally appear in school textbooks and whose names more than just people with wayout interests know is james weldon johnson poet essayist collector of spirituals author of a book that shook his epoch the autobiography of an excolored man editor of the book of american negro poetry  with its daring introduction on the negros creative genius and what of his work do we find among specimens of negro poetry a word i hate anyhow theres poetry by negroes but theres no negro poetry neither white nor red nor yellow the creation and god stepped out into space and saidim lonely ill make me a man   now isnt that cute arent those coloured folk simpleminded arent they religious too i just love to hear them sing theyve all of them such beautiful voices  ad lib do they taste the poetry of those sermons no they dont do they sense the tenderness no question about it they see the odd primitive adorably childish preacher rolling his eyes toward heaven for their entertainment thats why the creation has made it do those who acclaim it know the great james weldon johnsons other work you bet they dont i even know negroes who dont realize that lift every voice is his poem and the songs magnificent tune his brothers then comes the harlem renaissance scores of names tons of talent one of those who then was a youngster has really made it langston hughes now called the dean of negro writers a man whose work has been translated into practically every living language have a look in anthologies of american poetry comb through books of poetry for american secondary schools and what do you find mother to son dont misunderstand me i like the poem its a remarkable piece it communicates with people of many nations and races but that mother is as white america expects a good negro a hard working slaving woman who just wants her boy to be good too and carry on she doesnt protest seewe all know thats how negroes live they actually enjoy their lives that way colored folk dont really want to live otherwise thats how they are the scope of this article does not permit me to carry my point too far i could easily apply it to prose writings too from richard wright to james baldwin the critics of negro writing extract from it that which they have all the time expected they judge by way of subject matter not by general literary standards if there are any or by their specific awareness because there is no level of individual communication other than the mentioned negative one because there is no love my listener and letter writer knows that and it frightens him listen to him again will your new anthology beyond the blues include the poems in this one black and unknown bards i rather think it would be better to leave out any spirituals as this is the sort of thing one expects from negroes and although charming is not startling anymore whereas the poems have a great impact part of which is the fact that they are not at all the sort of thing one associates with negroes my correspondent may get some more shocks when he discovers that many of those charming spirituals were in fact coveredup songs of protest i told him so in my reply and a few things more for instance that negroes are not curios but human beings with creative abilities perhaps not better certainly not worse than others but at least on a level with the rest of the human race blindness to that simple statement is the very root of that disgusting attitude of the critic toward negro writing some people on this earth are as mari evans says in her poem fling me your challenge incontrovertibly and most magnificently black some of these also are poets writers of all the world will express best that which is truly theirs that which they experience so deeply so painfully whether it be love or hatred that it wants to press itself out of their system almost like in childbirth the german poet goethe   meant something which also affects negro writing as it affects all writing of all times when he said you cant get rid of what is truly yours even if you were to throw it away he also wrote poetic content is the content of ones own life and his compatriot philosopher schopenhauer  put it like this style is the physiognomy of the mind and a safer index to character than the face or the colour of ones skin rep authors or editors are only human and human beings like praise recently my anthology beyond the blues was praised by a famous critic for being the best anthology of negro verse ever published however i reject praise that was given for the wrong reasons in the same way that critics of past generations liked the work of negro stereotypes or as they interpreted the works in terms of their own minds which were unable to see negroes other than as stereotypes the presentday critic will acclaim black authors who make the reader forget they are black again it is the subject matter that counts first not the writers artistic ability the new trend is as bad as the old 
prather davis p £ forced himself not to f limp as he followed his  mother out of the elevator across the lobby of the crowded police station his right knee was throbbing like a toothache from his many falls during the demonstration and he could feel warm blood snaking down his leg he was ten years old and he was hot tired and hungry he swallowed hard and hurried after his mother who cut a path through the milling demonstrators and sternfaced policemen to his left he saw a group of singing clapping demonstrators being herded through a revolving door into the police station the singing washed over him and he paused that thing in him which had settled down while he had been upstairs in juvenile detention now began to rise again it started in his stomach whirling about and rose to his throat choking him slowly he started toward the demonstrators but after a few steps his mother grabbed his hand and led him firmly out of the building going down the street prather frowned he wished his mother wouldnt hold his hand and lead him like he was a child but the hard tapping of her heels and the straight set of her shoulders made him hold his peace he glanced up at her face and seeing the tight line of her mouth he knew that just one more straw and either hot tears or hot words would pour from her so ignoring the pain in his knee he quickened his pace he heard the shrill blast of a policemans whistle and up ahead he saw a policeman in white gloves directing traffic a sleek sports car zoomed by and his eyes followed it lovingly a black police van turned the corner and from inside it he heard demonstrators singing and clapping again that thing started churning in his stomach and rose to his throat he tightened his hand around his mothers fingers and thought about this thing in his throat that choked him he choked from it whenever he heard his brother a philip who had been named after that big pullman porter man and who had come home this summer from fisk with a beard talk about civil_rights and freedom and the l a dodgers he choked from it when  he played checkers with his father in the evenings after supper and when his father would tell him about the different cities to which his railroad waiters job had taken him before that accident two years ago had crippled him for life prather remembered when his father used to bring him presents he would rush to his father for it but his father would hold it high in the air he would have to climb upon a chair then onto his fathers shoulders before he could reach the present his mother would stand by nervously telling his father to quit the foolishness but his father would laugh and say let him learn to reach and today during the demonstration that thing had choked him with a philip holding his hand he was marching and feeling good when the confusion began the police had come with horses and water hoses and swinging billysticks somebody shoved him and he fell skinning his knee he scrambled to his feet looking for his brother but a philip had disappeared he heard people screaming and praying and horses hooves ringing and fire hoses swishing somebody was shouting over a loudspeaker and cameras were flashing and popping suddenly he was slammed to the pavement lights blinked behind his eyes and air gushed from his lungs as he lay with the world spinning about him someone lifted him and carried him to a police van now this thing was still in his throat as they reached the parking lot his mother let go of his hand and fumbled in her purse for the car keys finding them she turned inspecting him silently her eyes large and luminous then slowly she held out her arms the thing in his throat expanded and burst he ran crying into her soft arms letting the sweet rose smell of her wash over him
the boy walked down the hill past the mess hall and into the valley he wore indian moccasins shorts rolled neatly half way up his thighs a white tshirt and a sailor hat pulled down all around through the trees ahead he could see the calm water of the lake a woodpecker knocked overhead and he stopped to locate it in the tall pines it was redheaded a big male moving clockwise around a tall pine about two thirds of the way up the cicadas were sounding their greek chorus and he could hear the crows cursing the fish hawk over the lake he moved towards the beach past the thick ivy on the valley floor to his right he stopped at the rail fence hed helped build a few summers ago and looked at the lake it was a mirror no breeze to ripple its surface the wooden pier moved out into the water its lshape reflected in its surface then the flash of a fish leaping for a bug far out in the lake and the smooth surface was broken he walked to the board with the name tags hanging on it and moved his tag from the section marked in from among the tags of the members of his troop to the section marked out hanging it on one of the hooks at the green painted symbol of canoe number three the boy walked to the racked canoes stepped out of his moccasins stooped and came up under number three a long old towne painted green he stood between the gunwales and shifted until he was at the balance point then straightened letting his legs lift it the canoe balanced on his hands he walked to the waters edge and into the lake until the water was at his calves  then aware of the eyes of the younger scouts who stood at the fence he pivoted half a turn to his left and allowed the canoe to turn over of its own weight lowering it to his extended left thigh he fed the bow into the water hand over hand lowered the stern gently to the sand and walked to the rack of paddles selecting one that came just to his chin he picked up a kneeling pad that he had filled with kapok and sewn the winter before and returned to the canoe pushing it into the lake as he stepped into it and knelt at the stern thwart the boy let the canoe glide the paddle across the gunwales as he moved past the sailboat it was a sixteen foot marconirigged sloop broad of beam and with a center board well suited for the long narrow lake he had furled the sails well that afternoon he would sail again tomorrow later that evening there would be the annual songfest in the mess hall after dinner scouts from the four camps at the lake  miles to the south had hiked north to hear them theirs was a singing camp and they were famous for it they sang everywhere on the trails in the dense woods when hiking around the camp fires in the mess halls in their boats and their tents at night his own troop was one of the best they might win the prize again that night for the second consecutive year the boy loved to sing and he looked forward to the evening he hummed one of his favorite songs as he jstroked lazily across the lake then he shifted his right leg from a kneeling position braced it against the side of the canoe in the racing stance digging in hard with the paddle picking up the beat the canoe leapt forward and he stroked hard until the water surged past and he began to sweat he rested the paddle across the canoe and looked astern at his wake and the whirlpools left by his paddle marring the surface of the lake he was proud of his skill on the waterfront as a swimmer with the canoe and rowboat as a life guard and in the sailboat the camp had opened a new world to him one not bounded by the dirty streets and alleys of chicago he stroked slowly toward the shallows at the other side of the lake the turtle hunting grounds watching the fish hawk circling sedately high above ignoring the crows as they divebombed him the crows offered no threat as long as he was healthy and the hawk knew it tomorrow the boy would bring two of the younger scouts across in the canoe to catch the turtles that swam and sunned in the shallows but today he wanted to be alone in the gathering dusk on the quiet lake the lake dropped off suddenly at that point and the turtles depended on the depths close at hand for protection but by keeping the canoe between the turtles and the deep water forcing them to swim parallel to the shore a wading scout could approach them from the rear reach into the water and capture them for the menagerie already full of snakes turtles and toads and frogs the boy would watch from the canoe as the younger scouts waded after the turtles and tell them when they were chasing a snapper they didnt know yet how to recognize the snappers or how to grab them without being bitten the snapping turtles were mean and often refused food in captivity so he let them swim into the depths of the lake he reached the shallows and watched six turtles scurry to the deep water he followed the shore to the end of the lake and then turned back towards camp it was time to return to his tent get his uniform from beneath the mattress where his body had pressed it the night before and shine his moccasins in time for the singing he let the younger scouts rack the canoe and then walked up the hill toward his campsite everywhere he could hear the scouts singing eager for the evenings music they were a singing camp later after the singing had finished still full of the songs and rhythm he walked from the mess hall with the crowd into the darkness of the michigan woods but he didnt return to his campsite he was still excited from the singing and he hoped their guests from the lake to the south had enjoyed it the scouts at the four camps there were from chicago too he had been to the camps there the year before for the ceremony initiating him into a higher order of the scouting fraternity he had noticed the difference in the facilities the cabins had raised concrete floors wooden sides and screening electric lights and hot and cold running water in the wash shed at each campsite at his own camp they slept in tents with wooden floors with no screening with kerosene lamps and washed in the morning in the icy water from the pump at the rustic wash racks they had built themselves they made their own mattresses from muslin to be filled with dried leaves or pine boughs or slept on the bare canvas stretched between the short springs of their bunks but their scoutmasters told them that theirs was a real camp and that they were better scouts for having to rough it and the boy believed it was true the singing had been good the best in his five summers at camp it had gotten better with each song and there had been the contest for the prize between his troop and their traditional neighborhood rivals they had not won but the voting had been close and then the two of them had sung three songs together the last a driving swinging spiritual and they had rocked the entire hall he still felt the song and although he knew that there would be more singing at campsite around a camp fire he walked on he wanted to talk to the visitors it was a black moonless night and he could not see very well coming from the mess hall which had been brightly lit with coleman lanterns but he could see the path marked with whitewashed boulders a group of scouts walked ahead and he joined them hi the boy said to one of the scouts how did you like the singing wonderful wonderful he replied it was just great its my first year in camp and everyone said how good it would be but it was even better my scoutmaster is right those niggers sure can sing there was light ahead at the entrance to the camp and the boy didnt want the scout from the camp to the south to see his face he stepped to the side of the path and allowed the group to move ahead and strangely he wasnt angry only very sad somehow he walked back to the hill and the path leading to his campsite he could hear them singing his troop  and their rivals  singing together the boy halted on the dark path halfway up the hill listening in the midst of the tall pines and big oaks the singing came to him filtered by the trees he stood there alone and listened then walked up the path and into the clearing of the campsite the two troops ringed the fire some sitting on the logs around it others on the sand he looked for the flag of his patrol the fox patrol and saw it stuck in the sand in front of the right members of the patrol the boy moved into the light of the fire and toward the flag he saw his friend in the midst of  and waved there was a breeze stirring they would have good sailing tomorrow he sat on the sand crosslegged next to the flag and listened awhile then he began to smile as the song filled him yes he thought as he sang he was right yes we can sing
history masks the faces and emotions of black men and women who lived in this racial wonderland the record burns with their presence but the record is strangely silent on their reactions and the reactions of their white colleagues the record becomes far less silent at the hands of a diligent historian in confrontation black and white johnson publishing co inc  from which the above is quoted lerone bennett jr writing in his lucid style fills more voids in this nations black and white experience than have previously been filled in any one book about a nation where the popular use of history has served to defend an ugly past maintain an evil system and to avert radical change the author writes there is no need really for us to continue to play the dreadful games of the professional race relationist the game of education we must educate negroes the game of appropriation we must improve the cultural standards of negroes the game of technique it is a very complicated problem we are not now nor have we ever been playing those games the game we are playing is racism mr bennett uses history to relate precisely what brought about the game and in bringing us from jamestown  to selma  he explains the creation of the game and the ramifications that led to the present conundrum he delves back into history and reveals the words and actions and reactions of those both black and white whose very lives and decisions are key links to an understanding of modern reality in racist america the author cites quotes from the past that relate to the present with almost frightening accuracy and relevancy one example is found in the  words of georgia white supremacist henry grady we have no fear of negro revolt already we are attaching to us the best elements of that race and as we proceed our alliance will broaden the latter thought being as true a prophecy as ever uttered in this country the need of white americans to dehumanize black americans is examined closely by mr bennett who writes slavery    did not spring from racism racism sprang from slavery the concept of race was a direct outgrowth of the slave trade    deliberately invented by an exploiting group which needed a theology to maintain and defend privileges founded on naked force  a need arose for justification of that which could not be justified by any theory in western thought confrontation black and white includes what is perhaps the most objective account of negro leadershipits successes and failuresto date including an examination of the shortcomings as well as the brilliance of men such as frederick douglass w e b du bois asa philip randolph and martin_luther_king in addition to these known leaders the author reveals the significance of lesser known men such as martin r delaney perhaps the first major american negro nationalist prior to the civil war and richard allen an early th century black man who recognized the necessity of power it is difficult to single out the books most significant contribution but students of negro revolt and protest will note the authors filling many voids of the forties in dealing with this period bennett the historian excels at his forte and casts light on a darkness that relates with great import to the movement of the fifties and sixties in doing so the author places in true perspective the role of a man who perhaps more than any other negro leader has been bypassed in terms of his significance and influence regarding the current surge of black americaasa philip randolph bennett the historian excels throughout the book and in a conclusion he calls uamerica face to face bennett the writer reveals not only amazing perception and insight but also the courage integrity and sheer audaciousness that is perhaps primary if one is to tell the truth about this country in no uncertain terms the author assesses the roles of americans who are in a race here between white hysteria and negro despair between fascism and democracy between america and america    we must make revolutionary changes at every level of our lives we must first of all abandon our frames of referencesall our frames of reference are vitiated by racist assumptions mr bennett insists that negro leadership must awaken the sleeping millions and he suggests that to do so is a challenge no national organization with the exception of sncc and the black nationalist groups has addressed itself to in a serious and sustained way he tells us that the only choice we have left is between an orderly confrontation and a disorderly one writing about the fifties he refers to a new breed of artists who came forth with a new frame of reference and a new sense of respect for themselves men and women like lorraine hansberry leroi jones john killens frank london brown hoyt fuller ossie davis miles davis ruby dee oscar brown    james baldwin    but such a list is incomplete if one fails to include a black historian from clarksdale mississippidavid llorens
those negroes over  might remember when robert penn warren one of the highlypraised group of southern writers which included allen tate back in the thirties and forties was saying in print that negroes were inferior human beings and that they would be better off to accept their lot and stop all the agitating and striving well this very same mr warren published a book this year called who speaks for the negro random house  and while he failed to answer his own question he let it be known that he hasnt changed his own stripes merely covered them over a bit mr warren used a tape recorder and went out interviewing negroes as high as roy wilkins and as low as an allbutilliterate black farmer in louisiana and it is plain that mr warrens favorite nigras were mr wilkins and the farmer mr wilkins for his great good sense and the farmer for his comfortable oldfashioned humility mr warren reserved his most blistering comments for the late malcolm_x and the redoubtable james baldwin which is par for the course and naturally all the yearend literary guides have selected mr warrens who speaks for the negro as one of the best books on the subject published durasserting that the murderers consider themselves and are widely regarded as patriots william bradford huie in  lives for mississippi wcc  writes this murder was no ordinary outrage committed by one human being against another and therefore against a state it was part of the continuing war between mississippi terrorists and the united states of america once this is understood comprehension of what happened may become easier thus the above statement best explains the authors theory regarding the murder of james chaney michael schwerner and andrew goodman in neshoba county mississippi during the summer of  the author proves himself a talented journalist and the result of his intensive researchespecially regarding the planning of the execution is a book that is quite informative mr huie also admits to hating what   the white supremacy terrorists are doing to negroes to the south and to the united states butdue in part perhaps to his outrage with his native souththe authors theory seems to relieve the nation of its responsibility for the fate of the three young men huie often refers to the terrorists believing that they were striking a blow against communism by murdering the three civil_rights workers and he cites the influence of southern politicians the cooperation of the mississippi police and the complicity of the community mississippi in arriving at his conclusion that the killers believed themselves patriots this reviewer would argue that responsibility for white mississippi rednecks fear of communismfear strong enough to make men kill cannot be confined within the borders of the magnolia state or for that matter even within the south in june of last year liberal illi nois senator paul douglas told a delegation that journeyed to the capitol to appeal for additional federal protection for the summer project of which i was a member of his fear of communism in connection with the summer project in his words you must remember that there are those who would choose to use you as sacrificial lambs on our return to oxford ohio only a few days after chaney schwerner and goodman were missing members of that same delegation who were scheduled to leave for southwest mississippi natchezmccomb were briefed by john doar of the justice department mr doar advised that we refrain from entering that area of mississippi because even we are afraid to go in there and i remind you he represented the united states government a government that sends men to their death and kills men in foreign lands under the guise of protecting freedom but pleaded helplessness in the face of protecting the freedom and the lives of civil_rights workers northern mayors and newspapers have consistently made accusations of communism when assailing local movements in their cities granted mr huie probably did not have access to all of the abovementioned insights but i think they relate not so abstractly as one might like to believe to the reality of what happened in neshoba county if we have created a climate whereby men pull triggers on innocent victims and think themselves patriots the entire country is guilty in the minds of many white men both north and south communism and niggers have become one and the same huac many northern politicians many northern newspapers and other national institutions as well as mississippi authorities have contributed to this dangerous paranoia if mr huie is to have us believe that these men believed themselves patriots then i would suggest that he deludes us by saying the men who planned and committed this murder thought they were acting not against the state of mississippi but for mississippi against the united states such a statement makes them mississippi patriots perhaps the murderers believed themselves exactly that but if we are to call them patriots the truth of our national life today forces us to call them american patriots the author informs us that the killers were after schwerner the jewboy with the beard and that chaney and goodman were just unfortunate victims perhaps that is correct but in discussing the nations reaction to the tragedy he fails to mention that this reaction was based on the fact that whites were murdereda fact which says something significant about this nation of which mississippi is a part in spite of much speculation and many missing linksunderstandably so in this case lives for mississippi is a book worth reading but like most books written by white men about the problem it is incomplete mr huie quotes a speech made by cores david dennis at a memorial service for james chaney in meridian mississippi and words from mr dennis speech best sum up this reviewers reaction to both the tragedy and the authors theory    and im going to tell you deep down in my heart what i feel right now if you go back home and sit down and take what these white men in mississippi are doing to us  if you take it and dont do something about it    then god damn your souls david llorens
