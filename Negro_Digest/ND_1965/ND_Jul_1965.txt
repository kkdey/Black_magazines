 bynow it is commonly assumed that the negro revolt is a protest of those wanting  hhdfl to become a part of the existing order to get in there so to speak or so our middleclass leaders have always proclaimed but is this actually true of the great mass of slumbound negroes they want to be free of the shackles of segregation and discrimination to be sure but do they really want to become a part of white middleclass society and if they do want to get in will it ever be possible for them to overcome the obstacles and boobytraps lining their path at every turn then too those northern riots last summer were they staged by a people too filled with despair and desperation over the incredibly slow pace of their surge toward equality or were they simply a blind striking back by those who know deep in their hearts theyre never really going to make it in there and what are our leaders saying now that the much talkedabout civil_rights bill has been passed for more than a year and harlem mississippi and alabama still stand intact and are as formidable as ever in our schools we now want quality not necessarily integration roy wilkins national secretary of the naacp was recently quoted as saying now if that isnt a rerun of the old separate but equal lie then theres no such thing as a rerun if that is going to be the naacps official position why on earth did we ever expend all that time money heartache and blood trying to do away with that centuryold stumbling block the simple fact is there can be no worthwhile quality education in a segregated school that was the naacps main thesis when it presented its case before the us supreme court in the early fifties and it is just as true today granted integrated education is not automatically quality education but it is that wellworn step in the right direction i suspect that what mr wilkins really meant is we want some education as opposed to the none most of our  ghettodwelling youngsters now get and admittedly some is usually better than none but some education never got anyone into harvard or bryn mawr or backwater u or even old roundthecorner tech and if you havent got into something somewhere after high school you are never going to make it in there to enjoy the good life of their affluent society not so long as your face is black that is whitney young executive director of the national urban league chided the newspapers not too long ago for the great todo they made when floyd patterson moved out of his exclusive home in a white neighborhood because none of the children would play with his kids said mr young stories such as these give a misleading picture of the actual situation plenty of white people get along fine with negroes in these communities of course that may be true but we really cant get too excited about whats happening with the plentyfew stop any five thousand negroes on any street and ask how many of their little friends are cavorting about in  mansions in lilywhite neighborhoods and be prepared for the blank stare or the big horse laugh and in the meanwhile as congress made ready to pass a votingrights bill dr_king continued making headlines as friend and foe lauded and disparaged his every move but votingrights bill or no many suns will set before the majority of all eligible negroes are registered and voting in the south and long before that comes to pass they will have learned what the northern negro has always known voting wont get you in there either for who can honestly say that there is really any real difference between a george wallace of alabama and a william scranton of pennsylvania in the spring of  billy scrantons troopers went to work on the heads of those chester demonstrators with as much if not more gusto and expertise as wallaces storm troopers did on dr_kings marchers in birmingham  or even the heinous selma setto of last spring and although more than  per cent of the negro vote was cast for lyndon johnson last november all too soon negroes are going to wake up to the fact that lbj hasnt changed one single spot hes simply talking out of a different side of his mouth nowadays as a master politician his strategy remains the same promise them everything the black muslims it seems cause white people an untold amount of worry and perhaps their concern is justified for privately most negroes agree with what the muslims are saying about white people however the muslims ultimate goal leaves most of us laughing or greatly perplexed after all we already live in a separate state that has always been our main complaint would malcolm_x have become the man with a plan at the time of his assassination last winter he seemed to be the only negro leader telling it like it is and as he told a group of students at dartmouth shortly before his death the summer of  will be the longest hottest bloodiest summer ever of course malcolm made a similar prediction in the winter of  only to have the heads of all the major northernbased civil_rights organizations lambast him for being absurd and that summer in philadelphia even after riots had occurred in new york and brooklyn one of the prominent negro judges called the city a tinderbox which was ready to explode as the other cities had done at the slightest provocation what cried the white hypocrites and their echoing uncle toms in pretended anguish our fair city of brotherly love a tinderbox reediculous then boom down came the roof burying them along with all their horrendous cliches interesting enough during or after the riot of  none of the daily papers seemed to make mention of the riot that had occurred only ten months previous when a rookie italian cop allegedly in selfdefense killed a young negro falsely accused of shoplifting as he lay on the pavement having an epileptic seizure and so it goes again and again and again as each depressing summer wears away the paperthin walls of hope for there is really no evidence of any change of attitude in the white power structure or steppedup efforts to make justice and equality a more tangible reality for our untouchables in no mans land and even if there were some signs of change this would only effect a temporary delay in the final confrontation to put it bluntly we will never overcome so long as our society is structured in the form of a pyramid as of now there is really not enough space for all white people to get in there and until all of them make it most of us will simply cool our heels in the ghetto amongst our old friendsthe rats and roaches and the clubwielding copsknowing that the great society is only a slogan and we shall overcome is merely a dream
my cousin is approaching the age when he will want to know if a negro is inferior if the fact has anything to do with his life to him life is a bright panorama of new sensations people and facts but the time is coming and it seems all too soon for he is a negro a child at present whose theoretically unlimited horizons will soon be limited by the american way of life ricky is a healthy boy of  who considers himself the man of the house since his father died he has a natural interest in men and masculine pursuits though he lives with his mother and grandmother he and i are like father and son for i try to fill that void in his life i am a glamorous figure to him a sergeant in the united states air force this in itself is a source of pride to him my travels job and life seem like an exciting adventure to him we spend  my yearly vacations together in new jersey i remember the trouble he was having at school one year the neighborhood gang of kids were beating the stuffing out of him his mother and grandmother were overprotecting him telling him to avoid fights and instead be a gentleman while i was there on leave his mother told me of his trouble at school ricky and i set aside a few hours each day and i taught him how to defend himself after winning his first school fight he acquired the aggressive spirit that is always a part of a man or boy some day confused and in doubt hell ask me are we really inferior to white people  the answer i give will be very important to him it will direct rickys life and ambitions as a negro a responsibility i owe rickys father who cant be present i hope it is spring when he asks the question for i want to take him outside the house to his favorite spot the grape arbor his father planted its quite pretty there sowell walk in the warm sunshine towards the arbor two negroes an adult and a youth ill be seated in the grape arbor lighting a cigarette slowly collecting my thoughts while ricky gathers some grapes to eat then there will be that inevitable pause and ill begin its a long story ricky the negro race has a long rich and glorious past second to no other race no ricky we arent inferior the exploring parties of the past that charted this land contained negroes negroes have been emperors kings popes and statesmen but most of all they have been proud men the forefathers of our family came to america in the hold of a slave ship you must not think we were weak stupid or savages we  fought escaped and many of us preferred death to a life of slavery our fathers built the south with their blood muscles and backs when you think of your slave background be proud your forefathers paid for your freedom they endured and in the end they won you are part of a proud family ricky we are from old virginia where your ancestors worked as slaves slavery for the american negro was awaiting its final death blow when your greatgreatgrandfather escaped from the plantation owner he wanted freedom so badly he accepted the risks of discovery and death when he was smuggled to the north on the underground railroad the underground railroad was the name of various escape routes for runaway slaves these slaves were hidden in homes wagons and forests as they traveled north to safety your greatgreatgrandfathers destination was a white quaker settlement in new jersey the quakers have long since died there but the settlement now a town still exists your greatgreatgrandfather spent his life there as a farmer its present name is the same springtown at the outbreak of the civil war your forefather joined the new jersey volunteers and served honorably as a soldiera front line soldierin the civil war each generation has had a military member since then your own father served in world war ii so you see ricky we have earned the right to live in this country i know i have not yet answered your question but i will now the white persons claim of our inferiority is usually based on a lack of understanding and knowledge a need to look down on others to feel good and what their own families have taught them the schoolmates who call you names and believe you are repulsive dont understand themselves remember that these are the same people who go to the beaches and try to darken their skin in the sun or wave their hair with chemicals i guess they want to be like us in their hearts our supposed inferiority is a myth just as the moon being made of green cheese is one if all their attempts to stop us from progressing were because we are inferior we would not have made progress but we have in spite of them in almost every job youll find a negro competing with a white man holding his own dont let talk destroy your dreams and ambitions remember that you will have to work and prepare yourself for your goals you may have to be twice as good as a white person but do it and you can have what you want in life also generation upon generation of negroes have done it before you now they are waiting for you to join them i hope the sun feels warm and life seems good when we start back for rickys home and his future life may he believe me as i believed his father one sunny day long ago

this year for the first time since the end of world war ii a buyers market exists in which the supply of homes exceeds the demand according to housing expert c w smith senior vice president of mortgage guaranty insurance corp the oversupply of homes the opportunities for the purchase of repossessed homes and the outlook for continued increases in taxes at the local and state levels plus increases in the cost of living can mean real dollar savings for those who buy homes now instead of waiting mr smith formerly director of the housing research foundation southwest research institute says one of the best ways the american family has of beating the inflationtax spiral is to buy as soon as possible with a small down payment the best home they can afford but if youre one of the millions of americans who dreams of owning a new home you probably share a common problem lack of a large down payment despite the existence of federal housing administration and veterans administration programs to encourage highratio loans of up to  per cent of appraised value it is expensive difficult and time consuming for home buyers to qualify further most conventional uninsured home loans are limited to  per cent of the homes appraised value thus you would need  cash to buy a  home in the past six years however the growth of private mortgage insurance has made it possible for lenders to safely make loans of up to  per cent of a homes value firms such as the mortgage guaranty insurance corp or mgic as it is known insure the mortgage through the lending institution and provide a low cost private enterprise alternative to government sponsored programs this one firm one of the largest of the private enterprise competitors of fha now insures home mortgages with over  institutions in  states and the district of columbia and presently has over one billion dollars worth of insurance in force the fha was developed during the depression in the early s to stimulate home ownership by encouraging the making of higher ratio home loans to home buyers by protecting mortgage lenders against loss and widening the marketability of mortgage loans as an investment the va program was instituted to similarly guarantee mortgage loans for exservicemen although both fha and va have made substantial contributions to the field of housing finance in the s restrictions and procedural delays began to meet with resistance and mortgage lenders increasingly turned to conventional loans for one thing the interest rate ceilings imposed by congress now set at va per cent for both fha and va penalize home buyers by forcing investors to purchase loans at a discount to secure an adequate return the discount unlike an interest rate is not tax deductible neither can it be reduced by prepayment or financing prior to private insuring of mortgages a buyer seeking conventional financing who could afford to make only a low down payment might have had to resort to expensive secondary financing if a lender for example required a  per cent down payment and the prospective buyer could afford only  per cent he would have to take out a second mortgagein effect a loan for part of the down paymentat a high rate of interest this would be a short term loan of say three to five years and would frequently require a large final payment the buyer might not be prepared to meet moreover second mortgages are sold for discounts of up to  per cent another item which is ultimately reflected in the price the buyer pays for his home in contrast a privately insured mortgage can be as high as  per cent of the propertys appraised value and the cost amortized over its full term private mortgage insurance is considerably less costly than that of government programs some offer rates of about half that charged by the fha fha charges vi of one per cent per year on the declining balance for the life of the loan whereas mgics premium for example is only v of one per cent for the first year and va of one per cent for subsequent years many private mortgage insurance firms offer single payment plans of two per cent of the insured loan for the first  years of coverage speed is also an important consideration for both sellers and buyers applicants for privately insured mortgages usually receive an answer within  hours of receipt of the application as a result of efficient cooperation between these private firms and lending institutions whereas processing commitments under governmental programs can be very time consuming a generation ago it was neces sary for families to save as much as onethird of the price of a home before buying since the maximum available loans were about twothirds the cost of a house today even though you may be financially able to put down  per cent to  per cent it may be wiser to buy with only  per cent down you can achieve your goal of providing your family with better living conditions sooner without unduly depleting your savings liquidating income producing investments or resorting to high cost secondary financing the buyer also usually has movingin expenses such as major appliances draperies carpeting and other household equipment by purchasing these items for cash with savings from a lower down payment the new owner avoids the high interest rates for short term credit and burden of additional payments a lower down payment allows him to amortize all his outlays over the period of his mortgage at a lower interest rate than would otherwise be available if we continue to experience gradual inflation the buyer will be able to repay the loan over a period of years with a greater number of cheaper dollars furthermore deductions can be made on the federal income tax return for loan interest and real estate taxes which further offset the larger mortgage finally ease of resale is a strong argument for buying a house with a small down payment want to sell your home when youre ready to trade up to a bigger home or must move to a new areaassuming the credit of the buyer is goodthe house with the larger mortgage will sell faster there will be more potential buyers who can meet the smaller down payment requirement as housing costs and living exm penses riselimiting buyers opportunities to accumulate savings for down paymentsthe demand for high ratio loans is expected to increase private mortgage insurance firms will enable conventional lending institutions to expand their services to meet home buyers demandsthus providing a continuing stimulus to the national housing economy
the war on poverty has been the recipient of a great deal of coverage from all the various mass communication media almost all of us have heard of it but just what does it have to offer will it be like so many other large government programs in that the very people it was designed to aid might be left out because they really dont know how to avail themselves of its benefits it is hoped that this presentation will answer some of the general questions and present enough of a basis for interested negroes to discover just what the war on poverty can mean to them the major thrusts of the war on poverty are being directed by the office of economic opportunity of the executive office of the president the present director is r sargent shriver of the peace corps this organization was set up under the economic opportunity act of  the act was passed last august and the money funded to the agency in october the original request from the presidents office was for  million but the congress cut the actual award to  million the request for the coming fiscal year will be one and one half billion dollars its obvious that there is already a great deal of money allocated for the poverty program and all indications point to an increase in such funds how does all of this affect the negrothe major drive of the program is to aid in eradicating poverty negroes have a higher per capita rate in the poverty category than any other ethnic group the natural consequence of this could be that the negro will benefit more per capita than any other ethnic group but in order to spell out in greater detail just how negroes can benefit it will be necessary to review the various provisions of the economic opportunity act itself a summary of the economic opportunity act of  the director has a planning and coordinating staff responsible for coordinating the povertyrelated programs of all government agencies within the oeo separate staffs operate a job corps a program for volunteers in service to america vista a community action program and special programs for migrant workers in addition the oeo distributes funds to existing agencies to operate other programs authorized under the bill worktraining programs administered through the labor department workstudy programs and adults basic education through hew special rural antipoverty programs through agriculture small business loans through the small business administration and community work and training projects for welfare recipients through hew following is a summary of the programs authorized under the economic opportunity act of  title iyouth programs  there are certain inherent dynamics of the program as it now stands that make it particularly timely for negroes to avail themselves of the benefits from it the first being that both president johnson and the director r sargent shriver are known for their rather liberal attitudes both are aware that any such program that is geared to stamp out poverty has to have extraordinary significance forand contact withthe negro but knowing this they both supported and pushed for the program which of course takes them out of the area of theoretical liberals into the area of practicing liberals the upshot of it all is that negroes can expect most favorable consideration insofar as the top leaders of the program are concerned another dynamic of the program that makes it advantageous for negroes to act now stems from the fact that the office of economic opportunity didnt get its funds until october and thus is still in the process of organizing and must commit its present funds by june  the end of the government fiscal year the result of this peculiar set of circumstances and pressures is that money is being awarded rather liberally to almost any legitimate program proposal another factor that works in the favor of favorable disposition of requests now is the fact that no hard and fast rules have been established as yet there are no precedents from former programs or those set by experience since there have never been any such previous programs the officials of the program are literally operating by the seat of their pants there are just two areas where the negro seeking aid might encounter difficulty there are some cities where the local government has chosen to act as the distributing agency for the government funds this means local government control of funds and the liberal aspect of the wards might be decreased or increased depending upon the convictions of the local government officials in addition to this there are usually conservative elements of the business community who bring pressure to bear against such programs this can be quite effective in cases where local administrators of the funds are susceptible to such pressures the second area of difficulty arises around the legitimacy and adequacy of the program proposed and the ability of the group involved to demonstrate that they have assets totaling  per cent of the amount requested but assuming that a group of interested citizens have a serious and well planned proposal that meets a definite need of their community in the pertinent areas listed under the various titles then they should encounter no great difficulty in getting fair consideration for their proposals i say this even though i mentioned previously that there might be cases where conservative forces are at work these elements can be discounted a bit at this time because like the federal agency the local agency also has to award its money in order to get more for the next fiscal year so it behooves them to forget conservative considerations in the interest of anticipated increases in funds having attempted to show that generally speaking such funds are readily available to negroes the next step would be to explain something of the mechanics involved in getting the money the proposed organization must be a private nonprofit organization or a part of the existing local government structure in the case of a private group they would have to incorporate themselves as a private nonprofit agency the next step would be to organize the goals and ideals that the group wishes to accomplish following this should be a budget that would list the amount of funds needed to execute the proposed program for the next year all of this and other pertinent data should be submitted to the federal or local government agency handling the program heading under which the project falls in the case of the federal agency the usual procedure is for the agency to review the request and deciding favorably on it it would then make a small program development grant which would allow the new group to get better organized and consult with a counselor trom the agencyinquestion about the proposed program after this hurdle has been successfully cleared there usually follows a grant for the remainder of the approved request this is called a conduct and administration grant now the group is in business as previously mentioned the organizing group must show that it has assets of  per cent of the total requested this doesnt necessarily have to be in the nature of cash it can be any tangible asset like equipment office space or free talent at the present the  per cent aspect is rather liberally interpreted for two years the government will award up to  per cent of the funds after two years the government at its discretion can maintain this  relationship but more usually the relationship will gravitate to  more exact and detailed advice and information can readily be gotten from the agency that administers the area under which the proposed program falls but now is definitely the most favorable time for negroes to attempt to get their proper portion of help under this program there are certain factors that are operating now that will eventually resolve themselves and accompanying them may also be the more liberal elements that now exist here is an opportunity for negro organizations to begin to take care of their own problems it is an unparalleled opportunity for negroes to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and compassion for their own people how long this chance remains with us depends on how effectively and dramatically we make our desires known and feltnow why wait
the late insurrection in southampton has greatly excited the public mind and led to a thousand idle exaggerated and mischievous reports it is the first instance in our history of an open rebellion of the slaves and attended with such atrocious circumstances of cruelty and destruction as could not fail to leave a deep impression not only upon the minds of the community where this fearful tragedy was wrought but throughout every portion of our country in which this population is to be found public curiosity has been on the stretch to understand the origin and progress of this dreadful conspiracy and the motives which influences its diabolical actors the insurgent slaves had all been destroyed or apprehended tried and executed with the exception of the leader without revealing anything at all satisfactory as to the motives which governed them or the means by which they expected to accomplish their object every thing connected with this sad affair was wrapt in mystery until nat turner the leader of this ferocious band whose name has resounded throughout our widely extended empire was captured this great bandit was taken by a single individual in a cave near the residence of his late owner on sunday the thirtieth of october without attempting to make the slightest resistance and on the following day safely lodged in the jail of the county his captor was benjamin phipps with a shot gun well charged nats only weapon was a small light sword which he immediately surrendered and begged that his life might be spared since his confinement by permission of the jailor i have had ready access to him and finding that he was willing to make a full and free confession of the origin progress and consummation of the insurrectory movements of the slaves of which he was the contriver and head i determined for the gratification of public curiosity to commit his statements to writing and publish them with little or no variation from his own words that this is a faithful record of his confessions the annexed certificate of the county court of southampton will attest they certainly bear one stamp of truth and sincerity he makes no attempt as all the other insurgents who were examined did to exculpate himself but frankly acknowledges his full participation in all the guilt of the transaction he was not only the contriver of the conspiracy but gave the first blow towards its execution it will thus appear that whilst every thing upon the surface of society wore a calm and peaceful aspect whilst not one note of preparation was heard to warn the devoted inhabitants of woe and death a gloomy fanatic was revolving in the recesses of his own dark bewildered and overwrought mind schemes of indiscriminate massacre of the whitesschemes too fearfully executed as far as his fiendish band proceeded in their desolating march no cry for mercy penetrated their flinty bosoms no acts of remembered kindness made the least impression upon these remorseless murderers men women and children from hoary age to helpless infancy were involved in the same cruel fate never did a band of savages do their work of death more unsparingly apprehension for their own personal safety seems to have been the only principle of restraint in the whole course of their bloody proceedings and it is not the least remarkable feature in this horrid transaction that a band actuated by such hellish purposes should have resisted so feebly when met by the whites in arms desperation alone one would think might have led to greater efforts more than twenty of them attacked dr blunts house on tuesday morning a little before daybreak defended by two men and three boys they fled precipitately at the first fire and their future plans of mischief were entirely disconcerted and broken up escaping thence each individual sought his own safety either in concealment or by returning home with the hope that his participation might escape detection and all were shot down in the course of a few days or captured and brought to trial and punishment nat has survived all his followers and the gallows will speedily close his career his own account of the conspiracy is submitted to the public without comment it reads an awful and it is hoped a useful lesson as to the operations of a mind like his endeavoring to grapple with things beyond its reach how it first became bewildered and confounded and finally corrupted and led to the conception and perpetration of the most atrocious and heartrending deeds it is calculated also to demonstrate the policy of our laws in restraint of this class of our population and to induce all those entrusted with their execution as well as our citizens generally to see that they are strictly and rigidly enforced each particular community should look to its own safety whilst the general guardians of the laws keep a watchful eye over all if nats statements can be relied on the insurrection in this county was entirely local and his designs confided but to a few and these in his immediate vicinity it was not instigated by motives of revenge or sudden anger but the results of long deliberation and a settled purpose of mind the offspring of gloomy fanaticism acting upon materials but too well prepared for such impressions it will be long remembered in the annals of our country and many a mother as she presses her infant darling to her bosom will shudder at the recollections of nat turner and his band of ferocious miscreants believing the following narrative by removing doubts and conjectures from the public mind which otherwise must have remained would give general satisfaction it is respectfully submitted to the public by their obedient servant
agreeable to his own appointment on the evening he was committed to prison with permission of the jailor i visited nat on tuesday the st november when without being questioned at all he commenced his narrative in the following words siryou have asked me to give a history of the motives which induced me to undertake the late insurrection as you call it to do so i must go back to the days of my infancy and even before i was born i was thirtyone years of age the d of october last and born the property of benj turner of this country in my childhood a circumstance occurred which made an indelible impression on my mind and laid the groundwork of that enthusiasm which has terminated so fatally to many both white and black and for which i am about to atone at the gallows it is here necessary to relate this circumstancetrifling as it may seem it was the commencement of that belief which has grown with time and even now sir in this dungeon helpless and forsaken as i am i cannot divest myself of being at play with other children when three or four years old i was telling them something which my mother overhearing said it had happened before i was born i stuck to my story however and related some things which went in her opinion to confirm it others being called on were greatly astonished knowing that these things had happened and caused them to say in my hearing i surely would be a prophet as the lord had shown me things that had happened before my birth and my father and mother strength ened me in this my first impression saying in my presence i was intended for some great purpose which they had always thought from certain marks on my head and breasta parcel of excresences which i believe are not at all uncommon particularly among negroes as i have seen several with the same in this case he has either cut them off or they have nearly disappeared my grandmother who was very religious and to whom i was much attached my master who belonged to the church and other religious persons who visited the house and whom i often saw at prayers noticing the singularity of my manners i suppose and my uncommon intelligence for a child remarked i had too much sense to be raised and if i was i would never be of any service to any one as a slave to a mind like mine restless inquisitive and observant of everything that was passing it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which it would be directed and although this subject principally occupied my thoughts there was nothing that i saw or heard of to which my attention was not directed the manner in which i learned to read and write not only had great influence on my own mind as i acquired it with the most perfect ease so much so that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet but to the astonishment of the family one day when a book was shown me to keep me from crying i began spelling the names of the different objects this was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood particularly the blacks and this learning was constantly improved at all opportunities when i got large enough to go to work while employed i was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book when the school children were getting their lessons i would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before all my time not devoted to my masters service was spent either in prayer or in making experiments in casting different things in moulds made of earth in attempting to make paper gunpowder and many other experiments that although i could not perfect yet convinced me of its practicability if i had the means i was not addicted to stealing in my youth nor have ever been yet such was the confidence of the negroes in the neighborhood even at this early period of my life in my superior judgment that they would often carry me with them when they were going on any roguery to plan for them growing up among them with this confidence in my superior judgment and when this in their opinions were perfected by divine inspiration from the circumstances already alluded to in my infancy and which belief was ever afterwards zealously inculcated by the austerity of my life and manners which became the subject of remark by white and black having soon discovered to be great i must appear so and therefore studiously avoided mixing in society and wrapped myself in mystery devoting my time to fasting and prayer by this time having arrived to mans estate and hearing the scriptures commented on at meetings i was struck with that particular passage which says seek ye the kingdom of heaven and all things shall be added unto you i reflected much on this passage and prayed daily for light on this subject as i was praying one day at my plough the spirit spoke to me saying seek ye the kingdom of heaven and all things shall be added unto you questionwhat do you mean by the spirit answerthe spirit that spoke to the prophets in former days and i was greatly astonished and for two years prayed continually whenever my duty would permit and then again i had the same revelation which fully confirmed me in the impression that i was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the almighty several years rolled round in which many events occurred to strengthen me in this my belief at this time i reverted in my mind to the remarks made of me in my childhood and the things that had been shown me and as it had been said of me in my childhood by those by whom i had been taught to pray both white and black and in whom i had the greatest confidence that i had too much sense to be raised and if i was i would never be of any use as a slave now finding i had arrived to mans estate and was a slave and these revelations being made known to me i began to direct my attention to this great object to fulfil the purpose for which by this time i felt assured  was intended knowing the influence i had obtained over the minds of my fellowservants not by the means of conjuring and such like tricks for to them i always spoke of such things with contempt but by the communion of the spirit whose revelations i often communicated to them and they believed and said my wisdom came from god i now began to prepare them for my purpose by telling them something was about to happen that would terminate in fulfilling the great promise that had been made to me about this time i was placed under an overseer from whom i ran away and after remaining in the woods thirty days i returned to the astonishment of the negroes on the plantation who thought i had made my escape to some other part of the country as my father had done before but the reason of my return was that the spirit appeared to me and said i had my wishes directed to the things of this world and not to the kingdom of heaven and that i should return to the service of my earthly masterfor he who knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes and thus have i chastened you and the negroes found fault and murmured against me saying that if they had my sense they would not serve any master in the world and about this time i had a visionand i saw white spirits and black spirits engaged in battle and the sun was darkenedthe thunder rolled in the heavens and blood flowed in streamsand i heard a voice saying such is your luck such you are called to see and let it come rough or smooth you must surely bear it i now withdrew myself as much as my situation would permit from the intercourse of my fellowservants for the avowed purpose of serving the spirit more fully and it appeared to me and reminded me of the things it had already shown me and that it would then reveal to me the knowledge of the elements the revolution of the planets the operation of tides and changes of the seasons after this revelation in the year  and the knowledge of the elements being made known to me i sought more than ever to obtain true holiness before the great day of judgment should appear and then i began to receive the true knowledge of faith and from the first steps of righteousness until the last was i made perfect and the holy ghost was with me and said behold me as i stand in the heavens and i looked and saw the forms of men in different attitudes and there were lights in the sky to which the children of darkness gave other names than what they really were for they were the lights of the saviours hands stretched forth from east to west even as they were extended on the cross on calvary for the redemption of sinners and i wondered greatly at these miracles and prayed to be informed of a certainty of the meaning thereof and shortly afterwards while laboring in the field i discovered drops of blood on the corn as though it were dew from heaven and i communicated it to many both white and black in the neighborhood and i then found on the leaves in the woods hieroglyphic characters and numbers with the forms of men in different attitudes portrayed in blood and representing the figures i had seen before in the heavens and now the holy ghost had revealed itself to me and made plain the miracles it had shown me for as the blood of christ had been shed on this earth and had ascended to heaven for the salvation of sinners and was now returning to earth again in the form of dew and as the leaves on the trees bore the impression of the figures i had seen in the heavens it was plain to me that the saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and the great day of judgment was at hand about this time i told these things to a white man etheldred t brantley on whom it had a wonderful effect and he ceased from his wickedness and was attacked immediately with a cutaneous eruption and blood oozed from the pores of his skin and after praying and fasting nine days he was healed and the spirit appeared to me again and said as the saviour had been baptized so should we be alsoand when the white people would not let us be baptized by the church we went down into the water together in the sight of many who reviled us and were baptized by the spirit after this i rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to god and on the th of may  i heard a loud noise in the heavens and the spirit instantly appeared to me and said the serpent was loosened and christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and that i should take it on and fight against the serpent for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first questiondo you not find yourself mistaken now answerwas not christ crucified and by signs in the heavens that it would make known to me when i should commence the great work and until the first sign appeared i should conceal it from the knowledge of men and on the appearance of the sign the eclipse of the sun last february i should arise and prepare myself and slay my enemies with their own weapons and immediately on the sign appearing in the heavens the seal was removed from my lips and i communicated the great work laid out for me to do to four in whom i had the greatest confidence henry hark nelson and sam it was intended by us to have begun the work of death on the th of july last many were the plans formed and rejected by us and it affected my mind to such a degree that i fell sick and the time passed without our coming to any determination how to commence still forming new schemes and rejecting them when the sign appeared again which determined me not to wait longer since the commencement of  i had been living with mr joseph travis who was to me a kind master and placed the greatest confidence in me in fact i had no cause to complain of his treatment to me on saturday evening the th of august it was agreed between henry hark and myself to prepare a dinner the next day for the men we expected and then to concert a plan as we had not yet determined on any hark on the following morning brought a pig and henry brandy and being joined by sam nelson will and jack they prepared in the woods a dinner where about three oclock i joined them questionwhy were you so backward in joining them answerthe same reason that had caused me not to mix with them for years before i saluted them on coming up and asked will how came he there he answered his life was worth no more than others and his liberty as dear to him i asked him if he thought to obtain it he said he would or lose his life this was enough to put him in full confidence jack i knew was only a tool in the hands of hark it was quickly agreed we should commence at home mr j travis on that night and until we had armed and equipped ourselves and gathered sufficient force neither age nor sex was to be spared which was invariably adhered to we remained at the feast until about two hours in the night when we went to the house and found austin they all went to the cider press and drank except myself on returning to the house hark went to the door with an axe for the purpose of breaking it open as we knew we were strong enough to murder the family if they were awaked by the noise but reflecting that it might create an alarm in the neighborhood we determined to enter the house secretly and murder them whilst sleeping hark got a ladder and set it against the chimney on which i ascended and hoisting a window entered and came down stairs unbarred the door and removed the guns from their places it was then observed that i must spill the first blood on which armed with a hatchet and accompanied by will i entered my masters chamber it being dark i could not give a death blow the hatchet glanced from his head he sprang from the bed and called his wife it was his last word will laid him dead with a blow of his axe and mrs travis shared the same fate as she lay in bed the murder of this family five in number was the work of a moment not one of them awoke there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle that was forgotten until we had left the house and gone some distance when henry and will returned and killed it we got here four guns that would shoot and several old muskets with a pound or two of powder we remained some time at the barn where we paraded i formed them in line as soldiers and after carrying them through all the manoeuvers i was master of marched them off to mr salathul francis about six hundred yards distant sam and will went to the door and knocked mr francis asked who was there sam replied it was him and he had a letter for him on which he got up and came to the door they immediately seized him and dragging him out a little from the door he was dispatched by repeated blows on the head there was no other white person in the family we started from there for mrs reeses maintaining the most perfect silence on our march where finding the door unlocked we entered and murdered mrs reese in her bed while sleeping her son awoke but it was only to sleep the sleep of death he had only time to say who is that and he was no more from mrs reeses we went to mrs turners a mile distant which we reached about sunrise on monday morning henry austin and sam went to the still where finding mr peebles austin shot him and the rest of us went to the house as we approached the family discovered us and shut the door vain hope will with one stroke of his axe opened it and we entered and found mrs turner and mrs newsome in the middle of the room almost frightened to death will immediately killed mrs turner with one blow of his axe i took mrs newsome by the hand and with the sword i had when i was apprehended i struck her several blows over the head but not being able to kill her as the sword was dull will turning around and discovering it dispatched her also a general destruction of property and search for money and ammunition always succeeded the murders by this time my company amounted to fifteen and nine men mounted who started for mrs whiteheads the other six were to go through a byway to mr bryants and rejoin us at mrs whiteheads as we approached the house we discovered mr richard whitehead standing in the cotton patch near the lane fence we called him over into the lane and will the executioner was near at hand with his fatal axe to send him to an untimely grave as we pushed on to the house i discovered some one run around the garden and thinking it was some of the white family i pursued them but finding it was a servant girl belonging to the house i returned to commence the work of death but they whom i left had not been idle all the family were already murdered but mrs whitehead and her daughter margaret as i came round to the door i saw will pulling mrs whitehead out of the house and at the step he nearly severed her head from her body with his broad axe miss margaret when i discovered her had concealed herself in the corner formed by the projection of the cellar cap from the house on my approach she fled but was soon overtaken and after repeated blows with the sword i killed her by a blow on the head with a fence rail by this time the six who had gone by mr bryants rejoined us and informed me they had done the work of death assigned them we again divided part going to mr richard porters and from thence to nathaniel francis the others to mr howell harris and mr t doyles on my reaching mr porters he had escaped with his family i understood there that the alarm had already spread and i immediately returned to bring up those sent to mr doyles and mr howell harristhe party i left going on to mr francis having told them i would join them in that neighborhood i met those sent to mr doyles and mr harris returning having met mr doyle on the road and killed him and learning from some who joined them that mr harris was from home i immediately pursued the course taken by the party gone on before but knowing they would complete the work of death and pillage at mr francis before i could get there i went to mr peter edwards expecting to find them there but they had been here also i then went to mr john t barrows they had been here and murdered him i pursued on their track to capt newit harris where i found the greater part mounted and ready to start the men now amounting to about forty shouted and hurrahed as i rode up some were in the yard loading their guns others drinking they said captain harris and his family had escaped the property in the house they destroyed robbing him of money and other valuables i ordered them to mount and march instantly this was about nine or ten oclock monday morning i proceeded to mr levi wallers two or three miles distant i took my station in the rear and as it was my object to carry terror and devastation wherever we went i placed fifteen or twenty of the best armed and most to be relied on in front who generally approached the houses as fast as their horses could run this was for two purposesto prevent their escape and strike terror to the inhabitants on this account i never got to the houses after leaving mrs whiteheads until the murders were committed except in one case i some times got in sight in time to see the work of death completed viewed the mangled bodies as they lay in silent satisfaction and immediately started in quest of other victims having murdered mrs waller and ten children we started for mr william williams having killed him and two little boys that were there while engaged in this mrs williams fled and got some distance from the house but she was pursued overtaken and compelled to get up behind  one of the company who brought her back and after showing her the mangled body of her lifeless husband she was told to get down and lay by his side where she was shot dead i then started for mr jacob williams where the family were murdered here we found a young man named drury who had come on business with mr williams he was pursued overtaken and shot mrs vaughans was the next place we visited and after murdering the family here i determined on starting for jerusalem our number amounted now to fifty or sixty all mounted and armed with guns axes swords and clubs on reaching mr james w parkers gate immediately on the road leading to jerusalem and about three miles distant it was proposed to me to call there but i objected as i knew he was gone to jerusalem and my object was to reach there as soon as possible but some of the men having relations at mr parkers it was agreed that they might call and get his people i remained at the gate on the road with seven or eight the others going across the field to the house about half a mile off after waiting some time for them i became impatient and started to the house for them and on our return we were met by a party of white men who had pursued our bloodstained track and who had fired on those at the gate and dispersed them which i knew nothing of not having been at that time rejoined by any of them immediately on discovering the whites i ordered my men to halt and form as they appeared to be alarmed the white men eighteen in number approached us in about one hundred yards when one of them fired this was against the positive orders of captain alexander p peete who commanded and who had directed the men to reserve their fire until within thirty paces and i discovered about half of them retreating i then ordered my men to fire and rush on them the few remaining stood their ground until we approached within fifty yards when they fired and retreated we pursued and overtook some of them who we thought we left dead they were not killed after pursuing them about two hundred yards and rising a little hill i discovered they were met by another party and had halted and were reloading their guns this was a small party from jerusalem who knew the negroes were in the field and had just tied their horses to await their return to the road knowing that mr parker and family were in jerusalem but knew nothing of the party that had gone in with captain peete on hearing the firing they immediately rushed to the spot and arrived just in time to arrest the progress of these barbarous villians and save the lives of their friends and fellowcitizens thinking that those who retreated first and the party who fired on us at fifty or sixty yards distant had all only fallen back to meet others with ammunition as i saw them reloading their guns and more coming up than i saw at first and several of my bravest men being wounded the others became panicstruck and squandered over the field the white men pursued and fired on us several times hark had his horse shot under him and i caught another for him as it was running by me five or six of my men were wounded but none left on the field finding myself defeated here i instantly determined to go through a private way and cross the nottoway river at the cypress bridge three miles below jerusalem and attack that place in the rear as i expected they would look for me on the other road and i had a great desire to get there to procure arms and ammunition after going a short distance in this private way accompanied by about twenty men i overtook two or three who told me the others were dispersed in every direction after trying in vain to collect a sufficient force to proceed to jerusalem i determined to return as i was sure they would make back to their old neighborhood where they would rejoin me make new recruits and come down again on my way back i called at mrs thomas mrs spencers and several other places the white families having fled we found no more victims to gratify our thirst for blood we stopped at maj ridleys quarter for the night and being joined by four of his men with the recruits made since my defeat we mustered now about forty strong after placing out sentinels i laid down to sleep but was quickly roused by a great racket starting up i found some mounted and others in great confusion one of the sentinels having given the alarm that we were about to be attacked i ordered some to ride round and reconnoitre and on their return the others being more alarmed not knowing who they were fled in different ways so that i was reduced to about twenty again with this i determined to attempt to recruit and proceed to rally in the neighborhood i had left dr blunts was the nearest house which we reached just before day on riding up the yard hark fired a gun we expected dr blunt and his family were at maj rileys as i know there was a company of men there the gun was fired to ascertain if any of the family were at home we were immediately fired upon and retreated leaving several of my men i do not know what became of them as i never saw them afterwards pursuing our course back and coming in sight of captain harris where we had been the day before we discovered a party of white men at the house on which all deserted me but two jacob and nat we concealed ourselves in the woods until near night when i sent them in search of henry sam nelson and hark and directed them to rally all they could at the place we had had our dinner the sunday before where they would find me and i accordingly returned there as soon as it was dark and remained until wednesday evening when discovering white men riding around the place as though they were looking for some one and none of my men joining me i concluded jacob and nat had been taken and compelled to betray me on this i gave up all hope for the present and on thursday night after having supplied myself with provisions from mr travis i scratched a hole under a pile of fence rails in a field where i concealed myself for six weeks never leaving my hiding place but for a few minutes in the dead of night to get water which was very near thinking by this time i could venture out i began to go about in the night and eavesdrop the houses in the neighborhood pursuing this course for about a fortnight and gathering little or no intelligence afraid of speaking to any human being and returning every morning to my cave before the dawn of day i know not how long i might have led this life if accident had not betrayed me a dog in the neighborhood passing by my hidingplace one night while i was out was attracted by some meat i had in my cave and crawled in and stole it and was coming out just as i returned a few nights after two negroes having started to go hunting with the same dog and passed that way the dog came again to the place and having just gone out to walk about discovered me and barked on which thinking myself discovered i spoke to them to beg concealment on making myself known they fled from me knowing then they would betray me i immediately left my hiding place and was pursued almost incessantly until i was taken a fortnight afterwards by mr benjamin phipps in a little hole i had dug out with my sword for the purpose of concealment under the top of a fallen tree on mr phipps discovering the place of my concealment he cocked his gun and aimed at me i requested him not to shoot and i would give up upon which he demanded my sword i delivered it to him and he brought me to prison during the time i was pursued i had many hairbreadth escapes which your time will not permit me to relate i am here loaded with chains and willing to suffer the fate that awaits me i here proceeded to make some inquiries of him after assuring him of the certain death that awaited him and that concealment would only bring destruction on the innocent as well as the guilty of his own color if he knew of any extensive or concerted plan his answer was i do not when i questioned him as to the insurrection in north carolina happening about the same time he denied any knowledge of it and when i looked him in the face as though i would search his inmost thoughts he replied i see sir you doubt my word but can you not think the same ideas and strange appearances about this time in the heavens might prompt others as well as myself to this undertaking i now had much conversation with and asked him many questions having forborn to do so previously except in the cases noted in parenthesis but during his statement i had unnoticed by him taken notes as to some particular circumstances and having the advantage of his statement before me in writing on the evening of the third day that i had been with him i began a crossexamination and found his statement corroborated by every circumstance coming within my own knowledge or the confessions of others whom had been either killed or executed and whom he had not seen nor had any knowledge since d of august last he expressed himself fully satisfied as to the impracticability of his attempt it has been said he was ignorant and cowardly and that his object was to murder and rob for the purpose of obtaining money to make his escape it is notorious that he was never known to have a dollar in his life to swear an oath or drink a drop of spirits as to his ignorance he certainly never had the advantages of education but he can read and write it was taught him by his parents and for natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension is surpassed by few men i have ever seen as to his being a coward his reason as given for not resisting mr phipps shows the decision of his character when he saw mr phipps present his gun he said he knew it was impossible for him to escape as the woods were full of men he therefore thought it was better to surrender and trust to fortune for his escape he is a complete fanatic or plays his part most admirably on other subjects he possesses an uncommon share of intelligence with a mind capable of attaining anything but warped and perverted by the influence of early impressions he is below the ordinary stature though strong and active having the true negro face every feature of which is strongly marked i shall not attempt to describe the effect of his narrative as told and commented on by himself in the condemned hole of the prison the calm deliberate composure with which he spoke of his late deeds and intentions the expression of his fiendlike face when excited by enthusiasm still bearing the stains of the blood of helpless innocence about him clothed with rags and covered with chains yet daring to raise his manacled hands to heaven with a spirit soaring above the attributes of man i looked on him and my blood curdled in my veins i will not shock the feelings of humanity nor wound afresh the bosoms of the disconsolate sufferers in this unparalleled and inhuman massacre by detailing the deeds of their fiendlike barbarity there were two or three who were in the power of these wretches had they known it and who escaped in the most providential manner there were two whom they thought they left dead on the field at mr parkers but who were only stunned by the blows of their guns as they did not take time to reload when they charged on them the escape of a little girl who went to school at mr wallers and where the children were collecting for that purpose excited general sympathy as their teacher had not arrived they were at play in the yard and seeing the negroes approach she ran up a dirt chimney such as are common to log houses and remained there unnoticed during the massacre of the eleven that were killed at this place she remained in her hiding place till just before the arrival of a party who were in pursuit of the murderers when she came down and fled to a swamp where a mere child as she was with the horrors of the late scene before her she lay concealed until the next day when seeing a party go up to the house she came up and on being asked how she escaped replied with the utmost simplicity the lord helped her she was taken up behind a gentleman of the party and returned to the arms of her weeping mother miss whitehead concealed herself between the bed and the mat that supported it while they murdered her sister in the same room without discovering her she was afterwards carried off and concealed for protection by a slave of the family who gave evidence against several of them on their trial mrs nathaniel francis while concealed in a closet heard their blows and the shrieks of the victims of these ruthless savages they then entered the closet where she was concealed and went out without discovering her while in this hidingplace she heard two of her women in a quarrel about the division of her clothes mr john t baron discovering them approaching his house told his wife to make her escape and scorning to fly fell fighting on his own threshold after firing his rifle he discharged his gun at them and then broke it over the villain who first approached him but he was overpowered and slain his bravery however saved from the hands of these monsters his lovely and amiable wife who will long lament a husband so deserving of her love as directed by him she attempted to escape through the garden when she was caught and held by one of her servant girls but another coming to her rescue she fled to the woods and concealed herself few indeed were those who escaped their work of death but fortunate for society the hand of retributive justice has overtaken them and not one that was known to be concerned has escaped 
leroi jones two short plays the toilet and the slave presented together on an evenings bill might indeed be a little much but not we hasten to add for any of the reasons many of the plays critics have advanced the plays are brief tight intense theatrical units exploding with emotion and therefore calculated to elicit heightened emotional response in the audience furthermore the plays deal with unorthodox matter experimentally and they are plainly designed to shock it is not at all surprising that some spectatorscritics among themelected to leave the close quarters of the st marks theatre in the middle of the first play the toilet but a word about the plays action the toilet which opened the evenings entertainment concerns a group of boys in a metropolitan high school and the ordinary gang politics and powerplays complicated by racial antagonisms most of the boys are negroes and a white boy or two seek identification with the gang well integration if you like one of the white boys had scribbled a note to a husky negro who properly resentful manfully proceeds to rebuff this advance with his fists aided and abetted by his negro cohorts the aggrieved negro youth succeeds in leaving his admirer bloody and belittled on the floor of the boys restroom where all the action takes place however when the bell rings and all the boys have run off to their next classes the manly negro returns and gently holds his vanquished white confrere in his arms the action of the slave takes place in a duplex apartment of a professorial white man and his wife while a revolution is raging in the streets outside the revolution is racial and apparently the blacks are winning into the apartment storms one of the black rebels who it turns out is the exhusband of the professors wife father of the two halfcaste daughters sleeping upstairs and leader of the revolution he is brandishing a revolver and murder is clearly in his heart now much of the criticism of these two plays has been directed at the language used by some of the characters in the toilet for in tance a variety of fourletter words usually withheld from publication are heard in virtually every sentence the language is strongly bravado and overemphasized for effect nevertheless it is easy to see that the squeamish may not wish to be subjected to it the rebel leader in the slave employs abusive language like a weapon it slashes still the mature theatergoer should be willing to suppress the reaction against what might seem to him obscenity long enough to evaluate the plays with some degree of objectivity in doing so it is possible that he will discover two plays of considerable power one quite effective in terms of artistic creation the other all but a failure the toilet manages to be arresting and interesting throughout and its evocation of compassion is not confined to the final scene of reconciliation it is important to remember that in the little world on stage through which the playwright is guiding the psychic vision of the audience all is toughness and vanity love except for self is an alien and unwelcome quantity it is a vile place where these young people find themselves but they are alive in it the slave is neither arresting nor ultimately very interesting despite the raging war without and the cruel violence within there is too much talk and much of it sounds irrelevant after awhile in the end one from the slave is left with the taste of anger ana with no memory of any of the characters humanity the slave also suffered by being the second play on the bill slower in pace deeper in symbol and meaning it might have gained by being considered firstbefore the audiences energies had been milked and it is altogether possible that the slave needs three acts rather than one in which to establish its premises and develop its points for what it would say remains of great importance
in his second novel a drop of patience doubleday  william melvin kelley recreates the night world of cabarets and musicians with economy and skill even though he is restricted to the sensations of the blind musician ludlow washington creator of a new jazz style however it is not ludlows music which is central in the novel but his relationships with women his first and humiliating experience with sex is with malveen a prostitute his marriage with ettasue fails ragan an educated white woman who lives with him is afraid to marry him finally a negro college girl attaches herself to him in all these relation hips there is misunderstanding blindness on their part to his needs and his own blindness in not knowing how much or how little he can expect of them kelley has written an absorbing novel in which he ranges from the eerie atmosphere of the first chapter where ludlow is left in a home for blind children and a boy claims him as his slave to the deadpan humor of a party where ludlow puts a fellow musician onto a white southern woman burdened with guiltdudley randall  the order we impose upon    history  is modified by the entrance of new elements within that order this is a quote from william barretts what is existentialism it has particular pertinence to the subject at hand namely dave dexter jrs the jazz story because dexters book does just thatit modifies in some ways the history of jazz as we have known it the past is never really a fixed or completed thing it is always subject to new discoveries or approaches nowhere is this more evident than in the treatment of the history of jazz for the most part the past of jazz has remained relatively fuzzy and unclear probably due to the reluctance of publishers to print books on the subject until there was enough popular demand to make such books sell in the last few years there have been quite a few attempts at histories of jazz strangely enough some of the better ones have come from for eign authors dexter joins a growing group of writers who feel moved to record the development of this particular american art form because the topic is too broad for one man and one work to encompass it is desirable that more people are turning their efforts to this task for only after we have many many versions and views on the subject will there exist enough background for a realistic consensus and consensus is about all one can expect from the history of jazz dexters particularly strong contributions revolve around his knowledge of the kansas city development for years we have heard of kansas city jazz but dexters is perhaps the most thorough analysis of what actually constituted and produced kansas city jazz as a young writer and jazz fan who lived in kansas city at its most strategic and flourishing time jazzically speaking he is able to relate personal experiences about that hitherto vague mecca of an even more vague jazz style another contribution of the book is the chapter on charlie parker reams have been written on the high priest of bop but most such writing on jazz dieties is usually too emotional and biased in content to have much historical value mr dexter breaks away from this with his frank and candid views based upon personal contact with charlie parker and his close associates but just as his pinnacle of achievement in the book concerns one of the creators of modern jazz so the book also reaches one of its low points in the same area statements mr dexter makes would lead one to suspect that he too has a bias he seems to favor the more traditional kinds of jazz to the contemporary music for this he cannot be criticized for this is a matter of personal taste but what is objectionable is his sometimes questionable statements such as this one on miles davis for all his unquestioned musicianship it is obvious why he has achieved so little in all the years he has worked as a leader and recording artist im not sure what mr dexter uses as a yardstick to measure achievement but judged by all of the traditional criteria his statement must ring a bit thin later on he relates that the modern jazz quartet is    a combo appealing exclusively to the intellectuals the group had no beat   really generally speaking the book moves along pretty well propelled by the momentum of the readers interest and not from any particularly outstanding style in its presentation but it is readable and interesting the book is probably a very useful addition to a jazz collection because it does present us with another competently done work in areas where the author is most at home brooks johnson
perhaps the most controversial of the ideologies of twentieth century africa is that of negritude the concept whose basis is the idea of a particular essence common to black people derived from their common african heritage developed among negro intellectuals under french colonial rule and since its inception has inspired vigorous reaction in african circles but the man who has been the most astonished by the extraordinary career of negritude has been its creator the poet aime cesaire it is not surprising that this should be so for when cesaire first used the term in his celebrated long poem cahier dun re tour au pays natal it had no precise ideological content even today cesaire regards it less as a rational and comprehensive system of thought though he readily accepts some of the objective deductions made from it than as a personal stand in the context of his career as a writer and active politician this adventure started in his native island of martinique where he was born in  he received his secondary education at the local lycee as a scholarship student and was early revolted by the spectacle of his island poor and miserable for the most part but what revolted him most was the mulatto mentality of his compatriots who under the pressure of colonial rule had come to accept the canons of judgment borrowed from their white overlords and had set up a vicious racial discrimination among themselves cesaire later went on to paris to continue his studies at the lycee louis le grand and later at the ecole normale superieure it was at louis le grand that his intimate friendship with leopold senghor who was a fellow student was to open out a new world of feelings and ideas and to plant in the very centre of his experience what has now become its principal aspect namely the sense of racial belonging when i met senghor i knew myself to be african he recalls together they discovered the writings of the new school of anthropology of frobenius and delaforse who began to contest the theory of inherent black inferiority and later the writings of marcel giraule and father tempels who drew attention to the intense spiritual life of african traditional society dissatisfaction with the french policy of assimilation which was based on an official attitude of contempt for the negro though singling out a few individuals for a kind of whitening process soon developed into a reaction among negro intellectuals a racial consciousness born out of indignation against the exactions and ravages of french colonialism on one hand and a new awareness of the human potential of the black race was to lead cesaire and senghor to found a paper with the collaboration of leon damas at the time an already established writer the paper letudiant noir served as an organ for anticolonialism as well as african culture it was in the midst of this intellectual ferment that in  cesaire produced his masterpiece cahier dun re tour au pays natal in which the intense spiritual turmoil of the black intellectual under colonial rule was expressed in the most forceful language for cahier is animated with the bitter wrath of a man who had seen and felt to the remotest nook of being the injustice and indignity of oppression in it cesaire has interiorized the collective drama of his race to such a degree that the poem is no longer the espousal of a cause but rather the assumption of a personal destiny make of me the commissary of its blood make of me the depository of its resentment make of me a man of initiation make of me a man of contemplation but make of me also a man of sowing    the cahier is at the same time a protest poema political document evenas well as a personal testament andre breton who met cesaire during the war in martinique where cesaire had returned to teach literature at the local lycee proclaimed the poem no less than the greatest lyrical monument of our age and his judgment has been confirmed by cesaires subsequent literary career which has made him one of the leading poets in the french language today in  cesaire was elected a deputy to the french national assembly and later became mayor of fort de france capital of martinique he has since led an active political life as the outspoken spokesman for the french caribbean population in this respect his political programme has been autonomy for the french caribbean a formula for giving the antilles a measure of selfdetermination within the framework of frances departmental constitution for cesaire considers the present arrangement by which the west indian territories are directly administered from paris as a concealed form of colonialism cesaires greatest preoccupation has been decolonization in africa and elsewhere as the only condition for the spiritual development of subject peoples he was a prominent figure at the two congresses organized by presence africaine at the second congress in rome he delivered a paper on the role of the writer in the liberation struggle we must hasten the process of decolonization he said that is to say employ all means to hasten the ripening of a popular consciousness in the same spirit he wrote his famous pamphlet discours sur le colonialisme in which he attacked the pretensions of the colonial enterprise from colonization to civilization the distance is infinite and in advocating the recognition of an independent neoafrican culture he wrote it is not a dead society that we want to revive    it is a new society that we need to create a society rich with all the powerful means of modern production and warm with all the ancient fraternitythus cesaires political preoccupation is only a part of a wider problem and his advocacy of the ancient fraternity of african culture is at once affirmation and quest this latter aspect is worked out in the poems where he attempts a revaluation in modern terms through surrealistic imageryof the mystic life of traditional africa as well as an effort at personal identification with its values this is seen in his poem to africa peasant the wind where hulls glide fixes around my face the distant hand of a dream your field in its pillage bursts open with sea monsters that l am helpless to ward off and my gesture is as pure as a forehead of oblivion strike peasant l am your son    yet beyond his immediate concern with the regeneration of africa and her farflung sons his ultimate message is that of the universal brotherhood of manas he says there is room for all at the rendezvous of victory for his poetry as a whole is the expression of a vision of a state when humanity will have achieved the rock without dialect the leaf without keep the fragile water without femur in other words when man will have achieved a concordance with a universe restored to its primal purity
william had told her to go back to his folk in tennessee when he was gone because there wouldnt be any insurance money and she was too old to work sadie had always listened to william and they had lived together  years without getting into trouble but now that summer was coming on and her money running out and william six months in his grave she had got to feeling that she wanted to see something before she passed he had always told her how dangerous it was to see anything beyond the end of your own land or your table and they had lived peaceful this way but she had always known that there was more to  see than met her eyes had known it even as a girl walking along the road that went further to nashville when she saw folks in cars riding by with a kind of look in their eyes which said im going someplace where there is something to see it had come into her head lately especially late at night that none in her line of kin had ever seen anything the old people had come up in slavery and momma after poppa got in trouble and was taken away worked for one family all her years she and william did have plans for charles they meant for him to go to the city and work but he had passed in the war and williams people had always farmed just kept quiet and farmed so none of them had ever seen anything unless maybe charles but she didnt mean the kind of seeing things where you got killed she meant something like just looking where you werent noticed where you could just walk around have nothing special to do and maybe learn something that didnt have colored people written on it so when she had gone to the doctors office for her swoledup leg and saw the pictures in life magazine of all those people milling around the fair she knew thats where she had to go william wouldnt like it a bit it went against everything he believed about peaceful living but he was old fashioned and after charles had passed in france he didnt want to hear anything about going anyplace she never argued with william he had cut out a good life for them but she wondered to herself if maybe that wasnt the trouble all along folks not going anywhere and not seeing anything that way a war comes along and you get killed and you never know why it happened sometimes when william complained about not having more money and then laid it up to god she wanted to say were just ignorant william weve never seen anything and dont know anything but william was too good and he prided himself on knowing enough to get by so she didnt say anything and even from the grave he had a powerful influence over her but she had made up her mind to go to the fair if the time came later in the next world when she would have to explain herself to william she would tell him the truth then there would be plenty of time to straighten things out up there meanwhile she couldnt get all those pictures out of her head all those people and all those lights and what they called exhibits where you could look all day and everyone to busy to watch who else was looking which would give her a chance to have eyes for everything and everyone unless others folks had the same idea and she had the money twohundred and forty dollars and twentyone cents it would be enough to get to new york city and then back to tennessee her leg was hurting her quite a bit though and she was worried about all the walking shed have to do but even so so far as she was concerned she was on her way to the fair and she went to bed feeling that all the world was lit up for her to see it then she got this hot pain running from her leg all through her body and she knew she was going to die she cried some for what she was going to miss for what all her people had ever missed and how could she explain to them all up there why she had waited so long to see something then she got sensible and fixed some words in her mind for william who would wonder what had gotten into her head anyway

shes rocking and shes calling him names and shaking her little butt is she mad or what he say no peace around here at all and he walk off and she laugh now ha ha ha but then i never seen anything like the way after a woman tells a man to get out how she looks when he goes and stand there saying ha ha ha and he dont turn around he walk up the street with his cap just so his hands in his pocket and dont turn around there she is pretending she got her own business too and when he is far from her sight she take off after him walking fast like him and still shaking with it gloria going to find out

wednesday we scrubbed the floor with potash on thursday we run off and did what we did my little brother buddy he threw a turtle in the fire once and it walked clean out of its shell but robert brown never hurt the cats around here and he took care of that dog till it run off he went to school and learned what he had to and he went to the store and sometimes he polished his own shoes and he watched all the fighting around here and never said nothing and he never went up on the roof with the rest of them to do what they do up there and he never stole from nobody but me once he asked me

red top and i share a tworoom apartment out here in nothing weve lived here for two years and will probably stay put until they raise the rent or until a highway comes through or some kind of urban renewal its a nice place if you like old obsolete buildings and substandard living we used to have a cat here about a year ago but the  rats chased him away we used to wash walls and windows and sweep the place once in a while too but it just gets that way again so whats the use i remember how it looked when we moved in and how we put black flag down all around the rooms every night before we went to bed until the people in the other apartments complained that we were disturbing the equal distribution of roaches and threatened to kick us out of here if we didnt accept our share of the bastards and stop trying to be such aristocrats we live in a democracy out here and we didnt want to make enemies of our neighbors so we accepted our quota and learned to live with them we havent learned to eat them yet we eat just about everything else but not these slimy little companions red top is my roommate and quite obviously hes a negro he has a real name but ive forgotten it i guess hes what youd call a handsome man about eight inches over five feet  pounds a head full of nappy red hair gray eyes that slant upward slightly and practically no beard at all he manages to stay in pretty good shape for his age and hes quite popular he never has to buy any he says i should be half so lucky my checks might go a lot farther if i didnt have to pass a little around among the ladies lingerie lounges and at supermarkets for that occasional loaf of bread or bottle of wine from time to time  i get most it backin time ill get it all back from them people like red top and sometimes they come by to visit and bring little things for us red top gets out more than i do sometimes he stays out all day once they locked him up for two weeks as a material witness in a murder trial i thought he was dead it seemed like a logical assumption to me he didnt come home so he must have been dead i was a little disappointed when he finally returned because i had already cashed his check and spent most of it he was disturbed about this he was angry with me hes a pretty vicious guy sometimes i had to get a job to pay him back two weeks he made me work just for money and then he made me pay the rent myself we understand each other though and the arrangement works pretty good most of the time red top is not a native of the city is anybody he was born on a farm the son of a sharecropper who was the son of a sharecropper who was the son of a slavethe son of a white mans slave the son of a son of a bitch he got a chance to break away from home during the big war when he was drafted into the army as a cook and after he had helped free the rest of the world he came back home to become a modernday slave in the great usa he fought the old ways for a while joining every group that promised him equality and freedom but always ended up being investigated by the feds for membership in a subversive organization any damn organization with letters is communist inspired and any movement to correct an existing deformity is communist inspired and any outspoken critic of the good old american way whatever the hell that is is stamped and sealed communistic and red top was one of the hottest communistic noncommunist in the usa they shook him up so he was afraid to sign his name on a pledge card in church he was smart aggressive and on the way up good job and all but he wanted to charge out in front of the ranks carrying the flag of the cause and he did and when he looked around for the rest of the troops they were miles behind him and nobody was near to defend him when they pulled the flag away and cut him up in little pieces and left him for deadand left him dead spiritually without substance without soul dead he drifted around the country for a few years after that sleeping where he could and living from time to time but dying away a little more every day we bumped into each other one day outside the cutrate liquor store we were both standing outside waiting for one of the guys to come out with a bottle of wine and let us have a taste when three little punks appeared with a basket of bottles they had collected throughout the neighborhood and brought to the store to cash in for the grand deposit when the kids came out i took their basket and started to enmass my own personal fortune red top followed me down the alley we struck up a conversation joined forces and spent the afternoon talking about nothing and the effect it has on the rest of the city and searching for bottles the kids had stripped the alleys cleanwe could find only a half dozen bottles scarcely enough for a bottle and a loaf of bread when we got back to the store there was a pop truck parked at the curb the driver and his helper were inside restocking the place when we hit on the idea to take the empties right off the truck you get the bottles and ill watch these cats red top said and i began unloading the truck as id take a case off the truck id hurry around to the side of the building and hide it among the boxes piled there i got twenty cases of empties before red top alerted me after the truck left we carried the cases down the alley and stacked them where theyd be safe for a while and then returned to the store with enough bottles for two pints of wine we turned in a few others at the grocery store and got bologna and bread the idea to buy food was red tops i wanted to drink it all up but hes the kind of guy who has to take care of his stomach since its all fouled up i sort of felt he had the right idea but it was a strange feeling to spend money for food instead of begging for itbuy what you want and beg for what you need thats been our philosophy out here for generations its always worked why should i suddenly have to buy food when its out there if you stand long enough and put it on real strong for some goodnatured chump weve got all kinds of dogooders walking around just praying to find somebody begging for a meal but they always have to give you a lecture the bastards its not enough that you say thank you hell no they want some assurance that youre not going to buy wine they want to ease their conscience because they cant stand the sight of you and though they want to take you to a restaurant and buy a dinner for you its just too much to ask that they should have to socialize with you theyre feeding you and thats enough they keep telling themselves so they say it just before they drop the money in your hand of course they drop it you think they want to touch your hand and it always sounds the same way now youre sure you wont use this to buy yourself a drink or they say now get something to eat and you stand there smiling and lying and agreeing to anything they say so theyll let go of the change and drop it into your crummy  black hand and you can take off and get some bread and cheeze or bologna or a cup of coffee and most of all a pint of something thats really drinkable they dont give you that much though just nickels and dimes just small change to help ease their conscience once in a while theyll try to proposition you too like the cat who asked me to go to bed with his sister so he could watch us she was a nut about negroesshe was a nut about menand he was another kind of nut who was nuts about her being nuts about negroes it takes all kinds    and then there was the old lady about nine hundred years old and the little fairy hes always around hes a safety valve for some of us and all kinds of weird people so red top and i got along pretty good we got on relief about the same time and moved into this crummy place and have been here ever since at first i used to go out and find odd jobs but that got to be too laborious and i decided to just stay home sometimes i write sometimes i read most of the time i get drunkthats making sense out of life red top worked for a while but the welfare officer caught up with him and was taking fifty percent of his pay as a kickback and red top said to hell with him why should the white man get rich off him he quit the job and now just takes it easy like me and has a little hustle going at night down the street in one of the houses he sort of sees to it that the girls are properly protected before during and after i think thats why he never has to buy it he says its not true but i know it ishes not that good nobody is everybody has to pay sooner or later everybody has to pay its sort of a quiet life we lead here no television or radio to distract us from our thoughts and dreams and drinks for a long time we had a rather interesting schedule for the first week of the money  what with money being plentiful and dwindling away to absolutely nothing by the middle of the monthbeginning with monday as the first day to find out what had taken place over the weekend wed start out at marovitz grocery store standing in front of the meat counter listening to the women relate their long narratives about susans kitchenette whippin this applies strictly to adults fighting not children to sams encounter with the book who never pays on time all the way to big p bailing a couple of his girls out of jail and mr marovitz you should have seed her when she came runnin out of her room why    she had blood all over her and not a stitch of clothes onnot even well just not a stitch mr marovitz eyes would light up and he would be lost to the story and not see the children stealing sweets for that matter he wouldnt even see me and red top stealing well i sure saw that woman a lady interrupted she bust right into my place and begged me to help her and all the time my husband the damn fool he just standing there smilin like some stupid asshe just smilin and lookin i gave her my housecoat and told her i didnt want no blood on it and i wanted it back wed hang around there until we found where they were holding the inquest thats right the inquest monday without an inquest would have been like monday without daylight it would have been like monday without breathing we had to have an inquest because somebody always got killed over the weekend either by car or knife or gun or heroin or a policeman or falling from a window    anything but suicide we dont do that we leave suicide for white people because theyre fragile and cant take it suicide is for the whites because theyve got everything suicide is for the whites because they dont have anything so by monday morning the weekend of drinking had caught up with us and it was a pleasure to sit in a quiet funeral parlor and smell the flowers and listen to the witnesses lie everybody blaming the dead man or woman the flowers were always pretty we got to love this time of the week the clean floors the high ceilings the beautiful flower arrangements the various scents filling the room we got so we enjoyed the damn places so much we started stopping by in the evenings during the middle of the week to see if there was a wake going onthe black pat and mike paying our respects to the bereaved family if we were lucky and didnt look too bad they might invite us by for a drink afterwards we had some swinging wakes sometimes red top would make out with the cats wife or aunt or cousin or maybe even his brother i never made out with anyone but then i never do so thats not too important after leaving the inquest on this first day of the first week of the month our checks in our pockets wed go back to mr marovitz store cash our checks bring the food accounts up to date and head for the hottest spot on the street herbs barber shop everybody was there they loved the place the guys in show business staying at the hotel used the shop as their conversation corner during the day a few of the policy runners with their little books would stop in between deliveries on their runs and joke with the rest of the sitters sitting around living and reliving the weekend before they cut out to start back to the hustle herb was about hes always  been about  except hes losing his hair now and can no longer stand in front of the mirror combing and pushing his pompand used to be a little on the heavy side before he started playing golf like everybody started playing golf at about the same time because the money got big for all of them at  about the same time and the courses began to open up a couple of them anyway and take negroes in on a large scale herb was happy smooth dapper and everyone loved him he had a memory like an elephant and could recall vividly incidents that happened when he first came to the city at the age of nine he knew everybody and didnt seem to be impressed with status one way or the other oh he respected authority and was pleased when someone who grew up with him made the big time but it didnt really move him he just liked people and didnt give a damn where they come from or what line they were in so long as they conducted themselves like gentlemen when they were in his establishment herb had a barber working with him back a few years agowell before that he had three barbers working there but that was during the war when things were really goodand the cat couldnt leave the bottle alone herb wouldnt let his barber drink in the shop so youd see the cat cut a while talk a while cut a while and then step outside and around the corner to a place where he stashed his pint and then come tipping sheepishly back to his customer making some excuse about not being able to get his throat cleared herb would cut his eyes at him and the message would be delivered without words herb would never have said anything in front of the customers the cat used to get so stoned that by  oclock he couldnt cut another head and herb would tell him to go home hed come back the next morning apologizing and promising never to do it again and always herb would forgive him things went on like that for a year until herb finally had to let him go and the cat went up and down the street telling everybody what a rotten bastard herb was for kicking him out after the way he had run the shop so efficiently for him and all and the way he used to stay late and see to it that herb would get away for business and how tight herb was for not giving him what he was really worth but instead all he gave him was a kick in the ass you know people believed this guysome of them actually believed him its convenient to believe only what you want to believe sometimes a singer who had made it up the ladder to one of the big clubs downtown would come in and tell stories of things that had happened to him in detroit and new york and philadelphia and san francisco and everyone would sit quietly through each tale and then prime him for another black jack kept us posted on who had hit the numbers and for how much and slick and mr p would argue about who had the best girls cats would come in selling hot shoes and shirts and socks and jackets and coats and furs and cufflinks and all kinds of good buys sometimes red top and i would buy but mostly wed just look the crap over and pass it on to the next cat who would look it over and pass it on to the next who would look it over and somebody was always stopping in to put the quiet touch on herb theyd come in and whisper something in his ear hed nod and run his hand in his pocket and bring out the right amount he had a knack for bringing out just what the guy had asked for and no more and he would nonchalantly slide it into the cats hand with his left hand while his right hand kept cutting and cutting and cutting and the slickemback boys would sit under the dryers with their scalps tingling and their inner souls bursting with anticipation the longing for the waves to be meticulously set by the barber who has grown to be barberbeautician with the advent of the new hair straightening operation called the process now the whole world can have straight hair wed get our monthly haircut and sit around for another hour or two soaking up the stories and then wed cut out for jakes lounge and sit for a while drinking whisky and beer and then drop by the cutrate liquor store for the stockpile of wine take the blood home and hide it from ourselves and then take off for the street with a pint in the back pocket off for the big street stopping in alleys from time to time to taste    up and down the street one side and the other pinching butts joking making out trying to make out but youve always got to pay the best we knew how and sharing a wine with the cats who didnt have any because theyd have some sooner or later and we damn sure wanted to be on the list when they started paying back and as always wed get damn good and drunk and end up with some of the reserve supply gone and a babe in the bed whos still drunk she had to be drunk when you woke up or it didnt seem real if you got one who was as sober as you the next morning you didnt trust her you just knew she had taken all of the blood and hid it some place while you were stoned youd wake her up and kick her out of your bed and start tuesday off with a tall glass of ice cold water trying to activate the high and get it going again without drinking any of your blood it never worked though so youd have to start in again in order to remain stable and steady
in his new book who speaks for the negro poetnovelist robert penn warren states the following the italics are added it is selfinterest to want to live in a society operating by the love of justice and the concept of law we have not been living in such a society it is selfinterest to want all members of society to contribute as fully as possible to the enrichment of that society the structure of our society has prevented that it is selfinterest to want to escape from the pressure to conform to values which we feel immoral or antiquated our society has maintained such pressures it is selfinterest to want to escape from the burden of vanity into the hard and happy realization that in the diminishment of others there is a deep diminishment of the self our society has been organized for the diminishment of others more than a half century ago in the souls of black folk w e b dubois called us this happygolucky nation which goes blundering along with its reconstruction tragedies its spanish war interludes and philippine matinees just as though god were really dead a lot has happened since he said that but perhaps god is not dead yet it would be sentimentality to think that our society can be changed easily and without pain it would be worse sentimentality to think that it can be changed without some pain to our particular selvesblack and white it would be realism to think that that pain would be a reasonable price to pay for what we all selfishly might get out of it our own freedom this passage and others like it from mr warrens book is being praised for its wisdom and insight but as mr warren inferred dubois was saying it all a half century ago and james baldwin has been saying it lately how odd that the words take on so much more significance when the hand that holds the pen is white
not so very long ago the earth numbered two thousand mil lion inhabitants five hundred million men and one thousand      five hundred million natives the former had the word the i others had the use of it between the two there were hired kinglets overlords and a bourgeoisie sham from beginning to end which served as gobetweens in the colonies the truth stood naked but the citizens of the mothercountry preferred it with clothes on the native had to love them something in the way mothers are loved the european elite undertook to manufacture a native elite they picked out promising adolescents they branded them as with a redhot iron with the principles of western culture they stuffed their mouths full with highsounding phrases grand glutinous words that stuck to the teeth after a short stay in the mother country they were sent home whitewashed these walking lies had nothing left to say to their brothers they only echoed from paris from london from amsterdam we would utter the words parthenon brotherhood and somewhere in africa or asia lips would open    thenon    therhood it was the golden age it came to an end the mouths opened by themselves the yellow and black voices still spoke of our humanism but only to reproach us with our inhumanity we listened without displeasure to these polite statements of resentment at first with proud amazement what they are able to talk by themselves just look at what we have made of them we did not doubt but that they would accept our ideals since they accused us of not being faithful to them then indeed europe could believe in her mission she had hellenized the asians she had created a new breed the grecolatin negroes we might add quite between ourselves as men of the world after all let them bawl their heads off it relieves their feelings dogs that bark dont bite a new generation came on the scene which changed the issue with unbelievable patience its writers and poets tried to explain to us that our values and the true facts of their lives did not hang together and that they could neither reject them completely nor yet assimilate them by and large what they were saying was this you are making us into monstrosities your humanism claims we are at one with the rest of humanity but your racist methods set us apart very much at our ease we listened to them all colonial administrators are not paid to read hegel and for that matter they do not read much of him but they do not need a philosopher to tell them that uneasy consciences are caught up in their own contradictions they will not get anywhere so let us perpetuate their discomfort nothing will come of it but talk if they were the experts told us asking for anything at all precise in their wailing it would be integration of course there is no question of granting that the system which depends on overexploitation as you know would be ruined but its enough to hold the carrot in front of their noses theyll gallop all right as to a revolt we need not worry at all what native in his senses would go off to massacre the fair sons of europe simply to become european as they are in short we encouraged these disconsolate spirits and thought it not a bad idea for once to award the prix goncourt to a negro that was before   listen let us waste no time in sterile litanies and nauseating mimicry leave this europe where they are never done talking of man yet murder men everywhere they find them at the corner of every one of their own streets in all the corners of the globe for centuries they have stifled almost the whole of humanity in the name of a socalled spiritual experience the tone is new who dares to speak thus it is an african a man from the third world an exnative he adds europe now lives at such a mad reckless pace that she is running headlong into the abyss we would do well to keep away from it in other words shes done for a truth which is not pleasant to state but of which we are all convinced are we not felloweuropeans in the marrow of our bones we must however make one reservation when a frenchman for example says to other frenchmen the country is done forwhich has happened i should think almost every day since it is emotional talk burning with love and fury the speaker includes himself with his fellowcountrymen and then usually he adds unless    his meaning is clear no more mistakes must be made if his instructions are not carried out to the letter then and only then will the country go to pieces in short it is a threat followed by a piece of advice and these remarks are so much the less shocking in that they spring from a national intersubjectivity but on the contrary when fanon says of europe that she is rushing to her doom far from sounding the alarm he is merely setting out a diagnosis this doctor neither claims that she is a hopeless case miracles have been known to existnor does he give her the means to cure herself he certifies that she is dying on external evidence founded on symptoms that he can observe as to curing her no he has other things to think about he does not give a damn whether she lives or dies because of this his book is scandalous and if you murmur jokingly embarrassed he has it in for us the true nature of the scandal escapes you for fanon has nothing in it for you at all his workredhot for some in what concerns you is as cold as ice he speaks of you often never to you the black goncourts and the yellow nobels are finished the days of colonized laureats are over an exnative frenchspeaking bends that language to new requirements makes use of it and speaks to the colonized only natives of all underdeveloped countries unite what a downfall for the fathers we alone were the speakers the sons no longer even consider us as valid intermediaries we are the objects of their speeches of course fanon mentions in passing our wellknown crimes setif hanoi madagascar but he does not waste his time in condemning them he uses them if he demonstrates the tactics of colonialism the complex play of relations which unite and oppose the colonists to the people of the mother country it is for his brothers his aim is to teach them to beat us at our own game in short the third world finds itself and speaks to itself through his voice we know that it is not a homogeneous world we know too that enslaved peoples are still to be found there together with some who have achieved a simulacrum of phoney independence others who are still fighting to attain sovereignty and others again who have obtained complete freedom but who live under the constant menace of imperialist aggression these differences are bom of colonial history in other words of oppression here the mother country is satisfied to keep some feudal rulers in her pay there dividing and ruling she has created a native bourgeosie sham from beginning to end elsewhere she has played a double game the colony is planted with settlers and exploited at the same time thus europe has multiplied divisions and opposing groups has fashioned classes and sometimes even racial prejudices and has endeavoured by every means to bring about and intensify the stratification of colonised societies fanon hides nothing in order to fight against us the former colony must fight against itself or rather the two struggles form part of a whole in the heat of battle all internal barriers break down the puppet bourgeoisie of businessmen and shopkeepers the urban proletariat which is always in a privileged position the lumpenproletariat of the shanty townsall fall into line with the stand made by the rural masses that veritable reservoir of a national revolutionary army for in those countries where colonialism has deliberately held up development the peasantry when it rises quickly stands out as the revolutionary class for it knows naked oppression and suffers far more from it than the workers in the towns and in order not to die of hunger it demands no less than a complete demolishing of all existing structures in order to triumph the national revolution must be socialist if its career is cut short if the native bourgeoisie takes over power the new state in spite of its formal sovereignty remains in the hands of the imperialists the example of katanga illustrates this quite well thus the unity of the third world is not yet achieved it is a work in progress which begins by the union in each country after independence as before of the whole of the colonised people under the command of the peasant class this is what fanon explains to his brothers in africa asia and latin america we must achieve revolutionary socialism all together everywhere or else one by one we will be defeated by our former masters he hides nothing neither weaknesses nor discords nor mystification here the movement gets off to a bad start there after a striking initial success it loses momentum elsewhere it has come to a standstill and if it is to start again the peasants must throw their bourgeoisie overboard the reader is sternly put on his guard against the most dangerous will o the wisps the cult of the leader and of personalities western culture and what is equally to be feared the withdrawal into the twilight of past african culture for the only true culture is that of the revolution that is to say it is constantly in the making fanon speaks out loud we europeans can hear him as the fact that you hold this book in your hand proves is he not then afraid that the colonial powers may take advantage of his sincerity no he fears nothing our methods are outofdate they can sometimes delay emancipation but not stop it and do not think that we can change our ways neocolonialism that idle dream of mothercountries is a lot of hot air the third forces dont exist or if they do they are only the tinpot bourgeoisies that colonialism has already placed in the saddle our machiavellianism has little purchase on this wideawake world that has run our falsehoods to earth one after the other the settler has only recourse to one thing brute force when he can command it the native has only one choice between servitude or supremacy what does fanon care whether you read his work or not it is to his brothers that he denounces our old tricks and he is sure we have no more up our sleeves it is to them he says europe has laid her hands on our continents and we must slash at her fingers till she lets go its a good moment nothing can happen at bizerta at elizabethville or in the algerian bled  that the whole world does not hear about the rival blocks take opposite sides and hold each other in check let us take advantage of this paralysis let us burst into history forcing it by our invasion into universality for the first time let us start fighting and if weve no other arms the waiting knifes enough europeans you must open this book and enter into it after a few steps in the darkness you will see strangers gathered around a fire come close and listen for they are talking of the destiny they will mete out to your tradingcentres and to the hired soldiers who defend them they will see you perhaps but they will go on talking among themselves without even lowering their voices this indifference strikes home their fathers shadowy creatures your creatures were but dead souls you it was who allowed them glimpses of light to you only did they dare speak and you did not bother to reply to such zombies their sons ignore you a fire warms them and sheds light around them and you have not lit it now  upcountry in north africa transl at a respectful distance it is you who will feel furtive nightbound and perished with cold turn and turn about in these shadows from whence a new dawn will break it is you who are the zombies in this case you will say lets throw away this book why read it if it is not written for us for two reasons the first is that fanon explains you to his brothers and shows them the mechanism by which we are estranged from ourselves take advantage of this and get to know yourselves seen in the light of truth objectively our victims know us by their scars and by their chains and it is this that makes their evidence irrefutable it is enough that they show us what we have made of them for us to realise what we have made of ourselves but is it any use yet for europe is at deaths door but you will say we live in the mother country and we disapprove of her excesses it is true you are not settlers but you are no better for the pioneers belonged to you you sent them overseas and it was you they enriched you warned them that if they shed too much blood you would disown them or say you did in something of the same way as any state maintains abroad a mob of agitators agents provocateurs and spies whom it disowns when they are caught you who are so liberal and so humane who have such an exaggerated adoration of culture that it verges on affectation you pretend to forget that you own colonies and that in them men are massacred in your name fanon reveals to his comradesabove all to some of them who are rather too westernisedthe solidarity of the people of the mothercountry and of their representatives in the colonies have the courage to read this book for in the first place it will make you ashamed and shame as marx said is a revolutionary sentiment you see i too am incapable of ridding myself of subjective illusions i too say to you all is lost unless    as a european i steal the enemys book and out of it i fashion a remedy for europe make the most of it and here is the second reason if you set aside sorels fascist utterances you will find that fanon is the first since engels to bring the processes of history into the clear light of day moreover you need not think that hotheadedness or an unhappy childhood have given him some uncommon taste for violence he acts as the interpreter of the situation thats all but this is enough to enable him to constitute step by step the dialectic which liberal hypocrisy hides from you and which is as much responsible for our existence as for his during the last century the middle classes looked on the workers as covetous creatures made lawless by their greedy desires but they took care to include these great brutes in our own species or at least they considered that they were free menthat is to say free to sell their labour in france as in england humanism claimed to be universal in the case of forced labour it is quite the contrary there is no contract moreover there must be intimidation and thus oppression grows our soldiers overseas rejecting the universalism of the mother country apply the numerous clausus to the human race since none may enslave rob or kill his fellowman without committing a crime they lay down the principle that the native is not one of our fellowmen our strikingpower has been given the mission of changing this abstract certainty into reality the order is given to reduce the inhabitants of the annexed country to the level of superior monkeys in order to justify the settlers treatment of them as beasts of burden violence in the colonies does not only have for its aim the keeping of these enslaved men at arms length it seeks to dehumanise them everything will be done to wipe out their traditions to substitute our language for theirs and to destroy their culture without giving them ours sheer physical fatigue will stupefy them starved and ill if they have any spirit left fear will finish the job guns are levelled at the peasant civilians come to take over his land and force him by dint of flogging to till the land for them if he shows fight the soldiers fire and hes a dead man if he gives in he degrades himself and he is no longer a man at all shame and fear will split up his character and make his inmost self fall to pieces the business is conducted with flying colours and by experts the psychological services werent established yesterday nor was brainwashing and yet in spite of all these efforts their ends are nowhere achieved neither in the congo where negroes hands were cut off nor in angola where until very recently malcontents lips were pierced in order to shut them with padlocks i do not say that it is impossible to change a man into an animal i simply say that you wont get there without weakening him considerably blows will never suffice you have to push the starvation further and thats the trouble with slavery
for when you domesticate a member of our own species you reduce his output and however little you may give him a farmyard man finishes by costing more than he brings in for this reason the settlers are obliged to stop the breakinginhalfway the result neither man nor animal is the native beaten undernourished ill terrifiedbut only up to a certain pointhe has whether hes black yellow or white always the same traits of character hes a slyboots a lazybones and a thief who lives on nothing and who understands only violence poor settler here is his contradiction naked shorn of its trappings he ought to kill those he plunders as they say djinns do now this is not  possible because he must exploit them as well because he cant carry massacre on to genocide and slavery to animallike degradation he loses control the machine goes into reverse and a relentless logic leads him on to decolonisation but it does not happen immediately at first the europeans reign continues he has already lost the battle but this is not obvious he does not yet know that the natives are only halfnative to hear him talk it would seem that he illtreats them in order to destroy or to repress the evil that they have rooted in them and after three generations their pernicious instincts will reappear no more what instincts does he mean the instincts that urge slaves on to massacre their master can he not here recognise his own cruelty turned against himself in the savagery of these oppressed peasants does he not find his own settlers savagery which they have absorbed through every pore and for which there is no cure the reason is simple this imperious being crazed by his absolute power and by the fear of losing it no longer remembers clearly that he was once a man he takes himself for a horsewhip or a gun he has come to believe that the domestication of the inferior races will come about by the conditioning of their reflexes but in this he leaves out of account the human memory and the ineffaceable marks left upon it and then above all there is something which perhaps he has never known we only become what we are by the radical and deepseated refusal of that which others have made of us three generations did we say hardly has the second generation opened their eyes than from then on theyve seen their fathers being flogged in psychiatric terms they are traumatised for life but these constantly renewed aggressions far from bringing them to submission thrust them into an unbearable contradiction which the european will pay for sooner or later after that when it is their turn to be broken in when they are taught what shame and hunger and pain are all that is stirred up in them is a volcanic fury whose force is equal to that of the pressure put upon them you said they understand nothing but violence of course first the only violence is the settlers but soon they will make it their own that is to say the same violence is thrown back upon us as when our reflection comes forward to meet us when we go towards a mirror make no mistake about it by this mad fury by this bitterness and spleen by their everpresent desire to kill us by the permanent tensing of powerful muscles which are afraid to relax they have become men men because of the settler who wants to make beasts of burden of them because of him and against him hatred blind hatred which is as yet an abstraction is their only wealth the master calls it forth because he seeks to reduce them to animals but he fails to break it down because his interests stop him halfway thus the half natives are still humans through the power and the weakness of the oppressor which is transformed within them into a stubborn refusal of the animal condition we realise what follows theyre lazy of courseits a form of sabotage theyre sly and thieving just imagine but their petty thefts mark the beginning of a resistance which is still unorganised that is not enough there are those among them who assert themselves by throwing themselves barehanded against the guns these are their heros others make men of themselves by murdering europeans and these are shot down brigands or martyrs their agony exalts the terrified masses yes terrified at this fresh stage colonial aggression turns inward in a current of terror among the natives by this i do not only mean the fear that they experience when faced with our inexhaustible means of repression but also that which their own fury produces in them they are cornered between our guns pointed at them and those terrifying compulsions those desires for murder which spring from the depth of their spirits and which they do not always recognise for at first it is not their violence it is ours which turns back on itself and rends them and the first action of these oppressed creatures is to bury deep down that hidden anger which their and our moralities condemn and which is however only the last refuge of their humanity read fanon you will learn how in the period of their helplessness their mad impulse to murder is the expression of the natives collective unconscious if this suppressed fury fails to find an outlet it turns in a vacuum and devastates the oppressed creatures themselves in order to free themselves they even massacre each other the different tribes fight between themselves since they cannot face the real enemyand you can count on colonial policy to keep up their rivalries the man who raises his knife against his brother thinks that he has destroyed once and for all the detested image of their common degradation even though these expiatory victims dont quench their thirst for blood they can only stop themselves from marching against the machineguns by doing our work for us of their own accord they will speed up the dehumanisation that they reject under the amused eye of the settler they will take the greatest precautions against their own kind by setting up supernatural barriers at times reviving old and terrible myths at others binding themselves by scrupulous rites it is in this way that an obsessed person flees from his deepest needsby binding himself to certain observances which require his attention at every turn they dance that keeps them busy it relaxes their painfully contracted muscles and then the dance mimes secretly often without their knowing the refusal they cannot utter and the murders they dare not commit in certain districts they make use of that last resortpossession by spirits formerly this was a religious experience in all its simplicity a certain communion of the faithful with sacred things now they make of it a weapon against humiliation and despair mumbojumbo and all the idols of the tribe come down among them rule over their violence and waste it in trances until it is exhausted at the same time these highplaced personages protect them in other words the colonised people protect themselves against colonial estrangement by going one better in religious estrangement with the unique result that finally they add the two estrangements together and each reinforces the other thus in certain psychoses the hallucinated person tired of always being insulted by his demon one fine day starts hearing the voice of an angel who pays him compliments but the jeers dont stop for all that only from then on they alternate with congratulations this is a defence but it is also the end of the story the self is disassociated and the patient heads for madness let us add for certain other carefully selected unfortunates that other witchery of which i have already spoken western culture if i were them you may say id prefer my mumbojumbo to their acropolis very good youve grasped the situation but not altogether because you arent themor not yet otherwise you would know that they cant choose they must have both two worlds that makes two bewitchings they dance all night and at dawn they crowd into the churches to hear mass each day the split widens our enemy betrays his brothers and becomes our accomplice his brothers do the same thing the status of native is a nervous condition introduced and maintained by the settler among colonised people with their consent laying claim to and denying the human condition at the same time the contradiction is explosive for that matter it does explode you know as well as i do and we are living at the moment when the match is put to the fuse when the rising birthrate brings wider famine in its wake when these newcomers have life to fear rather more than death the torrent of violence sweeps away all barriers in algeria and angola europeans are massacred at sight it is the moment of the boomerang it is the third phase of violence it comes back on us it strikes us and we do not realise any more than we did the other times that its we that have launched it the liberals are stupefied they admit that we were not polite enough to the natives that it would have been wiser and fairer to allow them certain rights in so far as this was possible they ask nothing better than to admit them in batches and without sponsors to that very exclusive club our species and now this barbarous mad outburst doesnt spare them any more than the bad settlers the left at home is embarrassed they know the true situation of the natives the merciless oppression they are submitted to they do not condemn their revolt knowing full well that we have done everything to provoke it but all the same they think to themselves there are limits these guerillas should be bent on showing that they are chivalrous that would be the best way of showing they are men sometimes the left scolds them   youre going too far we wont support you any more the natives dont give a damn about their support for all the good it does them they might as well stuff it up their backsides once their war began they saw this hard truth that every single one of us has made his bit has got something out of them they dont need to call anyone to witness theyll grant favoured treatment to no one there is one duty to be done one end to achieve to thrust out colonialism by every means in their power the more farseeing among us will be in the last resort ready to admit this duty and this end but we cannot help seeing in this ordeal by force the altogether inhuman means that these lessthanmen make use of to win the concession of a charter of humanity accord it to them at once then and let them endeavour by peaceful undertakings to deserve it our worthiest souls contain racial prejudice they would do well to read fanon for he shows clearly that this irrepressible violence is neither sound and fury nor the resurrection of savage instincts nor even the effect of resentment it is man recreating himself i think we understood this truth at one time but we have forgotten itthat no gentleness can efface the marks of violence only violence itself can destroy them the native cures himself of colonial neurosis by thrusting out the settler through force of arms when his rage boils over he rediscovers his lost innocence and he comes to know himself in that he himself creates his self far removed from his war we consider it as a triumph of barbarism but of its own volition it achieves slowly but surely the emancipation of the rebel for bit by bit it destroys in him and around him the colonial gloom once begun it is a war that gives no quarter you may fear or be feared that is to say abandon yourself to the disassociations of a sham existence or conquer your birthright of unity when the peasant takes a gun in his hands the old myths grow dim and the prohibitions are one by one forgotten the rebels weapon is the proof of his humanity for in the first days of the revolt you must kill to shoot down a european is to kill two birds with one stone to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time there remain a dead man and a free man the survivor for the first time feels a national soil under his foot at this moment the nation does not shrink from him wherever he goes wherever he may be she is she follows and is never lost to view for she is one with his liberty but after the first surprise the colonial army strikes and then all must unite or be slaughtered tribal dissensions weaken and tend to disappear in the first place because they endanger the revolution but for the more profound reason that they served no other purpose before than to divert violence against false foes when they remainas in the congoits because they are kept up by the agents of colonialism the nation marches forward for each of her children she is to be found wherever his brothers are fighting their feeling for each other is the reverse of the hatred they feel for you they are bothers inasmuch as each of them has killed and may at any moment have to kill again fanon shows his readers the limits of spontaneity and the need for and dangers of organisation but however great may be the task at each turning of the way the revolutionary consciousness deepens the last complexes flee away no one need come to us talking of the dependency complex of an aln soldier c  with his blinkers off the peasant takes account of his real needs before they were enough to kill him but he tried to ignore them now he sees them as infinitely great requirements in this violence which springs from the people which enables them to hold out for five yearsfor eight years as the algerians have donethe military political and social necessities cannot be separated the war by merely setting the question of command and responsibility institutes new structures which will become the first institutions of peace here then is man even now established in new traditions the future children of a horrible present here then we see him legitimised by a law which will be bom or is born each day under fire once the last settler is killed shipped home or assimilated the minority breed disappears to be replaced by socialism and thats not enough the rebel does not stop there for you can be quite sure that he is not risking his skin to find himself at the level of a former inhabitant of the old mother country look how patient he is perhaps he dreams of another dien bien phu  but dont think hes really counting on it hes a beggar fighting in his poverty against rich men powerfully armed while he is waiting for decisive victories or even without expecting them at all he tires out his adversaries until they are sick of him it will not be without fearful losses the colonial army becomes ferocious the country is marked out there are moppingup operations transfers of population reprisal expeditions and they massacre women and children he knows this this new man begins his life as a man at the end of it he considers himself as a potential corpse he will be killed not only does he accept this risk hes sure of it this potential dead man has lost his wife and his children he has seen so many dying men that he prefers victory to survival others not he will have the fruits of victory he is too weary of it all but this weariness of the heart is the root of an unbelievable courage we find our humanity on this side of death and despair he finds it beyond torture and death we have sown the wind he is the whirlwind the child of violence at every moment he draws from it his humanity we were men at his expense he makes himself man at ours a different man of higher quality here fanon stops he has shown the way forward he is the spokesman of those who are fighting and he has called for union that is to say the unity of the african continent against all dissensions and all particularisms he has gained his end if he had wished to describe in all its details the historical phenomenon of decolonisation he would have to have spoken of us this is not at all his intention but when we have closed the book the argument continues within us in spite of its author for we feel the strength of the peoples in revolt and we answer by force thus there is a fresh moment of violence and this time we ourselves are involved for by its nature this violence is changing us accordingly as the halfnative is changed everyone of us must think for himselfalways provided that he thinks at all for in europe today stunned as she is by the blows received by france belgium or england even to allow your mind to be diverted however slightly is as good as being the accomplice in crime of colonialism this book had not the slightest need of a preface all the less because it is not addressed to us yet i have written one in order to bring the argument to its conclusion for we in europe too are being decolonised that is to say that the settler which is in every one of us is being savagely rooted out let us look at ourselves if we can bear to and see what is becoming of us first we must face that unexpected revelation the striptease of our humanism there you can see it quite naked and its not a pretty sight it was nothing but an ideology of lies a perfect justification for pillage its honeyed words its affectation of sensibility were only alibis for our aggressions a fine sight they are too the believers in nonviolence saying that they are neither executioners nor victims very well then if youre not victims when the government which youve voted for when the army in which your younger brothers are serving without hesitation or remorse have undertaken race murder you are without a shadow of doubt executioners and if you choose to be victims and to risk being put in prison for a day or two you are simply choosing to pull your irons out of the fire but you will not be able to pull them out theyll have to stay there till the end try to understand this at any rate if violence began this very evening and if exploitation and oppression had never existed on the earth perhaps the slogans of nonviolence might end the quarrel but if the whole regime even your nonviolent ideas are conditioned by a thousand yearold oppression your passivity serves only to place you in the ranks of the oppressors you know well enough that we are exploiters you know too that we have laid hands on first the gold and metals then the petroleum of the new continents and that we have brought them back to the old countries this was not without excellent results as witness our palaces our cathedrals and our great industrial cities and then when there was the threat of a slump the colonial markets were there to soften the blow or to divert it crammed with riches europe accorded the human status de jure to its inhabitants with us to be a man is to be an accomplice of colonialism since all of us without exception have profited by colonial exploitation this fat pale continent ends by falling into what fanon rightly calls narcissism cocteau became irritated with paris that city which talks about itself the whole time is europe any different and that supereuropean monstrosity north america chatter chatter liberty equality fraternity love honour patriotism and what have you all this did not prevent us from making antiracial speeches about dirty niggers dirty jews and dirty arabs highminded people liberal or just softhearted protest that they were shocked by such inconsistency but they were either mistaken or dishonest for with us there is nothing more consistent than a racist humanism since the european has only been able to become a man through creating slaves and monsters while there was a native population somewhere this imposture was not shown up in the notion of the human race we found an abstract assumption of universality which served as cover for the most realistic practices on the other side of the ocean there was a race of lessthanhumans who thanks to us might reach our status a thousand years hence perhaps in short we mistook the elite for the genus today the native populations reveal their true nature and at the same time our exclusive club reveals its weaknessthat its neither more nor less than a minority worse than that since the others become men in name against us it seems that we are the enemies of mankind the elite shows itself in its true coloursit is nothing more than a gang our precious sets of values begin to moult on closer scrutiny you wont see one that isnt stained with blood if you are looking for an example remember these fine words how generous france is us generous what about setif then and those eight years of ferocious war which have cost the lives of over a million algerians and the tortures but let it be understood that nobody reproaches us with having been false to suchandsuch a missionfor the very good reason that we had no mission at all it is generosity itself thats in question this fine melodious word has only one meaning the granting of a statutory charter for the folk across the water new men freed men no one has the power nor the right to give anything to anybody for each of them has every right and the right to everything and when one day our human kind becomes fullgrown it will not define itself as the sum total of the whole worlds inhabitants but as the infinite unity of their mutual needs here i stop you will have no trouble in finishing the job all you have to do is to look our aristocratic virtues straight in the face for the first and last time they are cracking up how could they survive the aristocracy of underlings who brought them into being a few years ago a bourgeois colonialist commentator found only this to say in defence of the west we arent angels but we at least feel some remorse what a confession formerly our continent was buoyed up by other means the parthenon chartres the rights of man or the swastika now we know what these are worth and the only chance of our being saved from shipwreck is the very christian sentiment of guilt you can see its the end europe is springing leaks everywhere what then has happened it simply is that in the past we made history and now it is being made of us the ratio of forces has been inverted decolonisation has begun all that our hired soldiers can do is to delay its completion the old mother countries have still to go the whole hog they still have to engage their entire forces in a battle which is lost before it has begun at the end of the adventure we again find that colonial brutality which was bugeauds  doubtful glory but though it has been multiplied tenfold its still not enough the national service units are sent to algeria and they remain there seven years with no result violence has changed its direction when we were victorious we practised it without its seeming to alter us it broke down the others but for us men our humanism remained intact united by their profits the peoples of the mother countries baptised their commonwealth of crimes calling them fraternity and love today violence blocked everywhere comes back on us through our soldiers comes inside and takes possession of us involution starts the native recreates himself and we settlers and europeans ultras and liberals we break up rage and fear are already blatant they show themselves openly in the niggerhunts in algiers now which side are the savages on where is barbarism nothing is missing not even the tomtoms the motorhorns beat out algerie frangaise while the europeans bum moslems alive fanon reminds us that not so very long ago a congress of psychiatrists was distressed by the criminal propensities of the native population those people kill each other they said that isnt normal the algerians cortex must be underdeveloped in central africa others have established that the african makes very little use of his frontal lobes these learned men would do well today to follow up their investigations in europe and particularly with regard to the french for we too during the last few years must be victims of frontal sluggishness since our patriots do quite a bit of assassinating of their fellowcountrymen and if theyre not at home they blow up their house and their concierge this is only a beginning civil war is forecast for the autumn or for the spring of next year yet our lobes seem to be in perfect condition is it not rather the case that since we cannot crush the natives violence comes back on its tracks accumulates in the very depths of our nature and seeks a way out the union of the algerian people causes the disunion of the french people throughout the whole territory of the exmothercountry the tribes are dancing their wardances the terror has left africa and is settling here for quite obviously there are certain furious beings who want to make us pay with our own blood for the shame of having been beaten by the native then too there are the others all the others who are equally guilty for after bizerta after the lynchings of september who among them came out into the streets to shout weve had enough but less spectacularthe liberals and the toughs of the tender left the fever is mounting amongst them too and resentment at the same time and they certainly have the wind up they hide their rage in myths and complicated rites in order to stave off the day of reckoning and the need for decision they have put at the head of our affairs a grand magician whose business it is to keep us all in the dark at all costs nothing is being done violence proclaimed by some disowned by others turns in a vacuum one day it bursts out at metz the next at bordeaux its here there and everywhere like in a game of hunt the slipper its our turn to tread the path step by step which leads down to native level but to become natives altogether our soil must be occupied by a formerly colonised people and we must starve of hunger this wont happen for its a discredited colonialism which is taking hold on us this is the senile arrogant master who will straddle us here he comes our mumbojumbo and when you have read fanons last chapter you will be convinced that it would be better for you to be a native at the uttermost depths of his misery than to be a former settler it is not right for a police official to be obliged to torture for ten hours a day at that rate his nerves will fall to bits unless the torturers are forbidden in their own interests to work overtime when it is desirable that the morality of the nation and the army should be protected by the rigours of the law it is not right that the former should systematically demoralise the latter nor that a country with a republican tradition should confide hundreds and thousands of its young folk to the care of putschist officers it is not right my fellowcountrymen you who know very well all the crimes committed in our name its not at all right that you do not breathe a word about them to anyone not even to your own soul for fear of having to stand in judgement on yourself i am willing to believe that at the beginning you did not realise what was happening later you doubted whether such things could be true but now you know and still you hold your tongues eight years of silence what degradation and your silence is all of no avail today the blinding sun of torture is at its zenith it lights up the whole country under that merciless glare there is not a laugh that does not ring false not a face that is not painted to hide fear or anger not a single action that does not betray our disgust and our complicity it is enough today for two french people to meet together for there to be a dead man between them one dead man did i say in other days france was the name of a country we should take care that in  it does not become the name of a nervous disease will we recover yes for violence like achilles lance can heal the wounds that it has inflicted today we are bound hand and foot humiliated and sick with fear we cannot fall lower happily this is not yet enough for the colonialist aristocracy it cannot complete its delaying mission in algeria until it has first finished colonising the french every day we retreat in front of the battle but you may be sure that we will not avoid it the killers need it theyll go for us and hit out blindly to left and right thus the day of magicians and fetishes will end you will have to fight or rot in concentration camps this is the end of the dialectic you condemn this war but do not yet dare to declare yourselves to be on the side of the algerian fighters never fear you can count on the settlers and the hired soldiers theyll make you take the plunge then perhaps when your back is to the wall you will let loose at last that new violence which is raised up in you by old oftrepeated crimes but as they say thats another story the history of mankind the time is drawing near i am sure when we will join the ranks of those who make it
