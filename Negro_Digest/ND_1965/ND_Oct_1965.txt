the negro half a man in a white world
during the harlem riots last summer a black boy with tears streaming down his face taunted the police shoot me shoot another nigger when they did not comply he moaned im not even man enough for them to kill what the hysterical youth was expressing was the psychological castration which faces the negro male every day of his life in which he is barred from attaining the traditional american ideal of manhood dorothy canfield fisher states that our society puts negro youth in the situation of the animal in the psychological laboratory in which a neurosis is caused by making it impossible for him to live up to our national ideals as others do those glorified ideals of manhood are providing security and protection for ones family fighting injustice striving towards success with honesty defending individual liberty ones honor and ones country but for the negro physical and psychological violence leaps at him from every side to restrict these manly pursuits historically the emasculation of the negro began with slavery negro families were not only separated forcibly when they were brought to this country but continually throughout slavery as they were sold on the trading blocks whitney young of the national urban league points out that the negro family is the only ethnic group in world history which a consistent and deliberate effort has tried to weaken and destroy even after slavery young says the negro male was consciously kept at a lowpaying level and humiliated daily to prevent him from getting out of place and attempting to affect change after the slave trade was abolished by congress in  fear that the supply of slaves would become exhausted led to promiscuous breeding as an economic measure john hay lincolns biographer wrote that virginia was converted into a great menagerie where men were reared like oxen for the market and young negroes called stud men were treated as prize bulls in black odyssey roi ottley relates that these stud men were carefully fed exercised regularly    and subject to as little brutality as possible one named joe who lived on fayette jacksons place was considered bout de breedingest nigger in virginia joe had no work to do he was allowed to stay in his quarters and sun himself until called for his duties nine months after one weekend in a suffolk nursery  babies were born on the same day to women with whom he had been mated ottley also reveals that maryland enterprisingly brought out a fancy line of stockchildren of indentured white girls mated with stud men undoubtedly licentiousness among breeders played no small part in the mulatto production which incidentally gave maryland traders a jump on their competitors negro studs were treated like precious animals but not like men throughout the ages notes playwright leroi jones one race of mankind has enslaved another but the victim was still considered a man it was left to the christians of the new world to dehumanize the negro and read him entirely out of the human race this dehumanization was reinforced in  by the constitution which labeled the negro three fifths of a man in  the supreme court stated in the dred scott decision that negroes were so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect in  a book published by the american book and bible house the negroa beast popular among churchgoing whites argued that the negro was not the son of ham or even the descendant of adam and eve but simply a beast without a soul if the negro studs were dehumanized the other slaves fared no better along family lines marriages were ignored if performed at all and paternity was not recognized children were traced through the mother the unity of the family was destroyed to facilitate the buying and selling of individual slaves only the most elementary motherchild unit with the father absent unknown or if present incapable of wielding any influence was allowed to survive unlike the negro male who had only utilitarian value the negro woman had more opportunity for emotional interaction with the whites for two reasons one was as negro mammy to white children and the other was as a sex object the plethora of laws prohibiting marriages between the races is eloquent testimony that the white man found the negro woman sexually attractive physical compulsion was often necessary to compel compliance of the woman and historical evidence  is plentiful on this point j a tragic example is the love story of benjamin banneker astronomer and mathematician as told in his biography your most humble servant by shirley graham banneker constructed one of the first clocks made in america and assisted in the survey of washington d c born a free negro during slavery banneker fell in love with the beautiful slave girl anola and sought to buy her to make her his wife but when her master saw anola he wanted every sweet curving inch of her for himself anola outsmarted her master by drowning herself in consoling banneker an old slave woman told him she be free now son    ole massa nevah make huh his slave dey stole huh body and dey lock huh up from you but she wan you to know dis one thing she free to die   in proud shoes pauli murray relates the rape of her great grandmother harriet a slave married to reuben day a free negro when her owners son desired her harriet was brutally beaten and raped but before that reuben day was ambushed by the two white brothers who whipped him to ii deaths door and ran him off the plantation    in other instances the mere prestige of the white race was sufficient to gain consent from  negro women they felt such selfcontempt that a drop of white blood in their offspring raised them in the scale of humanity then too the white master was the protector as well as the oppressor and as such was an idealized as well as a hated figure often there were concrete advantages to be gained by a negro womans surrender in some cases it meant freedom from the drudgery of field labor and elevation to house slave and there was the hope that her mulatto children would enjoy added privileges from their white father and might even be emancipated this usefulness of the female as a concubine increased the white mans fear of her legitimate mate the negro male his fear of retaliation led to the fantastic exaggeration in his mind of the negro males sexual ability and the need to protect white women from him this guilt and anxiety necessitated even more repressive measures against the negro man during reconstruction peonage reduced the negro to nearbondage and the threat of sudden death kept him in his place western mobs preferred hanging and southern mobs delighted in burning in  the memphis press printed a graphic description of the lynching of ed pierson fifteen thousand men women and children cheered as they poured the gasoline on the ax fiend and struck the match they fought and screamed and crowded to get a glimpse of him and the mob closed in as the flames flared high and the smoke rolled about their heads    the negro lay in flames his hands crossed on his chest if he spoke no one heard him over the shouts of the crowd he died quickly though fifteen minutes later excitable persons still shouted that he lived when they saw the charred remains move as does meat on a hot frying pan a mob near valdosta georgia lynched three innocent negroes when they could not find the man they sought for murdering a plantation owner as told by langston hughes in the story of the naacp the pregnant wife of one of the three wailed at her husbands death so loudly that the mob seized her and burned her alive too as the flames enveloped mary turners body her unborn child fell to the ground and was trampled underfoot white parents held their children up to watch during the  years from  to  the naacp records that  men and women were lynched    the negro man already treated by the white majority as less tnan a man is further depreciated by his women because of his uncertain employment more than  per cent of the negro labor force is in the three lowest occupations as compared to  per cent of white workers the unemployment rate for negro mens  times greater than for whites onehalf or the negro families in america receive  a week or less money income compared with  a week for white families the negro womans chance for employment is better than the mans there is always a demand for domestic work and she has greater opportunity to complete her education the negro working class woman holds the purse strings she usually works until  much longer than does her white counterpart this difference expresses the greater economic security of the white male negro women head the family in one out of five families as compared to one in eleven for whites the negro woman loses respect for her husband whose economic condition prevents him from acting according to the accepted white ideals she is frustrated in her feminine wishes to have a man stronger than she and often betrays these feelings in contempt for the man this contempt is reflected in sissie a novel by john a williams when her husband cant find work sissie wonders at what point had she become the man and he less the man he had seemed to be when sissie tells her husband that they will have to move to a cheaper flat with no furnace and shes going to take in washing at home he explodes im a f   g man    whats making it so that i cant be one because masculinity is closely tied to power in every form in our society the negro interprets his  economic failure as a loss in masculinity his frantic efforts to maintain a dominant position in the family often end in failure and despondency leading to divorce or desertion accounting for the high number of broken families particularly in the lower classes and the negro father who abandons his family is himself likely to have been the product of a broken home or one damaged by a weak father image a youngsters strong identification with respected and loved parents enables him to control eventually his rebellious feelings but for many a negro child the father cannot be idealized as protector and provider for he is neither parents cannot help their children gain status and social and economic satisfaction for the parents themselves are members of a despised group their ideal is spoiled by the stigma of inferiority in a broken home situation the negro boy is often reared by his mother and grandmother in an atmosphere which does not exalt masculinity on the contrary these frustrated women often make disparaging remarks about the inadequacies of the negro male making it impossible for the boy to identify with a positive father image and derive self esteem from such identification often he is brutally informed that he is no good just like his father inner tensions accumulate and the home fails to be a protective environment the boy feels frustrated dependency and hostility rage however the certain knowledge that he will be punished if his hatred is discovered produces guilt for having such emotions in order to survive the negro suppresses his rage replacing it with submission or ingratiation while scraping and bowing may save his life they help to murder his manhood deeply frustrated by his ego deflating role and unable to express his hostility toward whites the lower class negro often unleashes his fury in violent attacks on other negroes to bolster his bruised ego he may dress flamboyantly straighten his kinky hair prove to himself that he is not invisible a magical aid to selfesteem is gambling where he has the chance of beating fate of being the favored one if just for a day or he may seek escape from his intolerable situation in alcohol narcotics and crime all negroes do not succumb to these problems those raised in stable homes are generally able to develop psychological resources to withstand these effects but discrimination and segregation create a type of family disorganization which causes many negroes to be especially vulnerable nor is the middle class negro exempt from a loss of masculinity he goes through the same cycle of suppressed rage guilt and self rejection because despite his wealth and education and conformity to middle class standards he is not accepted by white society  e franklin frazier states in black bourgeoisie negro men are frustrated because they cannot assert themselves or exercise power as white men do    the conservative and conventional middle class husband often sits at home alone impotent physically and socially and complains that his wife has gone crazy about poker and society and constantly demands money for gambling and expenditures which he cannot afford ignored by the dominant society they engage in an intense struggle for status reflected in their conspicuous consumption of material goods in an attempt to compensate for the contempt of the whites frazier also notes that in the south the middle class negro male is not only prevented from playing a masculine role but generally must let negro women assume leadership in any show of militancy this demoralizes his status in the home and further emasculates him dr abram kardiner and dr lionel ovesey psychiatrist and sociologist who pooled their resources while both were on the staff of columbia university to conduct a study on the personality of the negro observed there is not one personality trait of the negro the source of which cannot be traced to his difficult living condition there are no exceptions to this rule the final result is a wretched internal life negro self esteem cannot be retrieved nor negro selfhatred destroyed as long as the status is quo    they can never be eradicated without removing the forces that create and perpetuate them    what is needed by the negro is not education but reintegration it is the white man who requires the education    although the negro has fought valiantly in every american war he has been discriminated against in every war and this has been a frustrating blow to his manhood last december a special committee reported to president johnson that discrimination still exists in overseas military bases and that the national guard segregates negroes ami not a soldier a man and a brother not if you are black america answered on the eve of world war ii a negro could die for his country but he had to do so in certain restricted menial jobs in the navy and coast guard in two infantry and one cavalry regiments in the army he was excluded from the army air corps the marine corps and from the tank signal engineer and artillery corps of the army in  yancy williams a howard university student filed suit to compel the war department to consider him for the lilywhite army air corps the naacp was threatening lawsuits against local education boards which provided vocational defense training for whites but excluded negroes when pearl harbor was bombed the naacp issued a call to all negro citizens to support the war effort in the south where most of the negro troops were sent for their basic training a negro soldier who entered a white uso or service club might be arrested and court martialed southern police and civilians inflicted brutal treatment upon the negro gis who were ordered by their commanding officers not to retaliate they were beaten shot and murdered in southern railway station restaurants german prisoners of war were served promptly while the negroes guarding them often had to go hungry the negro soldier bitterly wondered who really was his enemy twenty six thousand white workers making bomber engines at a packard motor plant in detroit in  went out on strike in protest against the employment of negroes a striker in front of the plant yelled id rather see hitler and hirohito win the war than work beside a nigger on the assembly line that summer a bitter race riot held up war production for two days overseas the situation between white and black troops bordered on armed warfare in guam a long series of attacks upon negro service units led to an investigation by the naacp stones and hand grenades were repeatedly hurled into the negro camp and a band of marines ran negroes out of agana when two drunken marines killed a negro soldier on christmas day in  and later a machine gun loaded onto a jeep sprayed bullets into the negro camp the negro soldiers decided they had had enough they boarded a truck but were arrested before they reached agana charged with rioting attempted murder theft of government property and unlawful assembly they were court martialed and sentenced to prison the naacp took the case all the way to the white house before the verdict was finally reversed not until the battle of the bulge in december  did white and black soldiers serve together but in separate platoons negro riflemen were moved into the white divisions of the first and seventh armies general patton and general eisenhower praised these colored troops all of whom had volunteered for combat duty and major general lathan told the riflemen i have never seen any soldiers who performed better in combat than you many of them lost their lives but when a movie spectacular recorded the heroic deeds of this invasion recently not one negro soldier was portrayed the red cross was also rigid in upholding jim crow it offered separate and inferior recreational facilities for negro troops and at first refused to accept blood from  negro donors for its blood bank ironically the blood plasma project was originated by a negro dr charles drew later the red cross accepted negro blood but segregated it according to the wishes of congressman john rankin of mississippi who claimed that not to separate the plasma was a communist plot to mongrelize america at the wars end parades and brass bands welcomed the white war hero the familiar pattern of violence and intimidation greeted the negro isaac woodward jr discharged from the army only a few hours earlier was on his way home when he had his eyes gouged out in batesburg south carolina by the chief of police the atlanta daily world in georgia commented on november   that some atlanta police are reported to be beating up discharged and disabled negro veterans at the slightest provocation and practicing a gettheminlinewiththepostwarattitude  am l not a veteran a brother and a man the answer was still no    the negro has a long list of grievances he complains of police brutality inequality before the law and complex social discrimination which closes to him doors of opportunities which are open to others poverty condemns him to inferior housing health and schools his lack of education confines him to the least desirable jobs his low status deprives him of political equality his lack of equality degrades him and confirms his separatedness from whites who gain in selfesteem if in no other way than through his debasement at every turn this vicious cycle stalks him standing between him and the cherished ideals of american manhood today the emergence of the african nations has helped rescue the color black from the outhouse giving the negro a new sense of dignity writers like james baldwin are telling the negro to find his own identity and tohellwithemulatingwhites in a recent look article he said white people seem to ask us if they ask us anything come into my nightmare with me be like me have abortions like me instead of illegitimate children but we dont want to be like you there is no reason whatever for negroes to want to enter white society nurtured on the disillusionment of their wartime parents todays generation is increasingly aware of its psychological handicaps and determined to grind to a halt the resultant chain reaction nonviolently or otherwise that is why the negro laughs with derision when wellintentioned but unthinking people tell him hes going too fast how can one go too fast to prevent even one little black boy from becoming half a man in a white world
the negro woman exj ploited by white men t jl  and women resented eereais and brutalized by her own men of color has marched down through the pages of history proud and unbowed by all the indignities heaped upon her by every segment of a truly hostile society in a nation that is largely antifemale and totally antinegro the negro woman has almost singlehandedly kept her family together mainly on coolie wages and in most instances has brought her children up to be hardworking lawabiding citizens but has she received any credit for her wellnigh impossible achievements certainly not if historically white america has either ignored or lynched the black male it has used and abused the black female with all the vigorous cruelty of an incredibly vicious people yet without exception this nation has blamed the delinquency of our black slum children on the working negro mother instead of placing the blame where it squarely belongs on its own bigoted shoulders and likewise these experts never blink an eyelash when its pointed out that there is as much delinquency among the middle and upperclass white youths whose mothers do not work and in reality there is more speaking in actual percentages but money and unorthodox police methods manage to hush much of it up but despite these concealments all honest observers are deeply concerned over the cancerous state of this so called affluent society and how ironical that this nation was so rapacious it could not forsee that to enslave murder rape maim and rob a whole race of people would surely one day cast its evil spell on the entire country corrupting its favored children and their children and their childrens children then too in this lilywhite society simply being black is reason enough for nabbing many of our negro males of all ages on suspicion and hauling them down to the precinct where an appalling number wind up with cracked heads compliments of the uniformed racist thugs who cruise this infected land north and south east and west night and day forever and ever and what have our black experts had to say about our courageous unsung heroine since slavery time our families have been mostly matriarchal many of them cry happily though in the new industrial class and expanding middleclass larger numbers of negro men are assuming dominant family roles these experts exult in the next breath neither economic necessity nor tradition has instilled in the negro woman the spirit of subordination to masculine authority the late e franklin frazier once wrote obviously none of our black male experts seem to realize that the concept of male supremacy is as reprehensible and obsolescent as is the concept of white supremacy which they have always so eloquently railed against indeed one of our most renown negro authors had one of his female characters exclaim more than once in his book im just another colored girl to these white people nowhere did he have any of his male characters say im just another colored man it is plain to see that this author doesnt realize the negro woman as do other human beings always thinks of herself as being just that a human being it is only to our illustrous black author and his bigoted white countrymen that she is thought of as being something other than a real person to be sure our social scientists aping their white colleagues who spend much of their time extolling the virtues of motherhood and female servitude to the male never miss an opportunity to throw brickbats at the negro woman one such authority complained bitterly that the negro woman doesnt want to be financially dependent on the male well why should she since she is neither child nor serf nor idiot because no matter how its dressed up and this nation has an astonishing ability when it comes to finding euphemisms for evil thus slavery has become the peculiar institution and murder if your victim is black is not murder but a deprivation of civil_rights being financially dependent on anyone is to be indentured to that person or group surely these experts must know that inasmuch as theyve largely been dependent on the white man for nearly four centuries and remain at the very bottom of the social and economic structure and are sinking lower if such can be imagined and these same bucolic authorities let out anguished cries of outrage when they note that many negro women have outstripped the black male in certain areas instead of giving credit to the female and encouragement to the male and female for goodness knows our people are far far behind in virtually all fields in this great society these th century theoreticians seek to elevate the black man by  debasing the female of course as has often been pointed out no group is really desirous of other groups becoming its equal they are concerned with being superior however and this is especially true of the majority of negro men in america being secondclass citizens themselves they are hellbent on making sure the female remains subservient to the male and when the negro woman rejects this intolerable situation for there is no more unendurable hell on earth than that of being a doormats doormat she is called unwomanly castrative or masculine by our black and white experts and just as an overwhelming majority of white people become outraged whenever black people aspire to anything above the mop and bucket brigade so do all except an extremely small number of men become incensed when any female seeks to shun the shackles of the kitchen and make her way in the world at large and this is doubly true for the negro woman who remarkably has taken these obstacles in her stride and is even now demonstrating in ever increasing numbers that her brain is as good as  anyone elses and that she intends to utilize it to the utmost labels and namecalling she realizes are for the frightened and the insecure to take refuge behind and like sticks and stones she knows they can neither break her spirit nor stop her march through history as one of our most enduring examples of courage for all time
hazards of forming a single rights group
night is turned to day in the glare of the bombs a mighty cannon roars and men and earth are replaced by a gaping holea giant period that marks an end to the statement of life sighs of the dying mingle with cries of the living but both are drowned out by the screaming shells a mans finger slowly squeezes the trigger and his rifle barks a question a ball of lead speeds toward its target seeking an answer it finds its mark in a human heart and the answer is death this is warhotwise words and pictures change mens ideologies and beliefs the intangible fingers of propaganda reach out and capture their minds  an upheaval in politics gives birth to another revolution a little island  miles off the florida shore is our enemy and another  miles from the western coast is our friend democracy and communism vie in a contest to make leaders look east or west in this contest the soldiers are replaced by diplomats and the guns give way to words this too is warcoldwise that vacancy is filled insists the personnel manager and a man keeps walking come back tomorrow says the foreman and a man must move on there are no openings at present a negro college graduate is told in these ways are the long unemployment lines formed and the men who face deceit who stand in those lines and walk those streets are citizens of the richest nation in the world but they are denied entrance into the mainstream of the good life the doors close in their faces the employers turn them away and they must struggle to survive from day to day when all the tokens for the busses and subways are gone they walk the streets in despair searching for ways to earn their fare this is yet another warjobwise yet important as it is the latter war is only one phase of the negro revolution as we all are aware there exist numerous other phases such as education housing and use of public facilities now with so many prime fronts to be attacked does it not seem tactically feasible to have a number of groups prepared to assault those fronts for example consider the air force army and navy they are separate branches of the united states military establishment but during times of war they all coordinate their efforts to defeat the common enemy the fact that the negro revolution embraces different groups with unlike methods is certainly not a hindrance in itself conflict normally arises only when one group criticizes anothers philosophy or methods essentially the goal that they all seek to attain is the same on the contrary it is the methods and philosophies that vary yet as other wars and other revolutions have proven it takes a variety of efforts to obtain even a single victory history tells us that the roads were varied and many but they all led to rome though the sights and sounds on each were different they all ended at an identical place so may the various civil_rights groups lead us down different paths by different methods to the same destinationequality for every man and if each of us chooses to follow a separate group that should not detract from our progress after all as individuals we all differ and the sights and sounds of a particular road may attract one and repel another but let us not criticize those who go by a road other than the one we travel for we all shall meet in rome by and by now let us suppose that all negro revolutionists began traveling the same roador more aptly suppose that the civil_rights groups were to merge forces such an action would naturally raise many psychological and practical questionsquestions that should be answered long before the action is initiated it is certain that a merger would produce numerous organizational problems we need not concern ourselves with specific descriptions of those problems but only with their effect in zen buddhism there is a belief that small children always look at the finger which points rather than at the thing to which it points it is fact that most adults also become much more preoccupied by the pointer than by that to which it points if now the civil_rights groups were to merge would it not generate many complex organizational details like the people described in zen buddhism would the combined groups involvement with the finger of detail cause them to lose sight of the ultimate goal for the danger is that they might become so wrapped in the cloak of organizational complexity that they will devote more time to the finger than to the fight moreover as various demonstrations have shown emotions are the very substance of the negro revolution for our struggle involves a great deal of idealism and idealism is primarily based on emotions though tempered with a certain amount of objectivity emotionalism remains the moving force for instance consider the great march on washington though conceived and executed in an objective manner it still depended on emotionalism for its accomplishment only emotions could have bridged the gap between such a conglomeration of people and caused them to cooperate with so much success no doubt there are those among us who can remember when the corner grocery store was an intimate friendly place it was there that we stood and swapped stories and joked with the proprietor say mr jones then as the store grew larger we noticed that mr jones had no more time for jokes and began casting disapproving glances at those who came primarily to stand and talk and as the store became larger and larger our standing talking and joking were no longer tolerated even that simple example serves to show that the larger an organization grows the more objective it must become to operate effectively so may the merged civil_rights groups move to a higher plane of objectivity the question which arises is this would such a move cause a decline of emotions in their thinking and activities if so a great deal would indeed be lost also to be considered are those participants who have allied themselves with one particular group as stated previously the sights and sounds of a single road may attract one and repel another so a reason able assumption is that some individuals are not only committed to achieving the ultimate goal of the negro revolution but are also committed to certain leaders principles concepts methods and other facets of a specific group and in committing themselves to the latter they have probably established identities with their chosen group and have developed certain images regarding their role in the civil_rights battle since a merger would result in the groups being united indistinw f i guishably it is likely that such a union would precipitate an entirely new group image which would differ from any of those projected by the present organizations it is apparent then that a great many persons would have to realign themselves with the new union and would also have to create fresh images of their roles but when faced with the actual transition how many would or could willfully and completely cast off the old images and identificationshow many would or could attain and maintain the new ones and mainly how many would lose the old and reject or find unattainable the new finally how many would be left to flounder in the clutches of confusion and be left with nothing at all let us also briefly consider the leadership aspect if one of the present leaders were elected to head the group would the effectiveness of the remaining ones be somewhat impededwould their personalities be somewhat impaired as previously indicated some participants are especially allied with certain leaders and if those leaders were given seemingly lesser roles than they now have would their staunch supporters tend to resent that subordination would their resentment manifest itself in covert rebellion against the newly elected leader and in a general lessening of interest and effort regarding the combined activity it is probable that such manifestations would tend towards anarchy and would detract from the overall effectiveness of the group itself though this limited inquiry points toward the many questions and problems that would probably arise from a complete merger of the current civil_rights groups it is not meant to discourage or demean cooperation between those groups after all if the branches of the u s military can function effectively under a department of defense it seems feasible that the various rights groups could also operate properly under a similar authority for if the leaders of those groups would come together and form let us say a council of coordination many questions and problems in cooperation would no doubt be eliminated they could then coordinate their efforts and plan a common strategy which would determine what targets are to be assaulted and which group would be primarily responsible for the assault this strategy would evolve from the locale of the target the required number of participants the best method of attack and other pertinent factors on the basis of such plans it appears that they could attack each separate front without duplicating efforts and without coming into conflict with one another even though the negros struggle has spawned various groups could not the philosophies and methods of each be accepted and applied towards a successful end to our great venture for it is only fitting and proper that we use every legal and honorable means to succeed in our endeavor now is the time when we like shakespeares character should realize that there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their lives shall be bound in shallows and miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current as it serves or lose our ventures 
american history j  abounds with success  £ stories v£ they range from the fictional exploits of horatio alger to the very nonfictional success of andrew carnegie who rose from his start as a poor scottish immigrant to amass one of this countrys greatest fortunes we also have albert e watson im not equating watson with the legendary alger or the superaffluent carnegie but he does have his own cinderellalike success story its the story of how watson rose from a doortodoor sweetmeat salesman in the bayou country of louisiana to the owner of a successful meat processing plant in los angeles watsons success is also the story of what we at the small business administration are doing to help develop a strong stable negro middle class by helping negroes survive in the sharply competitive world of small business albert watsons new meat plant was tooled with the latest equipment in the trade his home is in baldwin hills suburban area which has its scattering of private swimming pools and boasts of a panoramic view of the city but for the year old watson it hasnt always been that way he started out as a small boy knocking on doors in houma louisiana selling unwanted byproductssuch as liver hearts and brainsfrom a nearby meat packing firm he combined his initiative skill salesmanship and assistance from the small business administration into his present operation with its  employees at the age of  he learned the trade of boning meats and for the next  years he worked for a number of packing and processing firms learning more and more about the business while working he took care of his education by going to school at night his teachers started him in the seventh grade in  and four years later he had received his high school diploma and had launched himself in college eventually he got a diploma from pepperdine college where he majored in business administration and american history in  watson decided to bew come his own boss his first business venture was a single table cutting his own meats in six months his business expanded and he had to move to larger quarters after six months he moved again in  he came to sb a to borrow  to again expand his business he repaid the loan in full in  and a little later again borrowed from sba this time   the largest cash loan ever made by sba to a negro businessman this loan financed his new plant  although it shows dramatically what can be done in business unfortunately albert watsons success is not typical of the negro small businessman the condition of these businessmen is shown by a single set of statistics negroes represent about  per cent of the national population but they own less than two per cent of the nations  million small businesses and the businesses that negroes do own have only about half the income of their white counterparts on top of this they have an extremely difficult time getting credit for expanding modernizing or starting a new business there is an urgent need to inject a massive economic stimulus into our negro population centers as a means of developing economic power among negroes this power isneeded not only to assure the survival of small businessmen but to provide the core of a healthy negro middle class which has been described as the stabilizer and social harmonizer since i became sba administrator in august  we have been trying to break the ice that has long frozen the negro small businessman into an inadequately and ghettoized pattern of operation i think we have made considerable progress in this direction but we dont have the luxury of indefinite time to establish a viable negro small business class it is ironic that the civil_rights legislation which seeks to insure equal social and legal rights for our negro citizens also puts the pressure on the negro in the market place in enacting these safeguards of justice and equality the law weakens the wall which has long protected the negro businessman oriented toward the negro customer from white competition the negro small businessmans enterprise grew out of the segregation pattern and in its present form is almost entirely dependent upon it gradually as this pattern disappearsand it is in many areasthe negro small businessman must cut his racial ties and move out into the mainstream of commerce it is one of the major missions of our agency to assist in this process considerable progress has been made i believe that the reason we have progressed in this effort is because we view it not as simply a way of helping a business but also because we are seeking to help the individual behind the business and we are working to build a force for stability progress and creativity in a deprived community what specifically are we doing first we are providing credit on terms that emphasize a mans character rather than his collateral and at a reasonable rate of interest that will take him out of the grips of the loan sharks initially this took the form of what we call the  by  program  loans up to  for  years it was started in philadelphia on a pilot basis in january  the chief purpose was to make financial assistance available to the very very small businessman particularly the negro who found it virtually impossible to get credit from the traditional loan sources we also felt that many negro small businessmen who had the ingredients for success were unable to meet the more stringent requirements of sbas regular loan programs for example in the decade prior to setting up the  by  program only seven loans to negro businessmen had been made in philadelphia in just one year of operation of the special program  such loans totaling  were made in philadelphia to negro businessmen interestingly enough one of these philadelphia loans is probably the smallest federal loan made in this billiondollar era the loan for  went to help two young women start a childrens day nursery for the working wives of the neighborhood in another case again in philadelphia a  by  loan made it possible for a year old father to go into business for himself the young man after going to school to study automobile transmission repair went to the bank to borrow money to take over his fathers auto repair garage because of debts he was turned down instead of being discouraged he went to work to pay off the debts and came to sba for a loan impressed by his ambition and the fact that he went out and earned the money to repaydebts we made a loan of  for his business the  by  success story was repeated in several other large cities where the pilot program was set up to meet negro businessmens needs we were most gratified by the success of the program we were even more pleased when the  by  program became the basis of title iv of the economic opportunity actbetter known as the war on poverty legislation this section adopted the character principle of the  by  programbut on an expanded basis the legislation raised the loan limits to a maximum of  for  years again negroes were quick to respond to the broadened program and the first economic opportunity loan by sba went to a negro bakery cooperative in louisiana and one of the first community organizations set up to screen these loans for sba was established in harlem while we are pleased with the reception these programs have received we are not confining our assistance to negroes to special devicesas the watson loan shows and we are not seeking a strictly money answer to the problem of helping the small businessman in our efforts to provide a wide range of assistance and services to the negro business community we have established the office of special assistance for minority groups this post is held by randall l tyrus through his office  sba makes a concerted and sustained effort to stay in personal contact with the negro leaders and organizations sharing our concern about the future of the negro business community and our desire to do something about it this liaison has resulted in substantial benefits in many areas and has led to direct cooperation between sba and negro leaders to set up active financial and management assistance programs for those needing such help recently i had the pleasure to appoint the first negro regional director for the small business administration james bruce llewellyn who has full charge of all sba activities in  cities of eastern and southern new york including all of long island and staten island as regional director he will be in charge of  employees including  technicians his region has an estimated  small businesses many of which look to sba for financial and other assistance we feel that we have made a sound beginning toward providing sustained effective assistance to negro small businessmen and by widening our horizons beyond this task we are seeking to make our agency a model of equal employment opportunities for the nations youth there is no certainty that our efforts will result in the story of albert watsons becoming typical but we are confident that we  are on the road to making his story less unusual
in  hollywood released one of the most chilling movies of all time the invasion of the body snatchers grown men and women trembled even fainted as they watched giant podlike creatures from outer space duplicate individual humans and irresistibly insinuate themselves into the bodies of sleeping americans the transformation was undetectablethe victims looked sounded and moved as they had before but they were actually the spirits of the pods invested in human bodies and naturally in their dealings with earthlings their sole aim was to help a fellow creature become similarly incorporated until the whole earth became their home but the audienceonce out of the theater at leastrecognized this as a piece of fiction in  however just two years later a former massachusetts candy bar businessman claimed that humanlike creatures called communists possessing neither consciences nor morals had taken over about  per cent of america whether or not this man saw the horror movie is not determined but whatever his inspiration he asserted that any one of these communists can control or convert a hundred to a thousand completely misguided americans furthermore he continued it is almost impossible for the ordinary citizen to recognize these communists because they are too slippery for you to put your fingers on them in the ordinary way  he doesnt wear any label he usually lives up to the appearance of excellent morals   and you will usually find him in church on sunday morning maybe even a catholic church but as a member of the united states senate running for the presidency and smart enough to know the strong communist support behindthescenes which he will have to have to get nominated in  such an amoral man can do a tremendous amount of ballcarrying on behalf of the communist aims here in the united states these are the words of robert welch founder of the john birch society a master of the halftruth and implicit smear welch directs suspicion fear and hatred against any group or individual opposed to the reactionary rightwing in the quoted passage for example welch does not make the propagandists mistake of naming anyone who fits the description of a catholic senator running for the  presidential nomination yet his description fits only one man in the history of the world the late john f kennedy whose memory said a birch leader will be cherished with distaste of course the slain president is not the only one doused with the birchers red paint one learns from them that martin_luther_king jr dwight eisenhower john foster dulles albert einstein earl warren adlai stevenson humphrey bogart eleanor roosevelt and countless others with hardly anything in common are dedicated or manipulated agents of a communist conspiracy to subjugate the world through fallacies and falsehoods undetected by the untrained or muddled minds of their often wellmeaning followers birch leaders convince their gullible flock that communists are behind the civil_rights movement the un income tax fluoridation of water sex education the supreme court the clergy the press congressin short they are told that communists control the country how can so many americans believe the birch barking one reason is fear for fear is the child of ignorance and superstition and birch leaders preach to each member that more than half the people he sees may be suspected as members of a conspiracy to enslave him this fear begets hatred and intensifies the alltoohuman weakness of fearing hating and attacking ideas and people unfamiliar to or different from oneself a man who believes he is threatened by something he can neither see nor understand is a ready tool for the hands of demagogues and so upon learning that dag hammarskjold ralph bunche and former howard university president mordecai johnson have publicly advocated the doctrines of communism the confused young couples patriotic grandmothers zealous lawyers insecure immigrants tightfisted businessmen and hardbitten racists feel over whelmed and surrender their minds to powerhungry rightwingers sensitively aware that they are the butts of jokes and the victims of rash attacks birchers instinctively huddle together they enjoy thinking of themselves as an oppressed minority group of americanists but it is a mistake to ridicule or smear the birchers and a greater mistake moreover to ignore the fact that the dedicated core of leaders and organizers who plot and carry out the brainwashing of americans and sabotage of the constitution plan to inflict a repulsive tyrannical form of government on this country not only the fifth amendment but also the first freedom of speech religion press and assembly the sixth right to confront accusers in court fourteenth and fifteenth against voterdiscrimination  graduated income tax article four the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states and many other constitutional provisions would be subverted by the birchers armed with catchy slogans and an expanded budget they play upon the insecurity of many americans who have recently gained middle class status they help these citizens decline the responsibilities of their status by occupying much of their time with reading matter and cunning projects like writing birch letters to liberal industrialists jamming the lines of phonein radio programs distributing stickers support your local police removing books they dislike from libraries erecting billboards and infiltrating the pta but their main strategy now is secretly to foment racial strife and thereby discredit liberal politicians who pass legislation designed to bring about a more democratic and just relationship between black and white with an increasing number of policemen falling under their spell birch leaders know that it is relatively easy for them to set the races against each other and spark a riot not only without police intervention but perhaps with police collaboration and then in the confusion and hysteria the rightwing will offer to the white majority a candidate who promises to smother civil_rights and other liberal protests once and for all too many americans believe that true conservatives like the birchers could hardly be involved in such a foul scheme but despite the patrioticreligious sounding names of their many front groups the birchers are definitely not conservatives they are made up to look that way but it is hard to teach an old bawd new tricks and ever so often the cosmetic facade of a birch group melts down its face exposing the flesh underneath not only do they cavort with outspoken racists like lester maddox the atlanta exrestaurateur but also with men more powerful and competent than maddox and who constitute what has been called the militaryindustrial complex this complex of active and retired rightwing military and businessmen is similar to the group which brought hitler to power these are the rich men who are not used to being questioned men who do not think of their fellow citizens as political social or moral equals and who resist the struggles of the oppressed many of these men are white supremacists it is significant that the klan was founded by an exconfederate general a negrotrader nathan bedford forrest whose methods of driving people into the klan corral were almost identical to welchs birch tactics said forrest in  in each voting precinct there is a captain who  is required to make out a list of names of men in his precinct giving all the radicals and all the democrats good guys who are positively known and showing also the doubtful on both sides and of both colors this list of names is forwarded to the grand commander of the state who is thus enabled to know who are our friends and who are not said welch in  the john birch society will function almost entirely through small local chapters    each will have a chapter leader appointed by headquarters    another thing we should do and one badly needed would be to start shocking the american people    into a dawning realization of how far and how completely  communists and communist influences have crept right into communities institutions and activities where the general public does not have the slightest suspicion of such infiltration the best way to do this is by exposure which is why the communists just had to get rid of mccarthy the parallel is more meaningful when one notices that it is over racial problems the birchers most often trip sen james eastland mississippis bulwark is one of their experts on the american race problem and south carolinas strom thurmond is another birch booster the racist government of south africa is their prime example of a stable anticommunist regime and during the summer of  welch urged birchers to contribute to the coordinating committee for fundamental american freedoms which spent half a million dollars fighting the civil_rights bill this committee pumped  into a chicago polish newspaper alone thus by wooing policemen in big cities and by playing upon inferiority complexes of disadvantaged whites the birchers prove themselves adept at hitlerian tactics welch reveals his true nature in his a letter to the south on segregation addressing white people as he admits welch tells his followers that during the civil_rights movement a great many negroes are going to become very foolish indeed before this rising storm is over he tells his white readers that they form an elite and must meet the civil_rights advance with self control and constructive labor this is so far not rabid talk but a little further into the letter after implying that negroes use bathtubs less frequently than whites welch claims that the easygoing colored man of the south is being inflamed by communists the ordinary colored people of the south can easily be misled by clever agitators    but truly in most cases they know not what they do he then argues that the phrase civil_rights is actually a communist slogan and informs his readers that those who approvingly use the phrase are attempting to put on pressures that will force you to armed resistance with the appearance in the minds of most people not close enough to be truly informed of right and justice on their side communists according to welch forced negroes to seek the supreme court desegregation decision even though school integration embarrassed negroes certain negroes like the ones who worked around his fathers north carolina farm but never tried to eat beside him in a restaurant are approved by welch he approves of the rev j l ward leader of the prince of peace goodwill movement in memphis he even put rev wards picture in a widely published birch society circular rev ward says welch has common sense despite his considerable difficulties with his plurals and his tenses welch printed the following statement of rev wards as typical of the negro with common sense we are asking the negroes of the south in the publishing of this literature let us remember that the lord brought us this way through the leadership of our southern white friends who knows us who helps us who has built our schools who has helped our churches who has given their monies and some have given their lives the birchers also approve of the rev uriah j fields in  rev fields was a secretary of the montgomery improvement association unsatisfied with his role fields charged that rev martin_luther_king jr had misused funds collected to provide negroes with transportation during the bus boycott segregationists eagerly snapped up fields and he appeared as a witness for the prosecution before a grand jury which indicted king and  other negroes when it became obvious that the charges would be proved false fields retracted his accusation and apologized to the innocent civil_rights workers he was not sued because king believes law suits are incompatible with the philosophy of nonviolence now fields lives in los angeles and is a member of the birch societys speakers bureau which sends him around the country exposing the communist plot behind the civil_rights movement he fields must be doing well now says a la newswoman hes driving a big new cadillac  a negro woman mrs julia brown also of los angeles is another member of the societys speakers bureau denying that she is a member of the society mrs brown adds but i would consider it an honor birchers and their sympathizers enjoy mrs browns speeches in omaha neb she told them there are many communists working for negro voting rights because thats where the dirty work is so i can appreciate governor wallaces being tired of voting rights demonstrations    martin_luther_king jr and james farmer are aiding the communist conspiracy    the southern white man is the negros best friend mrs brown was once a paid informer for the fbi selling them information about alleged communists who were her former friends in the cleveland ohio i area other negroes whom the birchers have linked with themselves in the literature they pass out are the rev c fain kyle of richmond calif and his daughter gwendolyn  rev kyle heads a group called discard dedicated independent society committee against racial demonstrations inc another group called the conservative christian churches of america and five other predominantly onemanshows miss kyle received the birchers first annual  manning johnson scholarship award upon receiving it she told newsmen martin_luther_king is not what he appears  to be to many people  i think highly of the birch societyits doing a tremendous job telling the american people about the communist conspiracy in the civil_rights movement in america neither past present nor aspiring member of the society kyle says he has been used by birchers who figured that a negro conservative was a good drawing card kyle refused to become a member of the speakers bureau because people would say i was saying something because the society was paying me to say it kyle says he antagonized birchers by criticizing the antisemitism of some members and the fanaticism of others who he says get hooked on the organization most of them are fine people kyle believes but theyre over zealous because they look to a man as a leader and not to god but robert welch the man the birchers look to thinks of himself as part of some mighty purpose beyond our understanding by his present understanding this mighty purpose is to lead his followers in a fight against evil incarnated by people he calls communists he is a friend of the negro he says to the degree that the negro keeps out of the civil_rights movement for the civil_rights movement is part of a gigantic conspiracy to enslave mankind run by men who are utterly ruthless gangsters willing to use any means to achieve their end with sublime illogic welch says that these communists have no real dedication even to communism welch himself longs for that western europe of the nineteenth century when white men had the power and desire to bring civilized rule to the settled natives on all continents of the earth present day america according to welch is suffering from cancer and needs drastic surgery which can be provided only if birchtype americans become conspirators against established government hitler it should be remembered saw his mission as a historic revenge    entrusted to us by the creator a revenge which involved regenerating germany from the disease of democrats marxists jews masons and other criminals and hitler as time has proved also believed in drastic surgery but the american radicalright does not have a leader with hitlers outspokennessyet today welch sounds more like the klans first grand wizard n b forrest sounded when he plotted against the abolitionists in  i loved the old government in  i loved the old constitution yet i am opposing only the radical revolutionaries who are trying to destroy it  men who would hesitate at no crime and who have only one object in view to enrich themselves    i want you to understand distinctly i am not an enemy to the negro we want him here among us he is the only laboring class we have    
smple and tragic the storyan old one jerry chatman and one robert shuler are young negroes under sentences of death for the rape of a white woman the letter came as attorney tobias simon with florida law students were completing a statewide investigation as part of the naacp legal defense funds campaign against the discriminatory application of the death penalty against negroes in rape cases the defense fund handles virtually all of the civil_rights litigation in the country the attorneys were in a difficult position the client wanted to give up the fouryear battle for his life he simply could not take it anymore yet the attorney knew it might be proven the state had no right to execute him fortunately it was resolved when he changed his mind and the federal judge in charge of the case took this into account and ordered the defense to continue the state had argued that chatmans letter gave them the right to execute him scope of the legal defense fund program ¦ besides chatman and shuler eight other negroes are on death row in florida for the rape of white women two others have asked the legal defense fund to defend them to protect the others the fund made a plea to the governor not to execute any of them until the chatman and shuler cases concerning the states right to execute are settled the governor agreed to withhold execution pending disposal of the issue the fund also represents twelve other negroes under death sentence for rape in six other southern states others may also be under death sentences who dont know help is available importance of the statistics the extraordinary thing about the chatman and shuler cases is that florida is the first and only state in the nation for which defense attorneys have gathered statistics that blanket an entire state and compare the conviction and death penalties for negro and white defendants records in each of  counties had to be examined in addition to the records of three state agencies  a complete factual picture is crucial for the supreme court of florida seven years ago turned down two defendants because the data they offered to prove discrimination was incomplete these defendants had presented the total number of executions but not the total number of convictions both were executed florida death penalty rate over the last  years  men have been sentenced to death for forcible rape six were white and  were negroes this is against a background of an almost equal number of convictions between the two races  white men convicted and  negro men convicted of the six whites sentenced to death the supreme court of florida reversed the sentences of two and the pardon board the last hope of the defendant commuted the death sentences to life for three of the remaining four therefore only one white man has actually been executed for the crime of rape and this defendant raped an  yearold white child and was about to commit sodomy on a young  yearold boy who was also present this defendant joined an allstar cast of twosince only one other white man had been executed before  of the  negroes sentenced to death  have already been executed and  are now on death row six others had their death sentences reversed four by the supreme court of florida and two by the supreme court of the united states out of  appeals by negro defendants the pardon board has granted mercy in only two cases the board evidently considers rape by a negro more serious than murder for it has granted commutations for  per cent of the murderers sentenced to death who appealed to them who were the victims no white man has been sentenced to death for raping a negro woman although  were convicted of the crime of the six whites originally sentenced to death four attacked white children and two jointly raped a white adult but the only one executed raped an yearold white child no white man has died for the rape of a white woman the rape of a negro woman is not considered serious even when the rapist is a negro for the rape of  negro females by negro males only three men were sentenced to death and two of these were child rapes the conviction of the third was reversed by the florida supreme court thus to date no negro has died for the rape either of a negro adult or a negro child the picture shifts sharply as regards rapes of white females by negro men in  convictions  defendants or roughly  per cent of those convicted have been sentenced to death only one of the  involved a white child all the others involved white women the  negroes executed were drawn from this group of  defendants what will be argued in court the struggle with florida which may end in the supreme court of the united states could save  negro defendants and ultimately white defendants if successful the fund will argue that the rape statute has been used solely to execute negroes while sparing whites charged with the same crime thus denying the equal protection of the laws that is guaranteed by the federal constitution it will also be argued that killing the defendant when he has not killed anyone is cruel and unusual punishment also barred by the federal constitution both arguments could if accepted protect the white defendant from death as well to take a whites life where he has not taken a life would likewise be unlawful cruelty further the state would naturally not be able to execute a white if the penalty could no longer be applied to negroes rape international and national the united states is only one of the five out of  nations in the world that still demands capital punishment for a rape where no one was killed within the u s only  southern or border states carried the penalty and two delaware  west virginia  have dropped it since   negroes and  whites have been executed surprisingly the federal government primarily for the military and the district of columbia still maintain the death penalty for rape fiftythree men race unknown and three negroes and two whites have been executed under federal law can a negro receive a fair trial the injustice of the death penalty is acute for widespread racial prejudice makes a fair trial unlikely juries are generally all white and may have been rigged that way judges are elected by the local community and white lawyers dont like handling unpopular negro defendants in the face of such massive hostility many negroes lack hope and feel powerless when confronted with official intimidation one negro family in folkston georgia came to the legal defense fund only two days before a relative was to be executed for rape fortunately he was saved by attorneys moving rapidly but the case is not atypical group punishment when a negro is tried for attacking a white person his whole racial group is really on trial it is his group who the authorities feel must be warned against like attacks by the swift harsh treatment applied to him naturally when one  group tries another it becomes less important to have the actual perpetrator of the crime any representative from the minority group will do the laws of the south are quite concerned with prohibiting interracial sex states make voluntary sexual contacts or even marriage between negroes and whites a crime rape by a negro is the deepest cut of all the crime triggers hysteria and latent sexual fears and the personal route for thinking about the crime is there what if it had been my wife or my child delaware and west virginia are the only southern states that have abolished the death penalty for rape in the last thirty years because it has been a weapon used liberally against negroes five southern states alone have executed  negroes for rape but not one white man since rape is the end horror official excesses aimed at getting the accused are tolerated the famous groveland florida case arising in the same county where chatman was convicted is an example there four young men were accused of raping a white woman one was killed by an armed posse which claimed he resisted arrest the other three were convicted in a community where the ku klux klan ravaged negro neighborhoods in revenge for the crime two of the defendantswalter irvin and samuel shepherdreceived death and the third charles greenlee a sixteen year old was sentenced to life imprisonment shepherd and irvin won new trials from the supreme court of the united states because the jury had been selected in a racially discriminatory manner sheriff willis mccall on bringing the two defendants back to the county for retrial shot both of hem he said they were trying to escape shepherd died instantly but miraculously irvin lived on his hospital bed and near death irvin said they had not tried to escape but that mccall had stopped the car mumbled something about niggers giving him a hard time and shot them at the time they were handcuffed to one another wrist and ankle irvin was tried and sentenced to death for a second time but later became one of the only two negroes in floridas history to have his sentence commuted the shuler and chatman convictions are being challenged on the grounds that falsified and suppressed evidence was used a statement by the victim to the prosecutor that shuler had not touched her was never divulged to the court two former county deputies supported by fbi agents are now willing to testify that two of the deputies faked the footprints that were supposed to have come from the victims yard the two deputies claim a right against selfincrimination under the florida constitution and have refused to testify possibility of error the chatman and shuler cases show that the innocent may be falsely convicted but apart from official obstruction of justice motivated by racial prejudice there are two other possibilities of error florida unlike many other states does not require that the womans claim of rape be supported by other testimony showing that it actually occurred this leaves a defendant negro or white greatly at the mercy of an unbalanced a mistaken or even a revengeful woman a negro may be afraid to tell about a secret affair with the accusing woman since southern juries may find that very notion more repulsive than an attack further doesnt the crime of rape itself particularly that of a child raise serious doubts about the sanity of a defendant in the face of the implacable and deadly hostility of the white community a negro who still attacks a white may very well be acting out of uncontrollable compulsion or derangement indeed it may be an attempt at suicide no state permits the insane to be executed yet the high rate of negro execution would indicate that whether the defendants were mentally disturbed has not been given sufficient attention where does it end the picture is a shocking and grizzly one southern regions which have kept negroes out of lowly hamburger stands have allowed them full and preferential access to the electric chair open and uncontrolled lynching has steadily fallen into disreputebut what can it matter if a racially bigoted community can use the judicial system to commit murder as surely as the mobs of yesteryear is not the whole of american justice menaced if onethird of our nation is permitted to continue with absolute racial carnage how many more jerry chatmans must there be 
wdjshen i was invited to £ write this book i did  not have a favorable w i impression of ulysses s grant the school books of the days of my youth led me to associate his name with corruption and cigars intoxication and failure i know now that this picture is as accurate as the impression of the blind man who grasped an elephants tail and thought he was holding a rope the uses of history are varied but most important is the understanding of the present in terms of its being the product of the past history is primarily a human product in two senses men live it and men write it i have tried my best to give an honest picture of the man who led the victorious armies in the last year of the civil war and then became the president during whose administration we lost the peace if my picture differs somewhat from that which school histories have led you to expect it is possible that the men who wrote them were giving expression to their prejudices or accepting too  uncritically the product of the prejudices of others to the extent that i have helped the reader to learn a great deal about a man and something about an era that have been dealt with unjustly by historians it may be that i have helped to meet some of the problems of today and tomorrow there can hardly be a time more important than the present for directing attention to the affirmative aspects of grants life and character as a son as a husband and as a father he was guided throughout his life by a morality that transcended a mere desire to please this same quality enabled him to show what his new england abolitionist contemporary thomas wentworth higginson called the moral insight to see that the mexican war was a contest in which his own country was wrong and to have the courage to say so this aspect of his character will also explain grants understanding of the difference between a peoples war and a mere contest of soldiers as colonel higginson wrote with the special insight into that difference that he himself gained in his leadership of an exslave regiment fighting for their peoples freedom grants dedication to a peoples government is shown by this citizensoldiers recognition of the subordination of the military to civilian rule so long as i hold a commission in the army i have no views of my own to carry out we are not often told of these  aspects of grants military career nor are we told in learning of his political failures of the genuine aspirations for fair play and reconciliation that moved this man before and during his presidency let us have peace was his campaign slogan and his epitaph but he wantedand fought as well as he could forjustice as the only possible foundation for a peace that would be durable one skilled contemporary observer put it prophetically as we are now learning    any postponement of justice is a postponement of peace these were the words of georges clemenceau a young political exile in  who was reporting american reconstruction for le temps and who was to lead his own country half a century later in a war that brought no peace freedom is never wholly attained but always must be pursued so it is with justice and so too with the truth about our history if you learn from the life of the soldier who was a pacifist the failure who was a success the man of action whose last victory was as a man of letters that there is more much more to americas heritage than you thought  i will have achieved my purpose in the book it is time that justice were done to the man vilified beyond his deserts by those embittered not by the mistakes he made but by his supreme achievement the ratification of the fifteenth amendment to our constitution it was that guaranty of the right of all men to vote however humble their origin that he called for in his inaugural message as an instrument of peace he hailed it when ratification was completed in words that have not been remembered from  until

american literature has been in the throes of decolonization since america first put pen to paper this literature began as a countrycousin literature of england we were beholden to england for culture and broke with that culture through politics for the great literature of this country until lately is political in fact it is the great political documents of america which have broken the back of cultural slavery all over the world the writings of jefferson the constitution the emancipation proclamation are the basic artifacts of american literature decolonization is born in these documents we are just beginning to feel 
the consequences we are still at the dawn of those fabulous political words three hundred years passed before the first words of cultural independence were set down three centuries of holding on to the old world the european mother we might have been a french country or a spanish country or english like canada but we turned out to be none of those one of the main reasons was that we had slaves we had negroes the presence of slaves forced the ideal of liberty to its conclusion when america decolonized itself from europe from england it opened the door to decolonization everywhere we pressed a button and opened the pandora box it is this country that gave france the example of revolution and even today we are the admiration and the horror of the old world we have not broken with those documents we were englands robert frost said we were colonials when we stopped being colonials all hell broke loose to be colonial means to live in a faraway place and to long for home american literature was this way until little more than a century agountil a few writers began to say like emerson europe is not home until thoreau pulled back even from the village of concord until whitman rewrote the constitution in poetry and sang the one great poe lincolnto be colonial means to hold onto the umbilicus of home and also to create the native america created two natives the indian and the negro the indian was banished to the unconscious mind of america what is left of the indian is a record of cultural shock which is phenomenal in modern history but the negro could not be banished he was an industrial army fuel to be burned and to be replenished of itself he was the american native richard wright called his first novel native son he understood native but we were still colonial when we began to write we would even send a negro slave girl to england as a poet in the eighteenth century i want to quote verbatim the biographical note from an old anthology of negro poetry edited by langston hughes and arna bontemps in  this is colonialism in a nutshell phillis wheatley senegal west africa  was captured and sold into slavery in early childhood and brought to boston in  she became the property of john wheatley of boston whose wife and daughter soon noted the alert sensitivity of the young african girl and encouraged philliss efforts to acquire learning within a few years she was completely at home in the language and literature of her captors she began writing poetry and in  at the age of seventeen published a poem by phillis a negro girl in boston on the death of the reverend george whitefield when her health began to fail phillis was advised by doctors to take a sea voyage this was arranged by the kindly mistress who also gave the girl her freedom before she sailed for england in london phillis was a success it was there that her only collected volume of verse was first issued under the title poems on various subjects religious and moral  then one by one the patrons of this talented exslave girl died and she returned to boston her marriage was unhappy and she died as a servant in a cheap lodging house at the age of thirtyone the ironies of this footnote are staggering and would require a dostoevsky to handle them phillis wheatleys poetry is as bad as all colonial eighteenth century poetry though better than that say of the hartford wits which isnt saying much yet this experiment in colonial culture contains a message the message is negative all down the line slavegirl boston at the dawn of revolution guilt about rebellion from the old world neoclassical poetry the kindly mistress and so on in every case except ours a new culture is based on home country settler and native but in america nobody knows where the home country is for the settlers come from home countries all over the world and the natives are no more we have no natives and no common home country we have no peasantry we have only expatriates and exslaves this is a country of runaways and captives when the literature of america got under way it fascinated the world runaways and captives cops and robbers cowboys and indians palefaces and blackskins jews and goyim syndicate and chamber of commerce nobody wanted to be a nativethe natives were dead and done foreverybody wanted to be a settler those who would not settle went back to some old country of the mind eliot santayana pound hemingway henry james others mourned their rootlessnesswe have a whole literature of that the cultural history of our country is one of decolonization every element trying to sever itself from its origins we are something like the white australians who are not eager to trace their ancestry back more than three or four generations because that original ancestor will have been sent over in the hulks the convict ships which were sent from england to the farthest place england could think of every ffv in australia was a convict we are in the same boat we have only a paper aristocracy and our aristocrats were revolutionaries who fought for their lives in this sense the daughters of the american revolution are subversives only they have forgotten what their ancestors were subversive about our literature took a long time to decolonize from english literature and the process hasnt ended yet in the beginning we were anglosaxon about  percent for the blacks were not counted in the population and the immigrants hadnt arrived excuse a few statements of facts which i think mean so much a generation after independence the germans and irish began to arrive in force before the civil war hordes of irish dutch danes swedes norwegians swiss and jews swarmed in toward the end of the century came larger waves of italians russians poles austrians bohemians and hungarians a smaller number of asiatics seeped in for this country is still antiasiatic we invented our first concentration camps of american citizens of japanese ancestry during the second world war in all this the english element was inundated and contaminated the language of the king was lost in the shuffle a language in itself is nothing a literature in itself is nothing a literature is the expression of a nations soul and a great literature leaves nothing outthat is its greatness but to leave nothing out means to go against the grain it means to dissent our modern literature is a literature of dissent monotonous and endless dissidence this dissidence gives modern literature its authenticity yet this literature of dissent is only in its infancy dissent is contagious and every day we find new areas of eruption everywhere in the world but dissent is also a drop in the bucket of literature a drop of pigment in the skin or in the blood american literature is unique it is the only literature i have ever heard about in which all elements have tried more or less simultaneously to decolonize themselves it is the only literature which practices cultural amnesia as a doctrine the two famous american writers henry james and t s eliot who refused to surrender the past who insisted on memory surrendered their nationality to the idea of european cultural supremacy they could maintain a continuity with europe only by becoming european again english literature is a dead literature in america a memory the english language is practically a memory only a few english professors in this country pretend that english and its great literature are continuous with ours a decolonized literature in an african country or in a free arab country or in israel is different from ours those nations have a culture to go back to they go back to where they began when history interrupted their life in israel the hebrew language was reinvented overnight after a sleep of two thousand years it seemed the most natural thing in the world for it was that language and its great book which held those people together who became the new israelites in india people fight in the streets to retain their ancient tongues the source of their culture in africa french and english will not long remain the medium of literature not in the european forms at least but in america we have only vestiges of culture to which we do not wish to return the first thing the american immigrant tried to do was to prevent his children from inheriting the old language the old culture in my case for instance yiddish was used as a private language of jokes and confidences which we third generation americans were not supposed to know i have found the same to be true with students of mine who are of czech descent or swedish or dutch or greek in a sense all cultural languages are banished from america a country settled by runaways and slaves did not carry much high culture with it and the tides of immigration engulfed what high culture there was the halfeducated american has long been a byword abroad in fact it is impossible for the american to be educated in the european sense we cannot be nor do we have to as  ask my fellow teachers in what way am i to present say english poetry to the grandson of a latvian farmer from a ranch in western nebraska as the poetry of his culture in what way am i to present chaucer or t s eliot to my negro students is that their heritage is the great complex of european culture their heritage and do they have any such heritage at all even to me an english projessor and a writer of the english tongue all things english are foreign i gather from sartres recent writing about africa that european culture is no longer capable of influencing world culture europe is now the colony it is european culture which is thirsty for replenishment from outside american culture shows a similar thirst for replenishment but can slake this thirst from within the great theme of american literature is rootlessness and this fact also makes us unique many writers have even said that there is no relationship between the american and the land it is as if the spirit of place were hostile to us we become the greatest technicians and mechanics because we fight the spirit of place we are bent upon conquering place by force we have never made peace with the land but have taken it by storm d h lawrence felt about this as miller and faulkner have in their books the urban poets who have forgotten what a tree looks like substantiate it in their dusty poems the price our writers have had to pay for rootlessness for cutting ties with all the different pasts behind us is the neuroticism we know so well in our literature and yet we have no choice insofar as the american writer is true to his situation he is a neurotic ridden with the anxieties of separateness from the past freedom is one of the beneficent symptoms of this anxiety we are suddenly confronted with an alphabet of freedom ranging from civil_rights to freedom of the banned book and the spoken obscenity our literature is engaging in a socratic dialogue with all previous values we do this with increasing recklessness and frequently with cynicism for what is there to lose the fact is that there is no place to go back to we have nowhere to go but forward we cannot help ourselves that is our condition so long as america held onto the mother literature it was colonial this was the case until the twentieth century and even into it the criterion of the poem was the english poem of the novel the english novel the exceptions are few and can be counted on one hand it was only with the recognition of rootlessnes that a strong and massive american literature came into being this theme coincided with all the forms of radicalism which swept through the intelligentsia in the early years of the century anarchism various forms of marxism and more recently existentialism are all expressions of the rootless those peoples set adrift by history who have nevertheless become articulate the jewish writer was among the first to speak from this void the jew is the mythic wanderer but the american jew is the one who has forgotten where he wandered from the american jew has no longing for israel and possibly only an intellectual sympathy with it he has little or no cultural memory of the religion or of the tradition all he has is the invisible yellow badge which still shows up in certain lights this badge this psychology of selfconsciousness make the jew want to be absolutely visible he insists on his identification he is the opposite of ellisons invisible man if the jew does not stick out like a sore thumb he is very restless hence all these books by and about jews why does the irishman james joyce choose a poor uninteresting jew to be his main character in ulysses because leopold bloom not only has a faulty memory of his fabulous past as a hebrew but because he is lost bloom is a symbol of the modern bourgeois drifter he doesnt belong in ireland or anywhere else he is cultural ectoplasm in america we are all cultural ectoplasm and the jew can stick out his sore thumb look in a mirror and say like job whence cometh thou i dont want to give one more book review of the now famous and brilliant novel herzog but  cant resist a sentence or two herzog the neurotic professor and intellectual is having a breakdown ostensibly because of a broken marriage but the marriage is secondary he is having a breakdown because he is herzog american jewish intellectual like leopold bloom he is discovering that he is adrift he has no place to go back to neither his home from which he has been locked out by his bitchy wife nor his world of ideas which has fallen all over the floor of his study and all he can do is write letters to the living and the dead trying to make a contact somewhere with all those broken wires it is almost a formula of the american novel what is the fascination for the jewish american writer today it is the fascination of the american for one of his own types the man who at last debates with himself the question what does it mean to be a jew an american a negro an american jew an american negro an afroamerican an american of jewish descent etc what it means of course is that the question has been raised the question was not raised in the nineteenth century except perhaps by walt whitman and the question refers art back to the political artifacts are those things real do they mean what i think and hope they mean the constitution of the united states has been backed into a corner by writers no constitution can answer all the questions we are asking it every time the constitution answers a question it asks a new one but americanjewish writing is already obsolete the jew qua jew is no longer a major premise in the creative equation the jewish writer can in effect sit back and chew his cud and watch the negro the jew has achieved decolonization in america not by himself it was going to happen somehow i lived through it and even had a hand in itmaybe i should explain that very early in life i decided upon being a poet i wont go into the motivations of being a poet which are very complex and also irrelevant here  knew only one language english and so fell in love with english poetry falling in love with english poetry which is still my old flame meant living an imaginary english life living an imaginary english life meant living a phony life of the mind for i was not english in any sense of the word and living a phony life of the mind meant eventually becoming an english professor i have no rights to the title one day when  had learned how to write poetry i had to make a decision about my name nobody in the oxford book of english verse was named shapiro in fact nobody was named shapiro except tailors and junk dealers what was  to do change my name this was my first crisis as a poet in those days believe it or not it was impossible to get a poem published if you did not have an anglosaxon name but  decided to stick to my name that decision made me jewish and since i had made the decision i wrote poems about jewishness my name itself had not content whatever most jews names are more recent than the last names of negroes that is most jews got names when napoleon broke the ghetto system in europe and the jews were either given the names of a german or polish town or made up one shapiro is named after a german town named speyer  am told i hold on to vanderbilt or r j reynolds it was the foreignness of the word i hung onto that i wanted to know why my name was a kind of curse years later  published a book called poems of a jew that was when i was finally decolonized when i printed that book i was already american  was as rootless as a texas millionaire with negro and indian blood in his veins when our literature got under way it began like a census to list our cultural deaths there was the grand gesture of whitman like a captain on the bridge waving goodbye to the past there was captain ahab hunting down the great white blood consciousness and sinking the ship of white civilization along with it there was huck finn who lit out for the wilderness running for his life like his author from respectability there followed that long recital of the failure of the american hero the epitaphs of spoon river and winesburg ohio the brutal caricatures of the american bourgeois the salesman the evangelist the politician the corruption of pioneer and settler by the rootless materialism of the new world hemingway assaults the virility of the american male faulkners vast gallery of southerners portrays the decline and fall of a world under a cursehe calls it rightly the curse of slavery of the heroes of the american novel only the artist is left unscathed he is ishmael in the cultural desert it is the motif of rootlessness that gives our literature its greatness to the outside world whatever the value of literary prizes consider the names of americans who have been awarded the nobel prize for literature eugene oneill pearl buck hemingway faulkner and steinbeck eliot i take it is not american these writers deal mainly with modern man in the void if they are part of what is called the western tradition they lie at the very edge of it each phase of american literature marks a further step away from that tradition as each colonial group in america finds its literary voice we are moved deeper into the void huckleberry finn ahab joe christmas herzog it hardly matters who the hero is he leads us on the search for his authenticity it is the unauthentic american artist who reaches back to the tradition the martinique writer and psychiatrist frantz fanon who died four years ago says in his book the wretched of the earth that when the african native begins to pull on his moorings and to cause anxiety to the settler he is handed over to wellmeaning souls who in cultural congresses point out to him the specificity and wealth of western values and he adds but every time western values are mentioned they produce in the native a sort of stiffening or muscular lockjaw the cultural conference or congress is a twentieth century institution which has never been looked at squarely i myself make it a point to avoid those conferences but i have attended enough of them here and abroad to know that they represent a more or less official machine dedicated to the status quo they seek to hold the line for traditional values for this reason the culture conference is supported by governments by foundations and by writers and artists who have a stake in the tradition the culture conference is opposed to decolonization at least the decolonization of culture the hidden premise on which it operates is the superiority of european culture it must therefore work hard to reconvert the native and bring him back to a sense of cultural inferiority i attended once one of these conferences in tokyo where it was agreed beforehand that politics could not be discussed here were a multitude of writers from all the world among them some of the most famous and some of the most political who voluntarily emasculated all discussion at the outset instead they talked about the art of translation and  had a similar experience last summer a group called the congress for cultural freedom was to meet in west berlin to honor poets from the new african nations i was invited to speak on the first day along with a negro poet whose language was french and a negro poet whose language was english that is they were colonials in the throes of decolonization evidently the berlin meetings were to restore the faith of the africans in european culture but why was i asked to open the meetings along with the african poets because i was an american jew supposedly assimilated into the american or as the conference perhaps thought western tradition  intended to go having never been to germany or having met poets of africa immediately upon my acceptance however i received a letter from a french writer in charge of the affair who began to caution me what to say and what not to say that struck me as a bit odd coming from an official of an organization that used the word freedom in its name nor would he be specific in one letter he would flatter me by saying that he knew i was a great fighter or words to that effect and in the next he would indicate that the meetings must be kept friendly i was never more puzzled in my life nor more offended our correspondence went on all summer ending in a flurry of cablegrams in which i finally declined to come to berlin if  were to be gagged and what was it the congress of cultural freedom which was entertaining poets from the new africa refused to have discussed the race question had i been a believer in the tradition and its values i might have served the congress well  might have told how a jewish poet born in america made a rapproachement with the tradition but i have never made such a rapproachement they had invited the wrong man as tennyson said about the charge of the light brigade someone had blundered is negro literature possible a few years ago one could ask in all seriousness is a negro literature possible in america the question implied a negative i am among those who felt that the negro had nothing to gain by becoming literary that he had nothing to say according to the tradition of letters as we know that tradition he could only create a pseudoliterature the novel and poem according to uncle tom we had seen this happen with paul laurence dunbar and the early slave poets between a transliterated negro dialect itself a phony dialect and oxjord book english there seemed no choice if there were to be an authentic negro medium where would it come from obviously it could not come from the standard classics of american literature poetry or prose perhaps something could rise from the church spiritual a form of poetry which worked upon secret levels of meaning or more likely from the blues but almost nothing of the sort appeared to be happening a literature is not created in a vacuum it is created out of love for its medium could and should the negro love the angloamerican language or was it possible that he had his own version of it as the jewish writer had his version but a literature is more than a version of language a novel or poem is more than a work of art literature is an accurate transcription of the quality of thought and feeling of the writer and his people what audience would such a literature have if any was there a negro audience to read native son or invisible man or tolsons libretto one suspected there wasnt that such works would be for a small white or mixed audience the publication of native son was a great shock to the white reader not only because of what it said but because a negro had written it negroes didnt produce works of that calibre nor did they read them literature so the mythos went wus white mans business even the books by richard wright were in the white tradition his audience was the traditional audience as were the values implicit in the work ellisons invisible man which i wrote about elsewhere as the great american novel is a masterpiece but again in the white tradition ellison might even be called a white negro neither what he says or how he says it is without precedent in the general literary consciousness like wright he corroborates the white liberals worst fears like wright he illuminates the guilt of the settler visavis a native in fact it seems to me that there is more negritude if i may use the word in faulkner than in either wright or ellison faulkner is better able to present the sensibility of the negro albeit the mississippi negro because faulkners characters are not always at the point of dramatic crisis what wright and ellison proved was that the negro can write a novel as good as a white novel as good as anything in the tradition but this obviously was not enough especially as the tradition was beginning to come apart at the seams for a negro literature to come into being it had to start from the bottom not from the top all great poetry comes from the bottom homer dante chaucer whitman all went to the language of the street for their great poems a negro poetess could prove that she could win the pulitzer prize but nobody has been able to prove that the pulitzer prize is worth winning embracing the art of writing at some time in its career a people makes a decision to embrace the art of writing it has no obligation to at any time the jews produced virtually no literature after the old testament except commentaries the jews were in a state of cultural withdrawal all during the diaspora scholars will disagree but cannot convince me that the jews produced any literature or art or music worth mentioning until the great revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries freed the jew from cultural bondagelt is in our century that the jew has suddenly begun to sing and paint and write for this is the century of cultural liberation all over the world ours is one of the greatest periods of art in history and it is great insofar as we have broken with the tradition to break with the tradition does not mean to annihilate it it means to place new values upon it it means to pick up the pieces and maybe throw them down again malraux means this when he says about the greatness of modern art the fragment is king negro literature in america had to begin with the fragment not with the whole form having proved out of pride that it could handle the w hole form like wright or ellison or gwendolyn brooks or langston hughes it must then throw down the formsfrom the top of the empire state building i think that is what baldwin is doing critics say what a shame that baldwin should give up the novel for the polemic and the pamphlet i dont think that is any of our business what if the novel has proved unsatisfactory to him what if the poem has proved the same arent all the great examples of art and literature of our time antiart the greatness as well as the horror of the twentieth century is that it is a last judgment it is a time when every value is called into question everywhere and on every level of the human experience it is the genius of our age to question the racial revolutions of our age are more effects than causes they are the result of universal indignation over the failures of our culture one country famed for its music and its philosophers tried to destroy a whole nation in its midst by murder another country famed for poetry discovered that it held a large part of the world in virtual slavery another country famed for its sense of liberty and its adoration of the arts suddenly collapsed from internal weakness and corruption these were all european countries of great antiquity in the east rose a superpolice state with a paranoid belief in its historical destiny in america we assembled and exploded the ultimate weapon the generation that inherited these acts of the immediate past was catatonic people referred to them as the silent generation and they were ten years ago i went to the campus at berkeley california to teach one of the professors in my department cautioned me that it was hard to do any work there it was a lotus land and so it was not only the faculty but the students were somnambulists then a young man across the bay in san francisco published a poem which was heard round the world it was scream of anguish it was obscene and american and innocent aggressive and angry it was the first shot in the new revolution of the word and it was a signal for a general awakening of the consciousness of a new generation a generation got out of its convertibles and went on the picket line i dont think this an exaggeration about allen ginsbergs howl it was a poem that flatly refused to accept the premises about decorumliterary political racial cultural it was a poem of refusal and of absolute commitment a san francisco earthquake in the rhythm of leaves of grass the defenders of the tradition the cemeterykeepers hurried to defend their cemeteries they brought up their heavy artillery but it didnt matter almost simultaneously the civil_rights movement appeared on the horizon the two things are related one forbidden book after another some of the great classics of our age passed through the courts victoriously and so forth and so on up to the present free speech movement which is shaking educational institutions to their foundations for many years i have been trying to loosen the hold of the academic or colonial mind over poetry not only poetry but the entire literature of reference the kind that refers back in every case to prior commitments historical religious or philosophical in a sense it is a useless battle attacking the establishment only tends to strengthen it it would be better to ignore the existence of the literature of reference and to create whatever we think valid than to go on tilting at windmills this is what the beat writers did they were successful because they refused to take part in the academic dialogue if someone asked one of the usual deathly questions such as what is the role of the artist in the modern world they would be likely to answer something like fried shoes refusal to play the game kept them safe refusal to play the game won freedom for india and is winning freedom for the american south refusal to play the game will turn the dehumanized multiversity back into a place of learning the importance of the negro writer in the world today is far out of proportion to the number of books we have to go by but the significance of negro writing today is paramount because everywhere not simply in america the negro is in the position to ask the questions the hyphenated jewish writer is no more time has solved that problem the jewish writer is either assimilated into the modern bourgeois world with all its neuroses or he is a settler in the biblical land carrying on skirmishes against the philistines or the egyptians as in the days of old a few american jews try to keep alive the mystique of the diaspora but with little success most modern jews themselves reject the myth of the dispersion for our time they go to israel and have a look and then hurry back to detroit or omaha today the american negro faces the same dilemma richard wright baldwin tolson know that mother africa is not for them and the africans know it too everywhere decolonization is taking place we find the disappointment of the visitor who feels rejected from his dream but this is part of the awakening part of the process of freedom itself if the african looks down on the american negro he has earned that right if the afroamerican feels out of place in nigeria or even liberia he knows at last the limits of his dream we can witness at the moment three phases of decolonization in our culture nostalgia assimilation and negritude nostalgia is homesickness not for the good old days but for the bad old days assimilation means a cultural entente at the expense of any mystique negritude means assertion of the realities historical and mystical as well the early literature of america all of it is nostalgic for the worst it is as true of anne bradstreet as for phillis wheatley and in fact the masses of people at any time fear the heavy responsibilities of freedom and pine for the bad old days when all choices were made for them to not have to choose is a freedomthe freedom of the slave the negro poets who cultivated a slave dialect were in fact in accord with their condition they consented to the cultural authority of the whiteprosody as the white colonials acceded to the cultural authority of the old world the nostalgia of assimilation but assimilation too is nostalgic it was often said of german jews before hitler that they were more german than the germanswhich didnt stop hitler from rooting them out the nostalgia of the american jewish writer who is assimilated into american literature is curious i was talking with a famous american writer who had made jewishness the theme in his books speaking of the new jews the israelis he said but they arent jews anymore i agreed those new jews had lost their consciousness of the diaspora they had fought their way back into the mythical homeland and were lost to the old jewry but cultural assimilation of jews into american life was relatively easy and has all but been accomplished a jew has not the problem of the hindu the oriental or the negro the jew looks more or less american anywhere he goes even his name is not held against him as it once was but cultural assimilation alo means national oblivion for the nation assimilated one can only pretend to act like a jew the writer and artist can do this easily because that is his business the american jew of average sensibility on the other hand experiences the common cultural amnesia of americans of any extraction while the american jewish figure in fiction has a cultural nervous breakdown over american twentieth century values he longs for the bad old days when his father was a bootlegger or a peddler because he was suffering the crucifixion of the culturally underprivileged the father would do anything to keep his family jews to turn them into doctors and lawyers or rich merchants with economic freedom they could then be jews only it didnt work that way for jewishness meant suffering and an unsuffering jew was an anomaly an unsuffering jew is a goy hence the nostalgia of the assimilated the negro is luckier he can never disappear from his condition in the caucasian world any more than a hindu or a japanese there he is unassimilable and unnostalgic the biggest fact of life in the modern world the ideal of negritude j our century is very great because with us all the chickens have come to roost because great men of goodwill statesmen presidents leaders of men artists and young people have demanded the exaction of promises made to nations by visionaries and the spokesmen of freedom this is happening under our eyes we are all a party to it nostalgia is obsolete assimilation may well be neither is of vital importance i prefer the idea of negritude at least it is the first great idea or concept that can deal with the biggest fact of modern life without trying to water it down i will give three examples aime cesaire leopold senghor and m b tolson cesaire is a caribbean senghor is a senegalese and tolson was born in missouri the first two use french for poetry tolson uses english or american my designation of tolsons language is that he writes in negro or rather all three of these great poets write in negro that is what negritude means in literature it does not mean accommodation to the standards of the settler or to his nostalgia for the mother or father country it does not mean making peace through disappearance into the scene nor as senghor has shown so nobly in his political writings does it mean war it means insistence on the pride of selfhood without hatred no oppressed people in history has had less sense of revenge than the negro retribution is not negro negritude is simply decolonization under the positive aspect senghor has no grudge against the tradition as l do or against modern technology on the contrary he welcomes everything which will make possible the greater harmony among men this is the wisdom of the french in the decolonized man the daring of the french to push an idea into action as far as it will go there are i believe no african poets of the english language of his stature the english are still the heirs of apartheid cesaires discovery of negritudehe is pinned as the inventor of the nameis that of the disaffected assimilationist the parisian from the colonies who became a marxist and by nomination a surrealist even though surrealism is taboo among communists surrealism is a luxury of the white civilization a toy of people who can afford unconciousness it is also a desperate attempt to rejoin civilized brilliance with a raison detre surrealism is an adrenaline shot in the heart under superb cultural conditions it revives a culture which does not really want to live cesaire as i understand it did not rise to the bait when andre breton elected him to the surrealist school i am not criticizing surrealism which is of fundamental value in all modern arts i am pointing out the naivete of the french in enlisting colonials in esthetic causes which were far from the realities of the african or the american negro negritude in the famous poem cahier dun retour au pays natale memorandum on my martinique is one translationnegritude is the realization of pity for the modern world with its great inventions and its great alibis it shouts hurrah not for the steel blue speed of the modern but for those who have never invented anything hurrah for those who never invented anything hurrah for those who never explored anything hurrah for those who never conquered anything i know of only one american poet who in genius and experience even approaches the concept m b tolson and tolson knows that the concept is different with us in american culture according to the groundrules there can be no separatism even by race and color what then is there a long road of assimilation and miscegenation ahead can there be an american negritude tolson is an american who is also the poet laureate of liberia he lives in oklahoma in an allnegro town where he was once mayor he is sixtyfiveyears old in various capacities as editor i have published more poetry by him than anyone in america he has a superb reputation among poets and critics but is unknown to students and to the general reading public this is not because he is difficult to read which he is for difficulty of text is the stockintrade of the poetryteaching professiontolson is not read because he is a negro a blind spot in the white literary eye will not recognize a great negro poet the white professional mind thinks that poetry is written by englishmen or their descendants and imitators tate looks at tolson to complicate matters tolsons libretto for the republic of liberia commissioned by the first african republic has in its american publication an introduction by allen tate mr tate is a confederate of the old school who has no use for negroes but who will salute an exception to the race he sees tolson as an exception because for the first time    a negro poet has assimilated completely the poetic language of his time and by implication the language of the angloamerican tradition mr tate invites mr tolson to join his country club tate is one of the canniest critics in the business the american t s eliot as it were but the crux of the matter is that tate says the distinguishing negro quality is not in the language but in the subjectmatter   for subjectmatter can only deal with ones suffering and contaminate the beauty of poetry i have tried to correct this statement in my own introduction to tolsons recently published harlem gallery tate considers that the use of negro subjectmatter in poetry which he calls the tragic aggressiveness of the modern poet limits the negro poet to a provincial mediocrity i will not trouble you with my opinion of the modern classicism which mr tate represents  have written more than one book about it except to point out that this powerful critic does not consider the theme of negro suffering good enough for the art of poetry just as though the theme of america was not a good enough theme for the poet hart crane but in trying to assert that tolson has been assimilated by the angloamerican tradition he puts tolson in quarantine and destroys the value of the poempossibly this critics conscious intention thus it took a southern intellectual and poet an antinegro poet to introduce tolsons libretto that was the only possible literary context for a great negro poet ten or fifteen years ago he must in that context be captured and returned to colonization to that tradition which had enslaved his ancestors and would continue to do so if it could manage it the refusal to see that tolsons significance lies in his language negro and that only that language can express the poetic sensibility of the negro at the door of freedom is a final desperate maneuver to contain the negro within the traditional culture and for that it is too late the tradition is already antebellum the falsification i speak of is that of trying to assimilate tolson into the tradition when he was doing the opposite the fact that tolsons libretto is unknown by white traditionalists gives the lie to the critics assertion that tolson has risen above negro experience to become an artist the facts are that tolson is a dedicated revolutionist who revolutionizes modern poetry in a language of american negritude the forms of the libretto and of harlem gallery far from being traditional are the negro satire upon the poetic tradition of the eliots and tates the tradition cannot stand being satirized and lampooned and so tries to kick an authetic poet upstairs into the oblivion of acceptance but the negro artist wont stay in the attic anymore than he stayed in the cellar 
i was less than enthusiastic about spending the summer back home in gravesville alabama after my perfectly marvelous freshman year at columbia u i felt that there was a great injustice here i had friends going to south america europe and god knows where all else and there i was in  young healthy and alive with nowhere to go but gravesville maybe it was my boredom that led me to do what i did exactly when this crazy thought first entered my mind i cant really remember but i believe it started one evening in june about eight oclock i was glancing over the ladies home journal when a young woman about  years old burst into the house and announced lord somebody done stole my husband like everyone else present  thought she meant that the man had been purloined however she clarified the matter by adding that lowdown levi stole him in the left side my uncle who then immediately understood that her husband had been shot without being given a fair chance to defend himself proceeded to call a doctor as she related the tale to us and to half the neighborhood who had followed her in hungrily seeking details i stared at her she was only seven years older than i but she looked much older early marriage just ruins a woman then that neighborhood she lives in its just around the corner from us but there is a world of difference i asn sure you do you think i would be seen on the public streets in an old faded cotton dress like that and those dirty socks and rundown loafers sucre bleu charlie mae the young woman with the stolen husband was a high school graduate and typical of what kelley street colored high turned out that was my school too but i dont mind saying that i was the exception there rather than the rule i lay awake half the night that night and many nights that followed trying to decide what i could do to improve the socioeconomic status of the negroes of my hometown i ate breakfast that wednesday morning about seven oclock it was a very satisfying breakfast grandma could make pancakes that would make you love your motherinlaw i could hear the sound of leather striking human flesh and the scream mama i aint goin do it no mo  from next door about the time that an elderly woman a friend of my grandmother came in in a dress that almost reached her ankles and a scarf or rather in the vernacular a head rag tied around her head miss arlethia walked slowly and with a limp it was not a bit unusual that she should just walk in this way everybody did the door stayed open until  oclock at night when we all went to bed this is partially attributable to the fact that we owned the only telephone in the neighborhood and the entire community used it lord ha mercy this mus be the baby she acknowledged upon seeing me honey dont these chillun grow why i remember when this chile was bon the conversation continued along this vein as  finished the dishes then went out on the front porch and sat in the front porch swing  wonder what alex my sophisticated boy friend from chicago would think if he could see this place i laughed to myself at the notiona committee of unwashed juveniles approached me from the street is there any haints in that ol house on cooper street the spokesman wanted to know you mean are there any     i started  was going to give her a better sentence for the same question but i didnt know quite what to do with that word haints if i said supernatural beings i was certain she would not know what i meant there is no such thing as a haint  stated yeah it is the one in the patched shorts protested my daddy says it is are you sure your daddy said this yeah he say one night a big green haint wid long purple fingernails come out of that house and chase him all the way home ooowee the others exclaimed they jumped off the side of the porch and ran off to a game of grandma gray can i go out to play which was just as well because there was no point in arguing with a testimonial like that segregation thats what caused all this segregation leads to inferior schools inferior schools lead to inferior education and inferior education invariably leads to ignorance and poverty besides just the year before the supreme court had ruled that there was no such thing  as separate but equal why i bet these people never even heard of brown vs the topeka school board yes it was the handwriting on the wall gravesville alabama must be integrated if i could integrate gravesville it would be an example for the rest of the state alabama would then be an example for the south and i would be the liberator go down moses and tell ok pharaoh to let my people go now surely the town officials around here are not beyond reason after all they are supposed to be the most intelligent people in gravesville i went to the booker t washington branch of the library and requested that some books giving statistical data about gravesville be brought from the main library which citizens of color were not allowed to use i stayed up nights preparing information that no one could argue with showing that economically segregation was ruining the south integration was the only thing that could save us and gravesville would lead the way excitement bubbled in me during those days like hot custard on thanksgiving eve by independence day i had completed my report but i decided to save it until after the fourth i told no one they wouldnt understand besides these uncle toms didnt know what was good for them about the sixth of july i tried to get permission to see the mayor and got nowhere fast this was a great disappointment it ruined my entire plan but as my grandfather would say there are more ways to kill a cat than choking him to death on hot butter i placed the papers in a manila envelope and mailed them to the mayor who returned them within a week without so much as a comment what would moses have done if he had this sort of problem with of pharaoh i remembered that  knew mrs ruby lee gibbs who was mayor dewberrys maid  went over to try to persuade mrs gibbs to let me work in her place for one day in fact i begged desperately the speech i gave that woman would have made daniel webster sound like a prep school debator after making promises to her among them that i would let her have the money i made i talked her into it i donned the uniform which was too large and papers in hand went to work i fixed mr dewberrys breakfast and was pouring his second cup of coffee when he realized that i was not mrs gibbs wheres ruby lee he wanted to know she is ill i shall be executing her duties while she convalesces i said giving him the statement that i had prepared for the occasion oh he said and went back to his newspaper i decided to wait until he got home that evening as he evidently was not the most pleasant of men when he got up in the morning besides this would give me the time i needed to prepare the day passed quickly in the old antebellum mansion dewberry came in for dinner about five oclock he saw me pretty much as part of the furniture as i served the evening meal when i had cleaned the kitchen i came into the den and made a request i would like a few moments audience with you please i realize this was a little formal but for gods sake the white people around here already think were all semiilliterate what is it he asked really looking at me for the first time well i have some papers here    hey you going to be working here regularly honey honey now i was really set aback what did this fat middleaged halfbald white man mean about the papers he said if youre in some kind of trouble sure i can do you a favor if youre willing to do me one i didnt like the implication here at all you dirty old man i screamed and with the papers still in my hand i ran out the door and all the way to the bus stop when i got on the bus i sat in the last seat this was contrary to my purpose but hell i was tired i could start fighting segregation again in the morning as i lay in my bed that night still shaking at the thought of that tobacco stained old clayeater i considered the possibility that i was  going at this whole thing from the wrong angle this is still a democracy and the will of the people is still supreme while the population of gravesville is of course predominately white we have more than the usual percentage of negroes found in a small southern town if we demanded our rights we would be bound to be heard who knows it might be easier than one would imagine tomorrow i would go visiting after breakfast i kissed grandma on the cheek told her i had some business to take care of and hurried out the door before she could ask questions i would start with the people most affected by segregation and show them that there was something better to be had i would go to the pockets of degradation and poverty such neighborhoods are easily recognized for every woman you see will be pregnant carrying a baby or both the place i selected was called thirty row thirty row was an unpaved community of thirty cracker box houses most of the window panes had been shot out or rocked in saturday night brawls and were replaced by pieces of cardboard everything on thirty row the people included was filthy beyond description any and all vegetation had long since been trampled down by the herd of little tshirted barefoot black humanity which conducted a neverending stampede  across what might have been lawns at the first house i was greeted by a crude but friendly woman who invited me in after i introduced myself the room where she bade me have a seat seemingly served as living room dining room kitchen and at night bedroom i would not have been entirely surprised to have seen a toilet over in the corner as i talked to her she finished her breakfast of cold margarine mashed into alaga syrup and sopped with bread i wanted to create a pleasant atmosphere how is your family i asked jesse thats my husband well jessie been laid off from his job but he been doing yard work for some white folks til they takes him on agin the chillun is all right my lilest he was all stove up wid a col las week but i grez him good wid vics salve and he a whole lot better now good i smiled and wondered what the people who so painstakingly labeled the product vics vaporub would think if they knew that in certain circles it was known as vics salve tell me what do you think of the idea of your children going to school with the white children i asked lawd no they don wont our chillun goin to school wid thim of course it will take a little time for them to get used to the idea i explained no we ain spose to be goin to no school together miz rosemary green thats the lady i works for she say if the chillun start goin to school together theres gonna be mixin of the races then after a while everybody would be colored and if god had wanted us all one color he woulda made us that way the reasoning here more than slightly astounded me however i found myself incapable of producing a successful rebuttal i keeps miz greens il girl for her she went on and miz green say she trus me wid lil alabam jus like she trus husef but she jus don blieve in no mixin of the races you mustnt be persuaded by what others think i argued but alas in vain i left there and tried another house with similar results after a third try proved unsuccessful i decided maybe i was working with the wrong income bracket the next day i visited a few members of the if youll pardon the expression black bourgeoisie typical of the reactions i got was i know how you feel child but i just cant afford to start any mess with these white people my husband would lose his job and wed have the ku klux klan breathing down our necks on top of it we have three little children and we just cant afford to get involved i meditated on the whole thing for about three days it was now beginning to irritate me like a rash something had to be done why i had never conceived of such complacency and apathy i was ready now to lay my all on the altar as much as i hated to do it it looked like a civil_rights march was the only alternative i needed help not necessarily intelligent people just warm bodies to carry picket signs the next day i managed to talk some of our less intelligent high school students into helping me they didnt understand what this was all about but they loved getting something and they didnt seem to be scared of the proverbial redheaded devil i made and distributed picket signs after i finally impressed upon them that the idea was to walk up and down with the signs we began our demonstration in front of city hall we were viewed curiously by passersby for about fifteen minutes when i observed a number of police cars stopping nearby when the policemen came out and approached me i was ready to announce that we would stand our ground it was then that i noticed that it was no longer we but  the rest had fled at sight of the police cars i was arrested and taken to jail where i demanded a writ of habeas corpus after the chief asked habeas who i decided the notion was best abandoned my uncle came down and after some tall talking persuaded them to let me gohe drove me home and then raised whitehot hell just exactly what in the devil did you think you were doing i explained just exactly what in the devil i thought i was doing after a twohour lecture he told me that he had promised to be personally responsible for seeing that the incident was not repeated for the rest of the summer i had to give an account every time i left the house the month of august passed quietly i spent it reading and knitting occasionally people would come in and pump my grandmother for the details of my arrest i had the distinction of being the familys only criminal rumor has it that my greatgrandfather had a brother who was hanged for being a horse thief but i dont know i felt very relieved as i sat on the new yorkbound train and watched the world speed past in the opposite direction the summer was behind me and my sophomore year at columbia was ahead of me sophomorethat comes from two latin words sophos meaning wise and mows meaning fool well i dont know about the sophos part but  have certainly proven myself to be as big a mows as ever drew breath  looked up and there she was the great city of new york we reached the station i stepped off the train and back into my world
i remember thinking that i had never seen such a poorly child as ella mae the first time i laid eyes on her jim paul thats my man brought her in the cabin one night and said pearlie mae joe stevens fell in his well and drownded ella sue she was joes woman must have tried to get him out cause she drownded too they aint nobody over there to care for this youngun so i fetched it home i guess well have to keep it until we find somebody to raise it jim paul i said how you expect me to care for this youngun our own minnie belle aint but three weeks old i cant do for two babies neither one of em crawlin yet all jim paul said was somebodys got to do for it and were the only folk anyways close around here besides thats joe stevens youngun and joe saved my life onct im going over and do whats to be done for joe and ella sue most likely some of ella sues people will come to take the youngun in a day or so anvhow then he left well ella maecourse that wasnt her name then we give that to her laterwas just eight or nine days old and like i said i aint never seen a sicklier lookin baby jim paul said it looked to him like joe and ella sue must of drowndd sometime the night before and the youngun hadnt been fed or cleaned up since then i cleaned ella mae up and when i put her in the water she let out such a whoop i knowed right off that other than bein hungry and scared nigh to death they wasnt nothin wrong with her it was just about time for me to feed minnie belle and she let the whole world know it well to tell the truth i felt kinda queer about feeding ella mae she bein such a funny looking thing but i put minnie belle to one tittiei know it maybe aint nice to say such things but i always have been plain spokenand ella mae to the other one i never did have no shortage of milk that ella mae like i said before her folks must have died sometime the night before and she hadnt been fed since she really went to town when she finished she give me such a smile that  got all quivery inside well you can ask any woman and shell tell you it takes a plumb unnatural female not to love a youngun onct shes nursed it i knowed right then that if joes peoplerather ella sues people didnt come for her real soon she was going to be mighty hard to give up it was late when jim paul got back and even though he didnt say muchjim paul never was one for too much talki knowed he was i taking it real hard jim paul and joe had growed up together hunted  and fished together and gone to the army together neither one of em talked much about it but somehow or other joe had saved jim pauls life over in korea and jim paul wasnt the kind to forget something like that finally jim paul came to bed he told me i took joe and ella sue down the mountain to percy browns undertaking parlor he said hed try to get in touch with ella sues people if he could you know this mountain aint goin to seem right without joe on it me and him been through a whole lot together why we growed up together havin joe moren made up for me not havin a brother of my own im sure gonna miss that boy i got up to look at the babies and what i saw made me call jim paul to look too they was layin there in the cradlejim pauls greatgreatgrandaddy had made it hisself an it was plenty big enough for the both of eman they looked so pretty an peaceful laying there just like two angels they  looked standin there an lookin at em made me go warm and fluttery all over jim paul stood there lookin at em and he put his arm around me i looked up at his face and i could see tears shinin in his eves i aint never seen jim paul cry but he was mighty close to it then they was one other time i saw him close to cryin but they was different tears ill tell you about that when i come to it anyway jim paul was stand in there with his eyes all shiny and i could feel where he had his arm around me that he was all trembly i heard him say kinda to himself like joe i promise they buried joe and ella sue three days later we went i was holdin minnie belle and joe had ella mae it was real sad at the bury in ella sue an joe were so young an things was lookin so promisin for em it was sad but beautiful in a way im just an ignorant hill womani didnt have too much schoolinso i cant say in pretty words what i mean but if you could of seen jim paul standin there with ella mae in his arms and her just layin there so peaceful and safe youd know what  mean by sayin it was beautiful too well they never did find any of ella sues people and all joes kinfolk had been dead for a long time didnt nobody even know where ella came from joe went off one timehe never did say where and when he come back ella sue was with him they kept pretty much to themselves except for us an of course wed never ask about anything they didnt mention themselfs ella mae was a real comfort to us and since the good lord didnt see fit to bless us with any more younguns she was company for minnie belle you know how lonesome it can be on a mountain minnie belle an ella mae was just like twins them bein just a week or so apart they was crazy about one another right from the start i mean it why if one of em was hurt both of em ud cry time went on and we was all doin fine we aint never gonna be richthe lands hard up here on the mountainbut we aint never been hungry neither everything was fine until one day a man come to the house a city man he was wantin to take ella mae away he said something about it bein for her own good i bolted i ran out in the field where jim paul was work in and told him i said it would be like losin my own flesh and blood if anybody took ella mae away i never will forget the way jim paul looked when i told him he gritted his teeth and stood there for a while not sayin anything then he spoke aint nobody goin take ella mae nor minnie belle away from us not while  draw breath joe meant for this mountain to be home for ella mae and by god so do i besides  promised joe id look after her jim paul talked real polite to the stranger when we got back to the house but  could tell he had his stubborn up i guess the stranger could too jim paul stood there his eyes flashin and told him mister i reckon you mean well otherwise id run you off this land right now aint nobody takin ella mae nowhere this is her home if she wants to leave when she gets growed up thats her business but til then this is her home  the man looked right funny like hed swallowed something that didnt want to go down but he left it didnt seem like no time at all before they was ready to start to school and that was the other time i saw jim paul almost cry it was just last week but it seems like it was a long time ago some of the folks down in the valley got talkin and they wanted to send ella mae to school in the next county well  aint never seen jim paul that mad he turned plumb white and was tremblin like a leaf in a high wind we all got in the truck me and him and minnie belle and ella mae and drove down to the schoolhouse jim paul had throwed his rifle in the back of the truck when we started off and i dont mind tellin you  was scared i knowed if he got mad enough jim paul would use that rifle and it aint often he misses what he shoots at we pulled up in front of the school and marched up the steps down the hall and in the principals office jim paul had left the rifle in the truck so i felt some easier we stood there in front of the principal all four of us and when jim paul got to talking i was so proud of him my heart like to busted he told that principal mr jones i hear theres talk of sendin ella mae to school somewhere else well i pay my taxes regular and in this county and us mayberrys been payin taxes in this county ever since they been havin em why my daddy helped build this school and both my girls are gonna go to this school or else aint nobody gonna go well that principal he hemmed and he hawed but jim paul he wouldnt budge finally the principal he seen it wasnt no use so he told us hed talk it over with the school board and let us know we went on home and the next day a man came to the house and said it was all right ella mae and minnie bell could both come to the school they been goin ever since there come jim paul and the girls up the path now thats ella mae in the yellow dress and minnie belles got on the red one they go with jim paul every evenin and put flowers on joe and ella sues grave just as long as theres any kind of flower growin jim paul made em bury joe and ella sue up here on the mountain cause its so far to the colored buryin ground
