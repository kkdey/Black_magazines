would you want one of them to marry your daughter
james baldwin made one of the sharpest observations he has made in his short illustrious life one sunday over television when he stared long and hard at john kilpatrick southern genteel aristocrat from old virginia and stated r i matteroffactly youre not worried about me marrying your daughter youre  worried about me marrying your wifes daughter ive been marrying your daughter ever since the days of slavery in the whole body of negrowhite dialogue which has collected for over a hundred years this bugaboo about marrying mister charlies daughter is the non sequitur to end all non sequiturs indeed it would be ludicrous if white americans had not made into a subjective reality that was historically an objective irrelevance the fact of the matter is the american negro is the most multicolored people on this planet and not because old black joe married missy ann or because uncle tom raped little eva so let us try to put some of these myths to rest once and for all during slavery old massa kept his white wife on a pedestal by throwing aunt jemima down on the big house bed or the trips he took down to the cabins to rape aunt hagars defenseless younguns so that while old missus was withering on the vine like a raisin in the sun the kindly master was likely to be sowing black oats and making heaps of yaller chilluns along with his son and heir and those who worked for him and thats how the american black race became so many colors from coalebony all the way across the spectrum to blond and pinkish white frances anne kimbel a famous english actress who married a slaveholding georgia plantation owner describes in a letter to a friend a conversation she had had with sophy a slave it was not an unusual conversation within the context of the southern slavery system but it serves to demonstrate this aspect of that peculiar institution sophy went on to say that isaac was her son by driver morris white who had forced her while she was in her miserable exile at five pound almost beyond my patience with this string of detestable details i exclaimedfoolishly enough heavens knows ah but dont you knowdid nobody ever tell you that it is a sin to live with men who are not your husbands alas elizabeth what could the poor creature answer but what she did seizing me at the same time vehemently by the wrist oh yes missis we knowwe know all about dat well enough but we do anything to get our poor flesh some rest from the whip when he made me follow him into the bush what use me tell him now he has the strength to make me or lend your ears to mary boykin chestnut a great white southern lady speaking of slavery as she knew it god forgive us but ours is a monstrous system a wrong and an iniquity like the patriarchs of old our men live all in one house with their wives and their concubines and the mulattoes one sees in every family partly resemble the white children any lady is ready to tell you who is the father of all mulatto children in everybodys household but her own those she seems to think drop from the clouds  the mother of my maternal grandfather was thirteen years old when my grandfather was born notwithstanding the fact that he was born more than a decade after slavery kindly masters had apparently not given up their slaverytime prerogatives young master old masters favorite son raped my greatgrandmother when she was twelve and he was a gay blade of twentyone needless to say the young cutup did not make an honest woman out of my greatgrandmother that is not the way things were done in those days evolving out of this mongrelization of a proud and pure race there grew a people who came to be designated as negroes mulattoes quadroons or octoroons the dictionary is very helpful and enlightening on this subject accordingly an octoroon is a person having oneeighth negro blood the offspring of a quadroon and a white do i hear you ask but what in the devil is a quadroon a quadroon is a person who is onefourth negro the offspring of a mulatto and a white and a mulatto is the offspring of parents of whom one is white and the other a negro now let us find out what a negro is a negro is a person having more or less negro blood so you see after all the rigmarole an octoroon is a negro a quadroon is a negro a mulatto is a negro a negro is a negro is a negro is a negro any questions in many southern states one drop of black blood in your white veins makes you an american negro we black folk are indeed a powerful race of people i mean we really left our imprint on the nation and now it must be stated that although old massa or young massa for that matter never married the young black saplingofalass whom he had got in a family way he very often gave preferential treatment to her and his progeny his and hers were often allowed to play with the masters legitimate children the young bucks wore young massas handmedowns and sometimes the young heifers inherited the young missys last years prettythings they were allowed to clean old massas boots and sometimes lick them in the bargain thus was an aristocracy of color established which in many instances still persists the more you resembled the folks in the big house the better off you were you were a house nigger and you came to be contemptuous of field niggers the toilers and the sweaters who were mostly pure and black just like theyd come from mother africa but you were also contemptuous of yourself because you hated that part of you that wasnt like the master race and deep down inside you thought of yourself and others like you as bastards even though you were the bastards of the privileged you looked at yourself through the eyes of the big house people who thought of you as bastards notwithstanding with your white blood you were better off than the pure blacks working the fields of cotton thus literary myths were also created even by such formidable and wellmeaning stalwarts as harriet beecher stowe the myth that only mulatto niggers were sassy and militant and hard to control because of their white blood which naturally responded negatively to enslavement and pure blacks were meek and docile and childlike and hardworking though they were lazy and had to be driven or so the scripts of the black myths read always written by white writers but what they failed to explain was the pure blacks of the harriet tubman and nat turner ilk and all those other black rebellious souls great harriet tubman little black woman moses of her people who escaped slavery via the underground railroad but was not satisfied with her own freedom she couldnt sit still till the south was free she went back south deep down into egypt land nineteen times with a price on her head dead or alive and she led more than three hundred slaves to freedom a rifle always at her side she was the greatest underground conductor of them all her boast my train never ran off the track and i never lost a passenger and old nat turner black and strong and mighty in his righteous anger insurrectionist whose religion was freedom a religious fanatic in the great tradition of toussaint louverture and gabriel prosser denmark vesey or old john brown of bloody kansas neither could this script of myths explain those black folk who staged slowdowns all over the old plantation south when they broke the hoes and plows and other farming implements accidentallyonpurpose but the hegemony of color was established and persisted it was established by the establishment and for the blessed establishment it was a part of the great brainwash every negro was taught that the closer you were to white the better off you were in the eyes of the man the white man that is and the white mans eyes were the ones that mattered it was in him the power resided he spread the table where there were highclass crumbs for the gitting so the octoroon looked down upon the quadroon who looked down upon the mulatto and all looked down upon the low man on the totem pole who was hopelessly and helplessly black and had no one to look down upon so good hair and bad hair and high yaller became a part of the language desperate negro mothers massaged the noses of black babies trying to mold them into thinner and narrower shapes the endless futule admonitions dont poke out your mouth itll make you grow to have big ugly lips dont drink coffee itll make you black the myths of abnegation black folks study evil a black gal sleeps with her fists balled up i grew up in this kind of culture steeped in selfhatred and yet somehow our selfhatred was not as deepseated as might be imagined somehow despite the great brainwash we loved ourselves and loved each other i remember madame walkers hair straightener and i recall the aroma of burned hair and vaseline even now my mind makes pictures of tired hands and straightening combs and bleaching creams and for us boys the pomades the slickums with which we plastered our poor heads the stocking cap in which we slept all night long then up south in new york and other up south cities the process discovered to straighten black mens hair and so the conk came into vogue though it did not catch every black mans fancy it was probably at that time that many black men began to see the ridiculous lengths to which we had extended ourselves in order to resemble the master race yes old massa really started something but at this point in time and space we are ringing down the curtain sure there were negro churches in the south even in my time where a man with a black face had better not set foot unless he was the janitor there were negro colleges which had quotas for those with very dark complexions and in places like charleston south carolina or washington d c some of us were antinegro and colorconscious to a degree that bordered on sickness but we are ringing down the curtain notwithstanding the formidable debrainwashing job before us we black folk are ringing down the curtain in the west indies even to this day old massa oftentimes had thirty and forty mulatto children borne by ten or twelve black women in many of these cases though mister charlie hardly ever married any of them he oftentimes had at least one of them living with him in the big house and others stashed out vying for his favor the offspring of such situations more often than not rejected their true mothers out of hand and basked in the sunshine of their benevolent great white fathers to give the devil his due though for the life of me i cant think why i should old massa often treated such offspring more or less as his own children they came to make up the managerial class on the plantation and when the great white father passed on the plantation often went to his mulatto children this progressive paternalism has created a color caste in much of the caribbean the lines of which are drawn far sharper than any to be found in the usa many west indian mulattoes even today regard themselves as colored and look upon black west indians as negroes even niggers or darkies and obviously a lesser people yet in spite of this the establishment would have us believe that the entire struggle between black and white in this country has its roots in the determination of the whites to hold the line and maintain the purity of the races and the sanctity of the southern womanhood while the black man lives only for the day when he will catch miss anne with her restrictions down and that all else is verbiage and hypocrisy civil_rightsthe right to vote the right to work the right not to be lynched all the slogans about freedom and justice and equalityare merely part of a black master plan to get the black man into the white womans bed so he can mongrelize the races it is a peculiar fact that marrying whiteys daughter is always the first line of defense set up by the southern white man against the black yet it appears nowhere in the bill of particulars set forth by the black man in his case against the white establishment examine for days monthsyears if you willthe records of the naacp of core the urban league or sncc and you will find in none of their varied programs one single slogan about the right to marry mister charlies daughter historically it has always been a smoke screen set up by the white establishment to becloud any just demand of black folks its overall aim has been to maintain the status quo to keep the negro in his place at the bottom of the economic ladder and incidentally to keep the poor white near enough the bottom so that both of them would be shackled forever together in bondage to the southern way of life the poor white oftentimes had nothing save his vaunted whiteness to distinguish him from the black man just beneath him and what easier ruse than to convince him that his whiteness was in jeopardy that the black man wanted only to bed down with his white women to destroy his whiteness thus the black mystique had its humble beginnings as an economic and political expediency in order to carry out the grand design for exploitation known as the southern way of life you had to deny the black man any social or sexual equality because the alternative was to admit to the world and to the poor white southerner that the negro was not a beast but a man like any other man but if you kept him an animal obviously you would not be expected to invite him into your home to break bread at your table and eventually to marry your daughter or even grant him certain inalienable rightsto vote to hold office to work other than as a beast of burden to enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happinessbecause they were not endowed him by his creator but a mystique is never static in order to maintain it you must improve upon it to the myth of the animallike sexual obsession of the black man you must add the myth of great sexual prowess he is generously equipped for the sex act like a stud horse and equally tireless yet there is this too about mystiques eventually everybody believes the myths both the victims and the victimizers the mythmakers become the victims of their own propaganda so that when whitey the last of the great myth makers comes face to face with his victim the black man he really believes he stands before his sexual superior there is yet another dimension to this portrait is it not possible that the white man sees his own lust reflected in the black mans eyes a guilt constructed out of centuries of playing the role of sheik in the great white harem where black men were eunuchs and black women were concubines and though number one wife was always white she was merely a figurehead a wife and mistress in name only the black man a eunuch no longer looks upon all this and wonders has the great white harem made loveless all of white america have americans become a people anxious to be loved but incapable of loving has the black mystique developed a feeling of impotency that borders on a sexual inferiority complex and does it not stand to reason that this has left the white woman disinterested she was never a free soul in the harem she too was one of the exploited the myth about the black mans sexual prowess has undoubtedly made her more curious than she might ordinarily have been about the forbidden is it really true is he really as formidable a lover as they say he is is it any wonder that the white man lives with a builtin nightmare of his own construction he is afraid of retributionfrom both sides having historically been the exploiter of both women and black folk economically socially psychologically and sexually the two might even band together against him this may explain why the white woman seems to have less trouble than the white man in shedding her racial prejudices generalizations are dangerous but even among young liberals and progressives the white male appears to have a much harder struggle  i have studied young folk gathered in an office to get out a mailing for a civilrights demonstration more often than not the white girls mingle easily and with little or no selfconsciousness they will very usually put their heads and shoulders together with the black youth intent on getting the job done whereas you will often notice young white boys equally as dedicated and sincere much more selfconscious perhaps unknowingly they are watching for the interplay real or imagined between missy and young black joe it is the nature of the sickness of this society no soul is left unscathed the question about one of them marrying your daughter is of course a gratuitous insult to every white woman in this nation it is also very revealing of the state of mind of most of the white males in this country how came you to this abyss of insecurity where you shamelessly imply that your daughters come freedom will all dash lickety split and leap into the nearest black mans bed you have let your anxieties run away with your imagination after all marriage is a contract entered into freely by both parties that means that nobody can marry your daughter unless your daughter wills it and by the same token your daughter cannot marry a single one of uncle toms grandsons unless the grandson too wills it you and i in the final analysis do not cannot and should not have a damn thing to say about it i remember the summer when i was sixteen years old and worked at a hotel in my home town of macon ask any black bellhop you ran scared to death most of the time say they rang for room service in suite  you knew that room service meant any service the traffic would bear so when you reached the door you hesitated sometimes made the sign of the cross it was not unlike moving out onto the hollywood freeway swallowed hard and knocked knowing that once that door opened anything could happen the door finally swings back and there stands the white woman eternally aimed at your poor black head like a loaded rifle she can be in varied degrees of dishabille even like lady godiva sometimes without her horse standing there as if you do not exist as a man desexing you with her eyes though you suspect at the same time that she may covet you so you stand there sixteen years old feeling your age and knowing your place tonguetied and perspiring hating this white woman and yet somehow feeling a strange kind of pity for her then the gruff voice from the other room  tell the nigger to bring the stuff in here lucy belle but before you could get yourself together he comes stumbling naked toward the door hey boy what you looking at a white woman like that for you hate yourself for saying what you have to say im not looking at anybody sir no sir you calling me a liar boy no sir i just mean you were mistaken you turn to go the hell with the tip where you going boy bring that stuff on into the bedroom youre in the bedroom now nigger ever since you been in this suite you aint been able to keep your eyes off a miss lucy belle no sir you are mistaken sir whats the matter you think she ugly no sir i bet you got a great big tool all right what you reckon lucy belle leave the boy alone george henry there were two or three incidents like that per week with variations but somehow you got through the summer with your manhood and your sanity intact when i remember that summer and think of all the black men who have been lynched legally and otherwisethe scottsboro boys the martinsville seven willie mcgee and emmett tilli am certain that some white women must shudder at the way they have let themselves be used against the black man they have been the justification for every evil ever perpetrated in the name of southern womanhood white women must know they have been used and abused historically they still have very few rights that a white man must respect white women have prerogatives of inferiority and they have learned to live with them in this the white mans world some even look upon them as privileges the feminine mystique is as tricky as the black mystique and after all is said and done the white woman settles too for the masters leavings she eats much higher on the hog than black folk but the choicest morsels are still left for old massa there was a time when white and black women declared a common cause many of those in the suffragette and womens rights movement were also rabid abolitionists women like ernestine rose and many others frederick douglass the great abolitionist and exslave also made common cause with the struggle for womens rights he saw no contradiction is it any wonder that old massa lives with a growing horror that one day his victims both black and white might join forces a guilty conscience produces an inordinate amount of worrying 
the afromexicans
to say that mexico is a land of wonders artistic archeological and scenicis an obvious truism there live few with soul so dead who have not thrilled to an orozco mural the antiquity of chichen itza or the surreal beauty of popocatepetl by moonlight with its art history and cultural heritage mexico is a land that fairly begs for a traditional lost civilization a la james hilton and the writer has encountered more than one american who has gone home regretting that the mexican catalogue of wonders was more one of objects than of persons ruins paintings and volcanoes are fine butlets face it there is nothing that grips the popular imagination like the promise of a community of lost humans surviving in a remote shangrila well i have news there does exist in mexico a lostor to put it more accurately  completely overlooked civilization a culture so atypical so alien and so different from anything americans associate with mexico that it seems like an importation from another continent and another world its members are not as might be supposed descendants of aztecs or mayans undiscovered by the conquistadores and living as they did in montezumas day they are rather people of pure negro stock who presently inhabit a region of mexico that resembles the land of their origin in topography climate and as we shall see many other respects where does all this fit into the traditional ethnic concept of mexico as an indospanish country as opposed to say cuba or the dominican republic where the ethnic strain is afrospanish the answer is simply that the traditional view is absolutely correct and mexico is a spanishindian country while one encounters persons with negro blood in such gulf ports as tampico and veracruz this is true of gulf and caribbean port communities everywhere what confronts us here is in effect a black republic in the heart of mexicoa microcosm of africa set down in the middle of a spanishaztecmayanzapotec culture so purely african is this enclave that one is as unlikely to encounter whites indians or mestizos within its boundaries as in such places as accra or lagos how does this phenomenon affect the mexican image civilized americans of course reject the discredited stereotype of all mexicans as peons slumbering in the sun such types do exist but so does the mexican who flashes credit cards graduated from an american university and jets to new york to clinch big deals but the truly unknown mexican  unknown the writer discovered to many mexicans themselvesis a man whose ethnic roots are african rather than spanish andor indian and who lives in what is essentially an african community where is afromexico geographically it is a rectangularshaped area  miles long and  miles wide straddling the border between the two southern pacific coast states of guerrero and oaxaca it is bound on the south by the ocean and runs as far north as the halfruined city of ometepec once a goldmining center but now fallen into decay the african enclaves western extremity is the guerrero village of heuhuetan in the east it stops at the mixed afroindian town of pinotepa in oaxaca although smaller than long island afromexico offers an incredible diversity of topography and climate along the coast is a steamy tropical jungle region of mangrove swamps and coconut palms but less than five miles inland you find yourself on a plateau among the approaches to the towering sierra madre del sur this is cattle country sparselytreed and enjoying a temperate climate characteristic of the african veldt africa in miniature go to the seaside village of tecoanapa and youre on the tropical guinea coast then travel less than  miles to the hill town of cochpan and you find yourself in the invigorating uplands of kenya as interesting as the areas geography is its history how is it that a community of negro africans comes to be found in mexico the enclaves inhabitants are descendants of negroes who escaped from a fleet of contraband slave ships bound for acapulco during colonial times under laws of the spanish crown veracruz was the only port authorized to receive slave shipments but a number of illegal attempts were made to smuggle negroes into acapulco acapulco now an international resort but then new spains chief pacific port serviced the gold mining center of ometepec and san luis acatlan and it was believed that negroes were hardier than indians and better suited for backbreaking labor in the mines the fugitive slaves to their great good fortune found themselves in a terrain almost identical to their homeland taking to the hills and swamps they waged intermittent guerrilla warfare against soldiers of the spanish viceroy sent out to capture them this state of affairs continued until mexico achieved its independence in  and all slaves were freed the africans remained unmolested until the latter part of the th century when they were herded into settlements by a germanamerican adventurer from pittsburgh named johann schmidt schmidt who called himself don juan smith in mexico ruled over the area as a local tyrant until he was overthrown by the revolution of  with the downfall of schmidtsmith the negroes set up a virtually selfgoverning community and this is the situation that prevails to this day although the western border of afromexico is less than  miles from acapulco the enclaves existence is virtually unknown to the tourist throngs that invade the resort at the present time a modus vivendi exists between the mexican government and local authority in the region with the tacit understanding that federal intervention is kept at a minimum to make one point perfectly clear the african enclave can in no way be described as a ghetto or segregated area mexico is free of racial discrimination and persons who choose to leave the area are absorbed into mexican life at every level including intermarriage those who remain do so voluntarily and out of preference for their own way of life due to factors of geographical and cultural isolation estimates vary as to afromexicos present population the most widelyaccepted figure is  excluding persons of mixed negroindian or negrospanish blood who are found all along the costa chica a coastal strip running  miles between acapulco and puerto angel oaxaca i have mentioned the amazing diversity of topography and climate that exists within this minuscule area no less striking is the diversity one encounters among its inhabitants affirming the principle that personality is developed by environment rather than by such a nebulous concept as race afromexicans can be broken down into three distinct subculturesurban coastal and mountain the urban group consists of people born and raised in the area who have since chosen to join the mainstream of mexican life such integration has meant pulling up stakes and moving to the big citythe metropolis in this case being acapulco negroes mulattoes and lobos persons of mixed negroindian ancestry form a considerable percentage of the resorts indigenous population and the african influence creates an ambience completely atypical of mexico one that suggests rio or havana far more than mexico city or guadalajara the majority of these displaced negroes live in hillside communities on the outskirts of town and some of these areaslike la laja and calle ochorecall the favelas of black orpheus the african influence is also reflected in acapulcos music and typically mexican ranchero songs while still popular are given a strong run for their money by such afrocarib rhythms as the merengue or pachanga presence of a strong negroid strain among acapulquenos invariably creates confusion among tourists where do they come from this is a question i have had thrown at me repeatedly and my explanations have usually been greeted with utmost skepticism the idea of a negro mexican defies the american  and european  stereotype and i have heard afroacapulquenos explained as cuban refugees afroamericans west indians visiting africans and in fact as just about anything but what they actually were of the afromexicans who have remained in their homeland the coast people inhabit a number of fishing villages like tecoanapa in guerrero and corralero in oaxaca terrain here resembles not only the west african littoral but such transpacific locations as fiji new guinea and the solomon islands where the inhabitants though nonafrican are of negroid stock the coastal negroes are skilled swimmers and divers and of the ones who eventually make the move to acapulco many wind up as professional skindivers and water ski instructors yet a few miles inland you wont find one man in  who can swim a stroke but it is the hill folk of afromexico who will most actively stir the imagination of lost civilization enthusiasts for the land they inhabit furnishes daily a drama recalling the american wild west complete with ranches brandings roundups and even occasional range wars but if the area is isolated it is far from impoverished as it contains some of the best grazing country and finest herds in the republic such prosperity is reflected in the overall economy and the small town of cuajinicuilapa with less than  population has three movie houses an airport and is fully electrified for a community that size this is almost unprecedented in mexico another striking similarity between the region and our old frontier relates to views on crime in these uplands there are only two unforgivable offensesrustling and stealing horses lawbreaking of a nonbovine or equine nature is dealt with whenever possible by the victims family with police strongly discouraged from intervening but rustlers and horse thieves are handed over for quick  trial before courts that mete out a merciless justice for example a huehuetan girl of my acquaintance regularly takes friday afternoons off from work to visit her cousin in the acapulco city jail he is in the sixth year of a year sentence with the sure prospect of having to serve out his full term his offense was too serious to warrant consideration of pardon or even parole i inquired as to the nature of his crime and was told that he had been convicted of selling stolen butchers meat regardless of environmental differences both the amphibious coastal people and the herdsmen in the hills have in common a number of uniquely african folkways on the coast as in the mountains village huts are circularshaped constructed of wattle and topped by thatched roofs both coastal and mountain women carry loads and baskets on their headsthis accounts for the magnificent posture of afromexican girlsand babies are carried africanstyle astraddle the mothers hip indian women on the other hand carry babies in a rebozo or shawl the enchanting world of afromexico provides interest for americans of a wide variety of tastes and backgroundsfor the travel writer it is an untapped gold mine out of curiosity i scanned every guide book on mexico i could get my hands on and encountered only onethe revised edition of terrys guide to mexicothat even mentions the region the negro enclave is also an anthropologists dream and budding ashley montagues and margaret meads as they cover the area will find source material to fill a score of scholarly monographs if any remain unconvinced i make the following suggestion on their next trip to acapulco let them invest the round trip per passenger price of a small charter planeand visit either cuajinicuilapa guerrero or santo domingo oaxaca both communities serviced by airfields then let them say that mexico has no lost civilization
the negro and the police
ew york city police lt thomas r gilligan shot james it  powell to death and   harlem dissolved into an angry riot the uproar that started there set off a chain reaction that spread to several other cities immediately after the rioting sociologists psychiatrists and city officials set themselves to the task of finding out just how it all got started in the first place one of the reasonsand often the trigger that sets off violence in the streets is the hate and fear that exists between negroes and the police but hostility between the negro and the police is not manifested once a year in spectacularly isolated instances like the harlem riot the feeling is there week after week year after year and it is evident in hundreds of small incidents that do not receive newspaper coverage the u s commission on civil_rights has stated that police brutality is one of the major injustices in america today case histories documented in the commissions report reveal that the civil liberties of negroes in the custody of the police have been flagrantly violated in  chief detective pape and  chicago policemen broke into james monroes apartment monroe and his wife were wakened and forced to stand in the center of the bedroom while their six children were lined up in the living room pape reportedly hit monroe several times calling him nigger and black boy another policeman was accused of assaulting mrs monroe several of the children said they were kicked and beaten monroe was taken to jail and held on an open charge for  hours he was denied the right to call a lawyer he was denied the right to appear before a magistrate he was  finally released without any charges being filed against him in  in the case of monroe vs pape the u s supreme court rendered a decision which permitted monroe to sue the chicago police department for violating the federal civil_rights act an naacp report on police practices in a large california city contained this case history a police officer went to investigate a complaint according to the naacp he was belligerent and choked one of the negroes to the ground a fight followed during which the officer was hit on the head with a womans shoe twentyfive arrests followed this incident it was presumed by the officers that one of the men involved in the fight knew who had struck the officer with the shoe he was taken to a secluded spot and beaten later booked in city jail and contrary to usual practice no photographs were taken of him lack of restraint by police is shown not only in individual incidents but in confrontations with civil_rights demonstrators as well in princess anne maryland peaceful picketing of segregated restaurants turned into a riot the state police used dogs clubs and fire hoses to break up the crowd of negro students one demonstrator threw acid on the leg of a state trooper burning him slightly several of the students were bitten by the dogs and kicked by police when on the ground fortysix students had injuries ranging from bloody noses to concussions fourteen were bitten by dogs five so badly they needed stitching in new york recently a group of parents demonstrated to dramatize the need for a traffic light near a harlem school their protest resulted in several arrests and charges of police brutality by demonstrators it was alleged that police kicked shoved and struck women and children as they broke up the gathering mrs alice kornegay said that police kicked her in front of the school mrs vonnie jordan president of the schools pta charged that police kicked us and hit us while making their arrests a yearold boy said that the police struck him in the side while he was walking along the street near the demonstration several recent incidents in los angeles illustrate that feeling between the police and the negro is dangerously explosive a policeman was knocked unconscious and windows of two patrol cars smashed by a mob following a high school track meet other policemen were showered with sticks and stones by spectators who objected to the arrest of a youth who had been ejected from the stadium more than  officers were summoned before the crowd estimated at  was dispersed the next day police officers ambulance attendants and victims of a busauto collision were assaulted by a rock throwing crowd that gathered at the scene of the accident an officer said that rocks cement and bottles were thrown at them as they attempted to aid the injured both these incidents occurred in south los angeles the negro district of that city soon after these outbreaks of violence two negro members of the los angeles city council recommended increased training in community relations for policemen billy g mills one of the councilmen refused to label police tactics as discriminatory but pointed out that he is stopped on numerous occasions by policenot because i am violating the law but because they see me at night driving a car provided by the city william h parker chief of the los angeles police dept blamed the disturbances on social unrest and resentment against all forms of government authority he said we have long been concerned about the tendency to blame the police for the inability of some people to conform to the law but james farmer national director of core said that negro social unrest stems to a large degree from police brutality police do not respect the negroes rights as a citizen so how can negroes respect the police he continued the feeling in the negro community especially in the north is stronger against police brutality than anything else a resident in a negro community after witnessing a fight between white police officers and a young traffic offender who happened also to be a negro tried to analyze the cause of the disorder she said its just they dont have the right approach they dont respect you what are you going to do what are we going to do malcolm_x thought he had the solution he said it is criminal to teach a man not to defend himself when he is the constant victim of brutal attacks it is legal and lawful to own a rifle and louis lomax at a conference on civil equality at pomona college said that the nonviolent negro revolt has just about run its course he said nonviolence is downright unamerican and one of the reasons you dont respect me and you call me boy is that i dont defend myself while lomax did not spell out exactly what forms he thought the new revolution of selfdefense might take it is certain that confrontations between police and civil_rights groups would not be exempt from the extreme militant approach but when malcolm_x advocated the unlawful use of guns he was approving the acts of the lee harvey oswalds of this world when louis lomax derides the nonviolent movement he spurns the obvious gains made by dr martin_luther_king recipient of the nobel peace prize surely it is possible to   solve the most difficult problems within the framework of existing law history has proven that the extreme limits of selfjustification and selfdefense can only lead to anarchy many people involved in the study of the relations between the police and the negro feel that the education of the police officer in minority group problems has been seriously neglected they contend that the police have been unwilling to recognize the fact that socioeconomic factors have a direct bearing on individual behavior courses offered the recruit are neither long enough nor intensive enough worse still most police departments stubbornly insist on having police officers instead of trained social scientists teach such courses dr charlotte epstein a social scientist and author of the book intergroup relations for police officers supports this criticism according to dr epstein the men should be given every possible opportunity to come to grips with their own prejudices and learn how to control them in the performance of their duty they should be helped to eliminate from their framesofreference all the stereotypes all the misconceptions about racial religious and nationality minorities they also need thorough grounding in our concept of lawnot only in specific ordinances but in the meaning of the law the spirit of the law the extension of the law to the everyday relationships of men dr epstein also says in addition to study of group prejudices and law they need some broadening in other human relations concepts for example their responses to the problems of homosexuality are so personal and emotional that they undoubtedly interfere in their impartial dealings with homosexuals their attitudes toward college students artists bearded men and toward women need exploration and understanding what must not be overlooked is a thorough investigation of the relationship between race and crime covering the many misconceptions extant concerning this relationship lack of proper grounding in the social sciences is one reason for hostility between negroes and the police but there are other reasons as well during the s the negro population had a net increase of  percent while whites increased  percent at the end of the fifties for the first time in history more than half of all negroes were living outside the south with the greatest increase in the far west seventy two percent of all negroes now live in urban areas as opposed to  percent white in spite of these increases in population and a knowledge of the potential explosion that comes with them city governments have been reluctant to allocate more money for improved police training methods for accelerated recruitment programs or for policemens salaries huge urban complexes such as new york los angeles chicago and detroit have let slums grow unheeded have allowed and sometimes encouraged de facto segregation in schools have done too little too late about fair employment practices have seen their crime rate rise year after year and then have professed to be shocked when their police force has to cope with race riots but the vast majority of citizens must along with their city officials accept part of the blame intellectually we know that the police are necessary but emotionally we wish just to be left alone since we do not want to see or hear or know the police the problems that are particularly indigenous to law enforcement agencies no matter in what area do not touch us we are reluctant to call the police if a neighbor has broken the law we think twice about offering a policeman help if he is in trouble we utter lofty sentiments about the sacredness of law and order and at the same time we reject those who are sworn to protect that law and order although the reasons behind conflicting feelings are very different white sentiment about the negro closely parallels that felt about the police the majority of white americans advocate equal treatment for all but emotional uneasiness about the negros drive for equality often tends to negate what whites know intellectually is legally and morally right according to a newsweek magazine survey whites feel by a margin of  that negroes are moving too fast twotoone are against lunchroom sitins fivetothree are against picketing and  are against liedowns in front of trucks at construction sites resistance is greatest where negroes are trying to cross in large numbers into working class communities especially those of immigrant descent in the recent presidential primary in wisconsin gov george wallace of alabama received  percent of the vote he received a strong vote from labor while his heaviest democratic vote was among those of polish descent an naacp float in a st patricks day parade in south boston bearing the slogan from the fight for irish freedom we must fight for american equality was bombarded with rocks beer bottles and cherry bombs in seattle washington a fair housing ordinance was turned down by a  vote despite heavy support from church and civic leaders and on november rd  californians passed proposition  which if not declared unconstitutional by the courts will nullify virtually all of californias fair housing laws perhaps the negro and the police are singled out for abuse by a disgruntled white populace because they are both so obvious the policeman with his uniform the negro because of the color of his skin both are effectively isolated both are harassed both are at one time or another spat upon and when two such alien groups are backed into a comer it is inevitable that they should turn and snarl at each other a substantial portion of negro charges that the police are hostile to minority group aspirations is dismissed by many as hysterical mudslinging by an agitated people but john milner professor of social work at the university of southern california and until recently a parttime teacher of police in human relations problems had this to say i can say that the policemen and women seem to be generally prejudiced against the negro this attitude stems from two major reasons one the police personnel tend to come from lower class or lower middle class families two the police fear the negro and with good reason the need to deal with the uneducated delinquent type who regard all constituted authority with hostility the crime and delinquency rate among the negro population is extremely high and much of the policemans work is taken up with them and to him they seem the major social problem he sees no way to handle them except by control he therefore fears their being given more freedom capitals supplied mr milner goes on to say that i have found this prejudiced attitude quite common to police from all parts of the u s those working in the major cities seem to fear them negroes even more than do police in the smaller southern communities it has always been a point of discussion in my classes whether or not the negro is a subhuman being as some policemen in every class have insisted the negro does not respond in the same way as the white to their use of authority and they see them as a different type of delinquent  the police tend to view demonstrations as rowdyism as exhibitionism in its crudest form they think of the revolution as essentially a rebellion against the status quo this strikes a sensitive nerve for the police dearly love the status quo it is their sworn duty after all to protect it the police do not seek sensationalism they do not court controversy they do in fact abhor it one of the policemens fondest and most legitimate desires is to be viewed as a professional man equipped through intelligence training and efficiency to do a difficult job to achieve this goal the police have in the past several years been paying more and more attention to public relations the art of creating a good image is an important part of every recruits training the negro with his noisy attentiongetting ways is threatening to spoil all these efforts he is reviving old cries of police brutality and dumb cop he is creating front page headlines and pictures of police dragging demonstrators off to jail he is then more than a nuisance more than a crime statistic he is in policemens eyes a dangerous threat to a much desired elevation in status occasionally when criticism of police practices in negro ghettos in large cities becomes too vocal the police hold a public meeting to discuss grievances one such meeting was held recently in southern california and although it was well publicized in advance fewer than forty people attended at the meeting no complaints were received the police immediately seized on the lack of complaints as proof that no problems exist but this simple explanation ignores the fact that for over  years any desire on the part of the negro to speak out against injustice has been swiftly repressed so if negroes do not come forth to speak out in lawful assembly their reluctance to meet the white man on his own territory should be understandable it is unfortunate that this reasoning which is based on historical fact completely escapes the police it is little wonder then that a large majority of negroes have little faith in citizens committees or biracial councils or in the humanitarianism of the law instead they take to the streets to fight the shadowy ghosts of inequality and they use the same weapons their oppressors have always used against them fear intimidation and violence when negroes do take to the streets policemen are frightened they see themselves as the only thing standing between angry negroes and a complacent white society as such they tend to exaggerate the potential violence of individuals and soon have trouble distinguishing between a peaceful civil_rights demonstration and an angry mob the policeman is the obvious target for hate and a need for violence he is the man who must face and deal with the lunatic fringe the dissident elements who become angry individuals the rioters who strike out blindly at any symbol of authority but the law must not become a club to beat down those who seek to arouse us it must not protect those who seemingly deserve it and oppress those who are the havenots in our society there can be no flexible scale to determine who is to be granted civil liberties and who is to be denied them the great wisdom in the bill of rights decrees that civil liberties are each individuals inherent right no matter what his status or his crime what must we do to ease the fear and prejudice that poisons actions and communication between the negro and the police a predominantly white society which purportedly believes in the dignity of the individual and the sacredness of the law has tried to banish both the necessity of the police and the shame of the negro from its conscious thoughts in a very real sense this society has relegated the negro and the policeman as well to a position of secondclass citizenship worse yet both groups have been placed in a position which for one or the other may soon become untenable we must as citizens as community leaders as members of a minority race or members of a major power structure as individuals and in groups work in courtrooms in jail cells on street comers and in alleys to see to it that a negros rights his dignity and at times his person are protected we must use our influence and our tax dollars to demand that policemen are exposed to more sophisticated and more extensive instruction in community relations and we must somehow convince the policeman that his status and his security are not being threatened by the negros drive to achieve the same goals whether he likes it or not our faceless john doe is involved when a nightstick cracks into someones skull he is involved in the civil_rights movement he is involved in the policemans objectives and his prejudices it is imperative that every citizen realize that this is happening to him it is clear that only this awareness will stir him into taking an active role in helping himself solve this great american dilemma 
i have not yet read or heard anyone speak of the historical significance of malcolm_x more tragic than his all men die sooner o later was that it was precipitated in the early days of a basic change in his philosophy perhaps it would be more precise to say jelling of his philosophy for his break with the old man elijah muhammad was the change and all that followed until his murder was really a quest for what this sensitive and dramatic angry man knew could be found somewhere in spite of america for me his search was consciously or unconsciously the reclamation of the black mans masculinity sociologically what focus the negro family has had parentally has been for the most part matriarchalthat is centered in the motherfigure the racist critics who disparage the instability of negro family life fail to note that there was no concept of family life in the negro community in the south until just a hundred years ago then following emancipation the leftover evils of slavery some of which are much in evidence today contributed largely to the suppression of the fatherfigure in the already weakened and sometimes broken family circle reconstruction followed by separate but equal and the coupling with antebellum traditions prevented the negro male from becoming a man the only course left was survival by accommodation  being an uncle tom the male head of the negro family could defend neither his woman nor his children he was impotent politically and economically he ab solved violence and death without cause or purpose having had to stand by and see his children starved and his women raped the negro man either resigned his manhood or physically fled his responsibility as the only alternatives to sure death the end result of this circumstance was for the negro child to be almost totally dependent upon the female head of the family for strength direction hope whatever children for the last three or four generations have grown to manhood and womanhood under this matriarchal influence necessitated by loss of the negro males masculinity this is why brother malcolm has historical importance as he was symptomatic of the terrible ills that beset our nation domestically he was also symptomatic of the solution to those ills black and white people who regretted and resented the presence of a malcolm_x would have done better to have regretted and resented the society that produced him it must be noted that as malcolm made an impact on society in reciprocal fashion he felt its impact on him how was it that a malcolm_x never appeared on the scene until the nonviolent movement led by martin_luther_king jr had reached thunderous proportions all of the problems have been just about the same for the last one hundred years one who is a thoughtful student of sharp social change can recognize the telltale dynamics of revolution given a martin_luther_king jr there had to be a malcolm_x in earlier days dr_king was considered by most in the national community circa  a dangerous wildeyed perverter of religion with demagogic power and obvious communist sympathies whites were not alone in swallowing hard at his extremist tactics enter malcolm_x and dr_king in contrast to the fiery outpourings of malcolm_x a la muhammad necessarily became more palatable to the american scene king the pioneer of a new militancy provokes a response that purports to outking king thus malcolm represented a newly found assertiveness that had lain dormant too long in the minds of men of color casual observers m of the present american scene in race relations mistakenly assess malcolm as more militant and dr_king as less militant when in reality each practiced distinctly different methodologies dr_king by the nature and practice of nonviolence could not be more militant malcolms practice was far less militant than his theory militancy is more accurately measured by how determinedly one pursues and achieves his goals dr_king chose nonviolence as his methodology and has steadily escalated and broadened his attack against the evils of bigotry and prejudice so much so that his work now tangentially is of significance to international affairs malcolms methodology was verbalized as an eyeforaneye in earlier days and softened to selfdefense in later days the goals of both though not always described as such were basically securing a fair shake for the black man in america dr_kings techniques have proved to be not only religious and morally rooted but also practically and realistically productive however charitably one may view the work of malcolm_x the same caliber of results are not evident not everyone can buy the nonviolent stratagems of dr_king and company though i am proud to be counted in his number few precious few can academically and functionally accept nonviolence as a way of life all those who are left are not necessarily spineless or violent there are certainly those like malcolm whose manhood was challenged strengthened by the repeated heroism of men women and children of the deep south in the face of awesome hardships physical and emotional the nonviolent movement in the south broke the shackles from many chained minds in the north through its raw courage alone a malcolm_x a jesse gray a milton galamison had to do something though they would not or could not abide by the discipline of the kingled forces who turn the other cheek to some degree this may explain some character of disconnectedness in the thrust of the negro community in our large urban centers of the north the newfound assertiveness of the negro  in the north went off in as many different directions as the personalities through whom it was filtered at some points as in the case of last summers looting and socalled riots its misdirection and lack of discipline degenerated into senseless violence in almost every instance it expressed itself most vehemently at that point in society where the negro male has been emasculated most  confrontation with law enforcement officials malcolm brought whitey down front and men who had cowered inwardly and outwardly in the presence of the nameless white face in whose world he moved admired his spunk and grit vicariously through him some negro men got up off their knees for the first time in their lives and touched their manhood as if it were a new christmas toy what am i saying we should make the late mr little st malcolm not at all malcolm was guilty at times of useless illogical and intemperate remarks that helped neither him nor his cause i personally could never buy black nationalism nor could i recommend it even if conditions for black men were infinitely worse than they are but all the world must agree that malcolm had the book on white america and he read it loud and clear for all to hear the press generally more from naivete than from malice wrote malcolm off rather quickly at death almost summarily as living and dying by the sword this was neither a fair or accurate assessment of the late malcolm_x careful study of malcolms preachments particularly after his break with elijah muhammad reveal primarily focus on being problack as versus being antiwhite as he was erroneously described in epitaph a secondary focus was his insistence on the right of an individual to protect the sanctity of his home life and property with arms as over against his newspaperproduced reputation of encouraging black to take up arms against white these are fine shades of differences but absolutely crucial to understanding the historical importance of brother malcolm the current lowbudget movie nothing but a man is the story of another malcolm fictitious yet very real who can be found all over this land dove anderson the main character wasnt looking for trouble or running away from it either his unverbalized goal in this magnificent picture was to be nothing but a man thats what malcolm_x was all about he was the symbol of negro males who though groping have not yet found the answer to how they can be nothing but a man which is really more than enough 
the emptiness of negro middle class church life
i know that it is a hazi  ardous mission to un dertake an examina rv tion of the weaknesses qf mjdde dass negro church life accordingly while exercising care and all due moderation in my deliberations i shall also frequently rely on the observations of eminent sociologists and theologians to back up most of my contentions they too have reluctantly come to recognize a growing emptiness in black bourgeoisie church life besides in many ways this analysis is a commentary on white middle class church life after which the negro middle class generally is patterned in fact the most ostensible difference between white and negro middle class church life though there are others as we shall seeis that negro church services usually last twice as long for reasons that will become clear as we go along one reason why negro services last so long is the desire for everybody to have a word and the necessity for welcoming all visitorsbut more about that later a cue to the middle class negro mentality may be found in a comparison of church songs used by lower class negroes and the middle class regardless of what may be said of the lower class at least their songs have meaning in that they symbolize malcontent and a desire to escape their deprivation they at least are bent on going somewhere therefore their songs frequently contain some reference to a vehiclea chariot a train bound for the promised land  which will swing down some day by and by and take them out of their misery failing that they plan to walk through that valley or ill fly away on the other hand recent visits to middle class negro churches revealed anthems and such titles as rejoice and be glad and it is well with my soul these symbolize their acquiescence and complacent contentment but before examining in detail the emptiness of middle class negro church life let us look at the background factors to their behavior unlike white middle class individuals many of whom are the children of middle class parents many middle class negro individuals grew up as lower class persons as they move up the status ladder many grow dissatifled with membership in the lower class churches they have known in early life they accordingly switch into churches not identified with the negro others choose a church because of its prestige the faculty of a college in the south where i once taught has been known to join whatever church the president belongs to when they had an episcopalian president most were episcopalians later when they obtained a baptist president most joined the baptist church he attended e franklin frazier found professionals such as lawyers and doctors belonging to two churches one for prestige while retaining membership in a lower class church in order to attract a clientele some other persons retain membership in two denominations because they are reluctant to let their parents back home know they have switched denominations large churches also serve a status value the abyssinian baptist church in harlem is said to be the largest in the united states in many others in the north where migrant negroes have experienced new status gains persons desiring a seat must go long before services begin this is not so much a reflection of mushrooming piety as it is a passion for big churches accordingly many churches overreport their membership and yet these mass churches are characterized by anonymity and a loss of individuality on the part of members in addition middle class negro churches seek to sever their identity with negro lower class churches gibson winters the suburban captivity of the church has pointed out that negro middle class churches often form a buffer  against the lower class community they reject the lower class yet they must live with constant reminders of their common heritage and their own recent escape from the southern lower class the aggravation stemming from this fact led one middle class minister to comment that storefront churches merely express pentup emotions and moreover that people of this type lower class church members are in the first stages of insanity vattel daniel writing in the american sociological review reported that many middle class negro christians regard deep religious devotion as synonymous with lower class worship getting happy for example in a black bourgeoisie church is strictly taboo and according to st clair drake in black metropolis a person who admits to being sanctified is immediately labeled lower class thus the middle class has generally become alienated from the lower class churches and their problems what should be the biggest source of mission is ignored meanwhile some take missions to help civilize or christianize africa and even contribute to such funds as white educational enterprises on the other hand during my days as a member of a middle class negro church i sat and watched the deacons escort a middle aged woman who being lower class was responding with oral enthusiasm to the ministers message straight out of the church at the ministers request frazier in the negro church told how middle class negroes have tried to remove identification as negroes from their churches the colored methodist episcopal cme became the christian methodist episcopal there has also been some effort to get the ame african methodist episcopal changed to the american methodist episcopal but the masses rejected the move another sociologist reported as early as  that many middle class negroes were severing their affiliation with churches traditionally associated with negroes  baptist methodist  and joining others with nonnegro identities such as the catholics lutherans and episcopalian thus churches with a majority of lower class members among whites such as the catholics and the lutherans become upper class negro churches in moving up the status ladder some seem to get the impression as they follow whites to the suburbs and where possible into their staid congregations that they also are moving out of the negro race they appear to believe that heaven is surely integrated and therefore the only way to heaven is through the doors of an integrated church they covet white church membership as an earthly symbol of the paradise they perceive accordingly they stage prayins not to mention unpublicized slinkins to gain admission to congregations that have failed to demonstrate true christian ways such congregations have lagged behind the courts and the schools in accepting negroes and have as a group only subsequently begun spouting some sympathy for their negro brethren and their predicament nor have they raised their voices in a sustained fashion on any other major evil of todays world such as war and imperialism we do not expect that middle class negroes who hunger for the white brand of religion will have anything much to say about these issues either but not only is the middle class negro church a caricature of the white church it surpasses the white church in some areas of organized distraction for example the negro middle class church was found by frazier the negro church to be the most materialistic religious group in the united states this is indicated by the competition for finery visible in elaborate buildings and furnishings and in the members struggle to outdress one another at church affairs some persons feel out of place if they are not well togged the bulk of the collection generally goes to the building fund while only about  per cent according to benjamin mays and nicholson in the negros church is given to missions education and the like in spite of the emphasis on the erection of grand physical structures many members are found to hedge on giving their share to the collection plate less than half of the reported membership in the negro church were found by mays and nicholson to pay their dues regularly the larger the church the fewer the contributions in relation to the members in that more can hide behind anonymity in the group this gives rise to numerous and complex appeals for contributions in the effort to wring money from stingy members some churches instruct communicants to march by the collection table up front on the assumption that they will be too ashamed to walk by without giving anything this exercise usually follows and complements previous passings of the collection plate some follow the general offering with sacrificial offerings in addition envelopes are often distributed to members and contributions given official credit this is in contrast to the lower class practice of taking collection by merely whipping up the spirit of the members on the spot the emptiness of the middle class negro church also emerges in the formality of their exercises which though similar to that of the white middle class is more intense according to gibson winters in the suburban captivity of the church not only do they require subdued expression of religious emotions with orderliness and uniformity they also frown on verbal outbursts and are afraid to clap their hands even if the spirit should move them to do so i recently noted with interest the admonition in a middle class negro church program enter the sanctuary in silence also whereas songs once were started by anyone so moved now ritualistic monotony is broken only by an occasional standing to accompany the organ in rendering a hymn thus they are adopting the ritualismasanendinitself approach characteristic of white congregations described in morris l wests novel the devils advocate while we do not need to dwell on the antics of negro middle class ministers as i have discussed that in another study see have negro ministers failed their roles negro digest july  the emptiness of the sermons of many ministers is apparent the subject of a middle class sermon  recently heard was why everybody should go to church while some especially in the south do capitalize on the drama of the negros struggle for equality many label such sermons derogatorily as political speeches many are bent on saving souls instead of the race others would prefer to save members for their churches than to save souls they accordingly spend much time on biblical legend rather than on the worlds current problems this grows in part from a desire to show off knowledge of biblical history learned in white divinity schools the longwinded among  them likewise are given to spouting grand theology and yet while they have produced some leaders in the field of race relations they have not according to joseph washington himself a leading negro minister produced any firstrate theologians this is partly due to their opposition to intellectual efforts within the area of religion whereas ministers used to whoop up their audiences to righteousness they now whisper into microphones instead of chastizing members for their wrongdoings in the middle class they now read an assurance of pardon preceding the reading of their prepared sermons this leads to conflicts with their members ruby johnston the development of negro religion found ministers far less tolerant toward emotionalism than church laymen they have accordingly lost some of the rapport between speaker and members who used to indicate approval and spur the minister on in the middle class the minister now appears as a formal lecturer anyone who forgets and says amen will be looked upon with scorn this formality is regarded as progress and culture since middle class church services necessarily are more cold and impersonal compared to the lower class they lose and miss a basic warmth and intimacy many are not even known by their pastors whom they see only on sunday thus the necessity for fellowhip and acceptance in a variety of committees and associations others must complement their associational life with pseudoreligious fraternities clubs and lodges they form hospitality committees to fill an apparent absence of hospitality in addition there is a plethora of interests peripheral to church worship itself there is a proliferation of clubs associations missions fellowships auxiliaries orientation dinners and other recreational activities and organizations to compensate for social maladjustment to city life this is not to mention the various raffles and bizarres to compensate for low contributions already discussed reflecting in part the growing secularization of american society many according to joseph washington confuse religiosity with faith indeed some adopt a cynical attitude toward faith ruby johnston found in a study of  persons that of those expressing a belief in god only  were warm in their expression and only  enthusiastic of those expressing a belief in prayer only  were warm and  enthusiastic this is not even to mention that some of those who were enthusiastic were no doubt giving lip service to an acceptable folkway in any case many feel that it is necessary only to profess membership without following the dictates of their faith or even attending services religious affiliation is enough for them vattel daniel found churchgoing not important especially for upper class negroes in other churches there is a high turnover of membership with members bouncing from church to church in search of spiritual satisfaction those who attend church services have failed to make any significant contributions to theology in part because they have sat back and gloated over the fact that christ died for us even the famous white lawyer clarence darrow once told a negro congregation to get off their knees and do something rather than rear back and wait to be redeemed in mimicking white religious bodies negro middle class congregations are fast becoming as empty as their coveted model but they will have to go far beyond white religious models if they are going to be successful in promoting high religious ideals
jim crow justification sixties style
i am just as opposed to booker t washington as a voter with all his anglosaxon reinforcements as i am to the cocoanut headed chocolate colored typical little coon andy dotson who blacks my shoes every morning thus andy dotson went down in american history along with u s senator james k vardaman of mississippi who made that statement in a speech in  during his governorship he had expressed an equally strong opposition to educating the negros head and he stated bluntly that negroes would always be only a servant class in mississippiand in all the states ultimately as a member of the mississippi house of representatives  governor  u s senator  vardaman was significantly instrumental in designing establishing and defending a pattern of rigid humiliating and exploitative racial segregation which did ultimately encompass the entire deep southbut hardly all of the union and now this anomalous caste system in american democracy is under incessant attack from many quarters but like any established human institution under attack it has its staunch defenders among those warmly defending segregation are notably most of the white southern clergymen in upholding the racial status quo they are however only acting in a traditional role during the abolition movement the southern clergy stoutly defended chattel slavery as necessary to the continuation of our civilization today dr clayton sullivan a baptist minister of tylertown mississippi thinks that at the present time in the rural south segregation is a social necessity a device to stave off cultural disintegration speaking out saturday evening post april   but before the end of his article his present time has merged with the distant future for he sees a complex negro problem that is going to be around for generations to come a further glimpse into southern history which dr sullivan almost completely ignores will better indicate why segregation was devised it should be understood that the establishment of segregation was definitely not the restoration of a social order that had existed before the civil war it was instead a new order of a kind that would have been impractical with the close association during slavery further this new order was not instituted immediately after reconstruction see the strange career of jim crow by c vann woodward in fact there was a considerable period of uneasy respite for the negro people during which negroes shared in the use of public facilities held local state and national offices and served on juries and on the bench for instance in  two years after the removal of federal occupation troops from the south negroes in jackson were using hamilton park for picnics and angelos hall for dancesthe same park that white church ladies used for fetes and the same hall that whites used for dances and for democratic conventions for several years most mississippi saloons served customers of both races at the same bar providing separate tables for each race many restaurants served all comers in the same room rigidity in interracial relations came to mississippi later and relaxed relations between the races was more manifest and lasted longer in other states in  eight years after home rule had been restored a negro journalist traveled from boston to south carolina with a chip on my shoulder and found the south ahead of the north in relaxed and friendly relations between the races that same year a northern visitor in new orleans was greatly surprised if not shocked by the free and easy race relations there also the period of office holding by negroes was not confined to reconstruction the last negro congressman from the changing south was george h white of north carolina who completed his term in  and negroes in large numbers continued to vote in the south on through the nineties negroes were eventually disfranchised by indirection through constitutional trickery that began in mississippi in  and ended as late as  in georgia ironically one duly elected delegate to the mississippi constitutional convention of  was a negro i t montgomery the central purpose of this convention openly avowed but not officially acknowledged was to disfranchise the negro montgomery estimated the new constitution would eliminate  negro voters but only  whites see from slavery to freedom by john hope franklin in  thirteen years after the restoration of home rule mississippi had  registered negro voters in  she had  the respite for the negro people was indeed uneasy negro lynching was proceeding apace during the period of negro voting this summary method of rendering justice reached its high point in  when  people were lynched roughly three per week and sometimes and in some places negro voters were marched in from a plantation and voted and some of them were often kept away from the polls by trickery or intimidation and some of their votes were often stolen yet their votes in considerable numbers did often count rival politicians vied with one another for the negro vote respectfully addressing a voter as mister so incidentally voting rights not only afforded negroes occasions for a sense of ordinary human dignity but they also exerted a cultural influence upon politicians but if you want to degrade an enfranchised people the first logical step is to disfranchise them after the negro was disfranchised in any state his social abasement could proceed without consideration of political expediency besides negro disfranchisement would stop rival white factions from stealing the negro vote that became a popular argument though rigid segregation in the south was welcomed by many for economic psychological and social reasons it was sanctioned by the old line aristocratic conservative democrats seasoned and skillful politicians only when a political crisis seriously threatened their overthrow hoping to attract northern and eastern industry and capital to the redeemed south they had begun to support the interests of the railroads the big banks and other corporations but the poor whites as well as the negroes needed low freight rates and easy money in order to prosper even moderately for many small farmers high freight rates and hard money led directly to mortgage foreclosures since no middle class as such had yet arisen in the south nearly all of the white population belonged to the small farmer class so in the eighties third parties began to arise to challenge the conservative whiglike democrats as greenbackers independents or readjusters these political rebels made no headway but when the populists members of the peoples party appeared on the southern scene in large numbers in the nineties they posed a real threat to the serene supremacy of the conservative democrats the white populists not only welcomed negroes as members they also gave them positions in the policy making councils of the party the farming whites and the negroes had a pressing common interest that for a time drew them together politically they shared a grinding poverty as one white delegate to a state populist convention expressed it they were both in the same ditch the populists won many local elections across the south populist sheriffs a different breed from the segregationist sheriffs of today were quite common and in their counties negroes generally were treated as fullfledged citizens at least by the sheriffs the populists with the aid of the republicans were actually able to gain political control of one state north carolina to the conservative democrats the prospects of a permanent political union between large numbers of whites and negroes became truly a clear and present danger and when these rebels began to talk about land reform they became an intolerable menace but the democrats had in reserve one surefire weapon which they were now ready to unlimber color prejudice a broad campaign of vilification against the negro people was carried on simultaneously with the disfranchising drive ttiis campaign enlisted the services of the press public forums the pulpit and the authors of books one book which appeared in  was entitled the negro a beast or in the image of god lynching was the strongarm part of this campaign to put the negro in his place and keep him there by a blatant and massive appeal to the dormant race prejudice that slumbered unacknowledged if not unrecognized in the frustrated breasts of many populists the democrats were able to wreck the peoples party in state after state the name of the party disappeared from the ballot in  tom watson of georgia was the last populist presidential candidate but the peoples party was dead for a quarter of a century watson had fought gallantly sometimes dangerously for negro rights and for populism but in  he too climbed on the bandwagon of negrophobia and thus became the antinegro political boss of georgia after the death of the populist party the poor whites in their untutored poverty could at least have the pleasure of looking down upon the niggersthe booker t washingtons along with the andy dotsons but the negroes stripped of political allies were inextricably enmeshed in the relentlessly closing net of cold segregation in its rigid legalized form segregation is chiefly a twentieth century product up to  jim crow laws applied only to railroad travel except that georgia alone had some jim crow street cars montgomery did not have separate street car facilities until  and before  only three states had separate waiting rooms in fact practically all segregation laws were enacted early in this century whites only and colored were twentieth century signs we managed to get along without for decades after emancipation louisiana didnt get around to separating its circus patrons by law until  and it was  before south carolina law even began to require separate facilities for factory workers in design and operation the new order of segregation was the best available substitute for slavery its central purpose was to degrade the negro people socially exploit them economically and stultify them mentally if it also had the effect of abasing some of them morally that should not be at all surprising for it certainly increased the moral insensitivity of many white people lacking historical knowledge most segregationists view the negro problem simply segregationists are the good guys and integrationists are the bad guys unquestionably there is a tremendous social problem in the deep south but the attitude of the local white power structure is the central obstacle to a rational handling of the problem many in positions of influence and power are still fighting the civil war as the wide official display of the old confederate flag clearly indicates many white people of that region have never fully accepted the emancipation proclamation much less the fifteenth amendment like the late senator vardaman fhey want the negro to be always a servant in order to maintain this de facto servitude the whites have wisely from their view point refused to recognize the negros full citizenship and to allow him to vote likewise they have been prudent in refusing to educate his head an informed and enfranchised servant class would of course vote itself out of servitude in dixie a vestigial sense of personal ownership of negroes which lingers on from the days of chattel slavery often comes out in casual conversation in rural areas a negro whom someone does not recognize is always identified as one of mr broadacres niggers dr sullivan finds an appalling chasm that separates most of the rural negroes from the mainstream of american life but surely he knows that segregation was deliberately devised and designed for the very purpose of separating negroes from the mainstream of american life segregate v t to separate or cut off from others or from the general masswebster the width and depth of that chasm only testify to the tragic success of segregation in a manner characteristic of segregationists dr sullivan reverses the cause and effect relationship he takes the appalling effects of segregation as a justifiable cause to continue it indefinitely that is a pleasing and satisfying way to see the situation for it eases the conscience and neatly shifts the responsibility from the perpetrators to the victims of that dehumanizing social wrong in their everyday language segregationists automatically always exclude negroes from their stream of american life for instance dr sullivan counts them in the population statistics of tylertown but when he speaks of having profound respect for the people of the town he is certainly not talking about the negroes who constitute nearly half of the people in like manner he excludes them when he refers to fellow townsmen mississippians clergymen and southerners such terms of reference are reserved for whites only negroes are only negroes a segregationist would never no never refer to a negro as a southerner white children in dr sullivans opinion should not have to go to school with negroes from impoverished homes which have been abandoned by the negro men do no white children come from such homes and is impoverishment a generally acknowledged social stigma in mississippi which has the lowest per capita income of any state in the union in  dr sullivan tries to justify racial segregation on such other grounds as personal uncleanliness superstition and low moral standards but those are human characteristics under certain circumstances in twentythree years of school teaching in rural arkansasa next door neighbor to mississippii often found the same things among whites are all whites of the south now above all these things what about the ones who were once commonly known as poor white trash and whose counterparts are now commonly referred to as red necks or crackers moral standards what about the moral standards of those whites who burn negro churches by the dozens coldly bomb negro children to death and wantonly murder civil_rights workers also what about white citizens and officials who condone such acts and finally what about the morality of segregation itself which is the mother of countless immoralities immorality does not belong exclusively to any particular race neither does morality besides if impoverishment personal uncleanliness and superstition were taken as the standards by which to enforce public school segregation you would have economic class segregation instead of racial segregation and class segregation was precisely what many southern aristocrats expressed a preference for when jim crow railway cars were first introduced but people are not races nor classes either they are individuals and deserve to be treated as such
the da y the world came to an end
if you havent had the  u  world coming to an end on you when youre twelve years when it happened to me it scared the living daylights and some of the joy of sinning out of me and in a lot of other ways life altogether lieve ralph mymessed up but if i am to bewaldo emersons i i got dont compensation i guess some good out of it too the calamity befell me back in old and a sinner you  we were living on a plantaknow how lucky you are tion in louisiana at the time close to the earth and god and all wrapped up in religion the church was the axis around which plantation life revolved the mother to whom the folks took their problems the teacher who taught them how the lord wanted them to live the chastiser who threatened the sinful with hell in spite of the fact that my parents were churchgoing christians i was still holding on to being a sinner not that i had anything against religion it was just a matter of integrity there was an old plantation custom that in order to be baptized into the church a sinner had to get religion a mystical experience in which the soul of the sinner was converted into christian a christian had to live upright and i knew i just couldnt come up to that on account of there were too many delicious sins around to get into but a world coming to an end can be pretty hard on a sinner the trouble began when my cousin rena came upon me playing in the watermelon patch running like the devil was behind her i was making a whole quarter of mud cabins by packing dirt over my foot in the shape of a cabin putting a chimney on top then pulling my foot out the space left by my foot formed the room of the cabin id broken some twigs off chinaberry and sycamore trees which i planted in the ground around the cabins to make trees some blooming wild flowers that negro digest august  i had picked made up a flower yard in front of each cabin it was as pretty a sight as you ever want to see before she came stepping all over everything i let her know i didnt like it real loud but she didnt pay what i said any attention she just blurted out the end of the world is coming saturday you better go get you some religion in a hurry that was on a friday afternoon getting late a picture of hell flashed across my mind but i pushed it back into the subconscious the worlds not coming to an end the confidence i tried to put in my voice failed it quaked a little who told you the world is coming to an end i heard mama and miss daya talking about it just now theres going to be an eclipse sunday you know what an eclipse is dont you i didnt know but i nodded anyhow thats when the sun has a fight with the moon if the sun whips the world goes on if the moon whips then the world comes to an end well they say that sunday the moon is going to whip the sun i wasnt going to be scared into giving up my sinning that easily how do they know the moon is going to whip i asked they read it in the almanac and its in the bible too in revelation it says in revelation that the world is supposed to end this year miss daya is a missionary sister and she knows all about things like that nobody knows anything about revelation my daddy says so i rebutted aint never been nobody born smart enough to figure out revelation since that mister john wrote it hes just going to have to come back and explain it himself she acted like she didnt hear that and reverand davis said in church last sunday that time is winding up she said hes been saying that for years now and time hasnt wound up yet thats what i know hes been saying it for years and all the while hes been saying it times been winding right along and now its just about all wound up that made sense to me and i began to consider that maybe she could be right then that miss daya happened by lord bless you down there on your knees baby pray to the lord cause its praying time i hadnt gotten up from where id been making mud cabins but i jumped up quick to let her know i wasnt praying both of you girls got religion she asked and without waiting for an answer thats good youre both big girls big enough to go to hell you all be glad you all got religion cause the lord is coming soon he said he was coming and hes coming soon and she went  on towards our cabin before i could ask her about the world ending sunday rena just stood there and looked at me awhile shaking her head in an i told you so and advised me again to get some religion in a hurry then she ran off to warn someone else although i was a sinner i was a regularchurchgoing sinner and at our church we had a hellfire preaching pastor he could paint pictures of hell and the devil in his sermons horrible enough to give a sinner a whole week of nightmares nobody with a dimes worth of sense wanted to go to a hot burning hell where a red horned devil tormented folks with a pitchfork but id been taking a chance on enjoying life another  years or so before getting some religion getting just enough to keep me out of hell i hadnt figured on time running out on me so soon and i still wasnt taking anybodys word about the world coming to an end before asking my daddy about it first but it was plowing time and daddy was way back in the corn field where id already run across a rattlesnake so i figured even the world coming to an end could wait until suppertime i went around the rest of that day with my mind loaded down now i didnt exactly believe that the world was coming to an end out i didnt exactly believe it wasnt either about two years before id went and read the worst part of revelation and it had taken my daddy two weeks to convince me that i didnt understand what i had read which still didnt keep me from having bad dreams about the moon dripping away in blood and a lot of other distressing visions aroused from misunderstood words those dreams were only a vague and frightening memory the friday im talking about and revelation an accepted mystery yet things like that have a way of sneaking back on you when you need it the least i got to supposing the world did come to an end with earthquakes and hail and fire raining down from the sky and stars falling exactly like it read in revelation and supposing the devil got after me and took me to hell like folks on the plantation said he would and supposing hell really and truly was as horrible as the preacher said it was the way the preacher told it in hell a person got burned and burned and burned and never got all burned up and died he just kept on burning burning burning with supposing like that going through it my mind was really loaded down i figured there was no use talking to mama about what was bothering me because that miss daya had stayed at our cabin for over an hour and i was sure she had convinced mama that the moon was going to whip the sun it seemed to me like it took daddy longer than ever to come negro digest august  home it was the friday of council meeting at the church and daddy a deacon had to be there i knew he wouldnt have much time to talk to me before hed have to leave out for the church so i started walking up the turnrow through the fields to meet him when i finally saw him riding towards home on his slide i ran to meet him daddy always hitched a plank under his plow to keep the plow blades from cutting up the turnrow when he came home from plowing the fields the plank which we called a slide was long enough behind the plow for him to stand on and ride home pulled by his plow horse whenever i ran to meet him hed let me ride home with him on the slide daddy i said as soon as hed put me on the slide in front of him and geed the horse to go on is the world going to come to an end sunday i dont know honey he replied why do you want to know i told him about renas prophecy that really tickled him he laughed and laughed like that was the funniest thing hed ever heard i laughed a little too though i didnt get the joke in it theres always somebody coming around prophesying that the worlds coming to an end he said after hed laughed himself out folks been doing that ever since i was a boy they were doing it when my daddy was a boy when my granddaddy was a boy aw theyve been doing that for hundreds and hundreds of years and the world is still here dont you ever pay any attention to anybody that comes around telling you the world is going to end baby but aint the world ever going to end i wanted to know yeah but dont anybody know when only the lord knows that why the world might not end for another thousand years then again it might end tonight we just dont know   tonight you mean the world might end tonight sure im not saying it will but it could a person never can tell about a thing like that but if you let that bother you why youll be scared to death every day of your life looking for the world to end youre not going to be that silly are you aw shucks no i lied i was that silly right then and there i got to looking for the world to end right there on the spot like anybody expecting a calamity i decided to sit up all night that night but mama made me go to bed my room was full of the plantation night the darkest of darkness before daddy returned from church mama put out the coal  oil lamp and went to bed the lazy old moon was on its vacation again there was no light anywhere not a speck although  my eyes couldnt see anything in that awful dark my mind had always been very good at seeing things in the dark that werent there i got to seeing how it was going to be when the world ended the whole drama of it paraded right before my mind then my imagination marched me up before the judgment seat to give account for my past sins and i tried to figure out how much burning id get for each offense counting up all the ripe plums and peaches id saved from going to waste on the neighbors trees neglecting to get the owners permission the fights id had with that sassy little catherine who lived across the river the domino games id played for penny stakes with my sinnercousin sam the times id handled the truth careless enough to save myself from a whipping and other not so holy acts i figured id be in for some real hot burning while i lay there in that pitch black darkness worrying myself sick about burning in hell a distant rumbling disturbed the stillness of the night so faint that at first i wasnt sure id heard it i sat up in the bed straining my ears listening sure enough there was a rumbling far away the rumbling wasnt thunder i was sure of that because thunder rumbled then died away but this rumbling grew louder and louder and louder a slow moving terrible loud rumbling that was to my scared mind the earth quaking the sky caving in the world ending i got out of there i got out of there fast i didnt even think about being dressed only in my nightgown or the awful dark outside being full of ghosts and bogeymen and other horrors i just ran  the world is ending the world is ending run run for your life i shouted a warning to mama and i just kept on hollering as i ran down the road past the other plantation cabins the world is ending the world is ending run run for your life doors opened and folks came out on the cabin porches some holding coal oil lamps in their hands theyd look at me in my white nightgown running down the road as fast as a scared rabbit then look up at the sky rumbling like it was caving in and a few of them hollered something at me as i passed by but i couldnt make out what any of them said i might have run myself plumb to the ocean or death if daddy and some other deacons hadnt been coming up the road on their way from church daddy caught me he had a hard time holding me though the fear of the devil and hell was stronger in me than reason i was dead set on escaping them daddy had heard my hollering about the world ending as i ran down the road towards them so he kept telling me thats just an old airplane honey the worlds not ending thats just an old airplane making all that racket when his words got through the fear that fogged my mind i calmed down a bit airplane id only heard about airplanes never had i seen one or heard one passing by daddy laughed you were just about outrunning that old airplane and keeping up almost as much racket he pointed towards the sky look up there you see its gone now see that light moving towards town thats it those old airplanes sure have scared a lot of folks with all that racket they make i looked up sure enough there was a light that looked like a star moving across the sky the rumbling was way off in the distance going away slowly like it had come and the sky was whole not a piece of it had caved in i broke down and cried because i was so relieved that the world wasnt coming to an end because id been so scared for so long because id made such a fool of myself and just because daddy pulled off his suit coat and wrapped it around me to hide the shame of my nightgown from the deacons after id had a real good cry we walked home as we walked up the ribbon of road bordering the plantation on our way home i felt a new kind of happiness inside of me the yellow squares of light shining from the black shapes of the plantation cabins outlined against the night made a picture that looked beautiful to me for the first time even the chirping of the crickets sounded beautiful like a new song id never heard before even the darkness was beautiful everything was beautiful and i was alive i felt the life within me warming me from the inside a happy feeling id never had before and the world was there all around me i was aware of it aware of all of it full of beauty full of happy things to do right then and there i was overwhelmed with a desire to live really live in the world and enjoy as much of it as i could before it came to an end and ive been doing so ever since

incident on a dus
after the demonstrations the arrests the  trials and the negotiations the city administration reluctantly agreed to desegregate the buses but the ku klux klan threatened to picketand the citizens group to boycottthe buses and jones editor told him to ride one and get the story jones entered a bus and took a seat at the back so as to have a good view of all the passengers the bus was passing through a negro area which encircled the downtown district almost half the passengers were negroes there was no tension but an air of expectancy in the bus jones realized that it was up to the negroes to integrate the bus the whites were not going to sit in the back which bore the stigma of being the worst place strange he thought in a train or an airplane the jim crow place was the front while in a bus it was the back the negroes were proceeding to integrate the bus a couple got on and sat down directly behind the driver and there were others scattered through the front and the middle they avoided sitting next to whites they sat next to each other or took vacant seats as the bus passed through skid row a little nondescript negro man got on he was the sort youd see and never remember he wore nondescript clothes and had nondescript features which youd forget as soon as you saw them he peered around for a seat saw one next to an elderly white man and sat down in it the man had been hogging his seat sitting almost in the middle perhaps to discourage any negro from sitting next to him and the new passenger had to sit half in the aisle to get more room he slid closer to the old man he did not move over but turned around and stared angrily at the negro the negro kept on pushing and leaned close against him he glared at the little man with the most virulent hate in his thin face and pale blue eyes that jones had ever seen even jones was seared with the malignancy of it hell he thought that look is enough to melt a brass monkey will that little fellow have enough guts to keep on apparently he did for he kept on pushing vigorously and pressing close to the occupant all at once the old man yielded and jerked sideways and pressed stiffly against the window his face jammed against the glass as if he were trying to move as far as possible from the hated presence of the negro well that little fellow had the nerve not to give up jones thought even though the old man is hating his guts for sitting next to him hurrah for you little man but the little man seemed not to enjoy his victory he squirmed uncomfortably on the seat he peered around furtively and after a couple of stops he scampered to the door and skipped off the bus a duncolored little mouse so timid and insignificant looking that you only half glanced at him and forgot him as soon as you saw him the old man remained in the same position jammed against the side of the bus with his face pressed against the pane he must have asked the driver to call his stop for two or three blocks farther on the driver called a street loudly and looked in his mirror at the man when he did not get up the driver walked back to him and said heres your stop he did not answer and the driver touched his shoulder bending over him he touched him again then jerked back his hand and stared at it it was red with blood jesus christ he said the man is dead 
the other pathfinder
fall the movie and tv thrillers depicting a man galloping on a fast horse lariat in hand none has ever shown a negro in that role yet in the real life of the old west a negro youth rode on one of the most famous and fastest rides on record lariat swinging his name was jacob dodson and he rode with fremont the pathfinder on the latters remarkable ride from los angeles to monterey during californias critical days of  a ride on which fremont and his two companions covered  miles of rugged country in  actual riding hours dodson was chosen for that ride because of his skill with the lariat though only  years of age he had been with fremont for four years on two great exploring expeditions to the far west in a band which included such well known frontiersmen as kit carson and thomas broken hand fitzpatrick dodson had taken part in the perilous crossing of the sierras in the winter of  and in many another adventure with that band of many nations americans delaware indians french voyageurs canadians and germans which lieutenant john charles fremont assembled to chart the west for the united states government in  fremonts party of  men had turned from exploring to seizing california from mexico in the mexicanamerican war then going on fremont held southern california with a title of provisional governor and headquarters at los angeles while general stephen kearny held the north at monterey with only a handful of americans under his command and uneasy as rumors of impending revolt flew about fremont felt an acute need to confer with kearny but was loath to leave his post for long with characteristic imagination fremont hit on a novel method for a daring fast ride north choosing as his companions his devoted friend don jesus pico a superb horseman and the equally devoted colored man jacob dodson each of the party had three horses nine in all the riders changing mounts riding on one and then another the six loose horses ran ahead without bridle or halter when wanted for a change say at a distance of twenty miles they were caught by a lasso thrown either by don jesus or jacob who  in his long expeditions with colonel fremont had become as expert as a mexican with the lasso as sure as the mountaineer with the rifle equal to either on horse or foot and always a lad of courage and fidelity according to an account in the national intelligencer of washington d c on november   it was at daybreak on the morning of the nd of march the intelligencer report continues that the party set out from los angeles    the way was over mountainous country with no other road than a trace and many defiles to pass particularly the punto gordo made by the jutting of a precipitous mountain into the sea and which can only be passed when the tide is out and the sea is calm   the towns of santa barbara and san luis obispo    were the principal inhabited places on the route    the most usual gait was a swinging gallop the first day they ran  miles passing the san fernando mountain and other mountains    the only fatigue complained of was in jacobs right arm made tired by throwing the lasso and using it as a whip to keep the loose horses to the track the next day they made another one hundred and twentyfive miles passing the formidable mountain of santa barbara and counting the skeletons of fifty horses    which perished upon it the previous christmas when fremont and the california battalion had passed that way heading south in a raging tempest    at night san luis obispo was reached the home of don jesus where an affecting reception awaited fremont  he was detained until ten oclock the following morning taking a breakfast of honor and receiving the visits of the inhabitants    here the nine horses from los angeles were replaced by fresh mounts proceeding at the usual gait that day don jesus became fatigued after seventy miles and proposed a halt in the valley of the salinas for safety from marauding indians they chose a secluded spot off the trace but their repose that night was disturbed by a stampede among the horses not due to indians but to white bears the bears were considered dangerous fremont reached for his pistols but don jesus restrained him scaring away the bears with some loud hallowing in spanish the bears went off but sleep went off also says the account in the intelligencer and the recovery of the horses frightened by the bears building a rousing fire making a breakfast from the hospitable supplies of san luis obispo occupied the party till daybreak when the journey was resumed eighty miles and the afternoon brought the party to monterey the return ride to los angeles was covered in the same way says author f s dallenbaugh in his fremont and  and fremont and his two companions rode into los angeles after leaving there a total journey of  miles over rough country in  actual riding hours by the use of  horses one of the most remarkable rides on record for speed and distance the famous ride from ghent to aix immortalized by the poet browning was barely more than the least of these eight days of fremont another biographer of fremont cardinal goodwin says if any one of the three deserved more credit than the others it was the negro dodson whose skill with the lasso kept the men provided with fresh horses jacob dodson was a freeborn negro whose family worked in lifelong service for the family of fremonts wife the bentons at the age of  he was nearly sixfeet tall and strong and active as he had watched fremont prepare in washington for his first expedition in  he had begged to go along fremont took dodson as his personal servant but the youth so quickly learned the ways of the frontier that he outgrew his classification from the first he proved his mettle fremont leaving washington for the west was traveling through the pennsylvania mountains in a stagecoach with dodson charles preuss a mapmaker for the expedition and fremonts family the driver trying to pass a long freight wagon overturned us into a gully fremont related and the coach lighted on its roof jacob who was on the box was at the horses heads before the coach reached the gully and the wagoners men prevented further harm from the frightened animals dodsons name occurs a number of times in accounts of fremonts explorations fremont encamped on the shore of the great salt lake in september  with a small select group of eight and reduced to a diet of roots while awaiting supplies related that for supper we had yampa the most agreeably flavored of the roots seasoned by a small fat duck which had come in the way of jacobs rifle next day the party explored the island in the lake now known as fremont island during the fremont partys desperate crossing of the snowcovered sierras in the dead of winter  fremont chose dodson as his companion to reconnoiter ahead of the main party down the west slope of the range fremont relates in his report of a journey and that night he tells we encamped on the headwaters of a little creek where at last the water found its way to the pacific the night was clear and very long we heard the cries of some wild animals attracted by our fire and these strange sounds had something pleasant to negro digest august  our senses in this region of silence and desolation next morning fremont and dodson followed the icy surface of the creek till it grew wider so that fremont was satisfied we had struck the stream on which mr sutter lived he was correct they had found the silver fork of the american river three weeks later on march   an advance party of eight including fremont carson and dodson arrived at sutters fort in what is now the city of sacramento genial captain john sutter must have looked with wonder upon the emaciated ragged men he met that day says morgan estergreen in his kit carson a portrait in courage they had just accomplished something which he would have sworn could not be done crossing the sierra nevada range in the depths of winter but that they had done so without loss of human life must have astonished him even more the poet john greenleaf whittier celebrated fremonts achievement in his poem the pass of the sierras so capable were the men of fremonts party said his wife jessie benton fremont later that every man was a captain a diorama of fremonts group arriving at the fort is on display at the sutters fort historical monument in sacramento dodson appears as the fourth figure from the front of the party
j n recent years a great deal of publicity has been given to  educational occupational and economic gains of negroes in the united states viewed in absolute terms these gains since the beginning of world war ii have been impressive for example the median years of school completed by nonwhites  years old and older more than  per cent of whom were negroes rose from  in  to  in  in  only  per cent of nonwhite adults had completed high school whereas  per cent had done so in  the quality of negro education also improved substantially during this period in  only  per cent of employed negro workers were in whitecollar or skilled manual occupations by  almost  per cent were employed in such work the median wage and salary income of gainfully employed nonwhite males increased threefold in constant  dollars from  in  to  in  all evidence indicates that educational occupational and economic progress is continuing substantial though these gains may be they have not been sufficient to forestall negro restiveness expressions of negro discontent if not discontent itself increased steadily although slowly from the end of world war ii to the early s and in  there was an almost explosive increase in negro protest activity the discontent that prompted this protest grew in large measure out of such conditions as segregation of public facilities housing discrimination and inequitable treatment of negroes by police but it was also due to dissatisfaction with the rate of progress in the basic spheres of education occupation and income and to a high rate of negro unemployment during a period of unparalleled prosperity a major reason for negro dissatisfaction with recent gains is that white gains have also been large and therefore there is still a sizable gap between negroes and whites although most negroes lack precise knowledge of this gap they perceive that it remains large and several recent trends have sharpened the negros perception of his relative disadvantage and made him more prone to measure his condition against that of whites for instance skilled and whitecollar occupations and good education have given many negroes a better vantage point from which to judge their relative condition and negroes who have moved from allnegro to interracial social circles have often experienced a decline in relative status and a heightened sense of deprivation more casual and stylized contacts such as in the classroom and on the job have had a similar effect on the experiencing of relative deprivation increased travel and greater exposure to the mass media of communications have also given negroes more knowledge of the life styles and consumption patterns of middleclass white americans and have widened the disparity between negro aspirations and attainments therefore if negro aspirations are to be satisfied and negro discontent stilled there must be a marked closing of the gap between negroes and whites not merely large absolute negro gains the prospects for such a closing in the near future are not good unless the convergence of negroes and whites in education occupations and income is greatly accelerated an appreciable gap will remain throughout the lifetime of most negroes now living this can be seen by projecting recent rates of convergence at the to rates of change in the relative standing of negroes they would attain equality with whites in education long before they would attain equality in occupation and income but even the education gap as indicated by the ratio of nonwhite to white median years of school completed would not close until the year  and the income gap as measured by the ratio of nonwhite to white median family income would not close until  negro males would become proportionally represented in most intermediatelevel occupations within a few decades but would not attain equality in some upperlevel occupations for centuries negroes are considered to be proportionally represented in an occupation if the percentage of negroes is the same in the occupation and in the total labor force in a few occupationsincluding physicians and surgeons and managers officials and proprietorsnegro representation did not increase at all during the s and therefore equality cannot be projected at any rate the projected dates for proportional representation in a few selected occupations are as follows these projections are not predictions they merely say that if the rate of progress in the recent past were continued it will take a very long time for negroes to catch up with whites negro income and occupational gains are likely to accelerate so that income equality and roughly proportional representation in the upperlevel occupations will be attained in less than the time indicated on the other hand negroes almost certainly will not gain educational equality with whites by the above projected date of a conclusion we reach from an analysis of data on educational attainment by age since most people do not receive formal education after about age  but will live and influence the educational statistics for many more years educational equality in the total population probably will not be attained until four or five decades after it is attained among young adults and the educational gap between negroes and whites in this age range from  through  remained substantial in  at the recent rate of change the gap will not disappear for this age group for three or four decades nearly a century probably will pass before there is equality in the total population in addition to the gap in the quantity of negro and white education there is a vast difference in the quality of education the average year of negro schooling is far less than the equivalent of the average white year in terms of the skills and knowledge that result from it in many localities negro pupils average only as well on scholastic achievement tests as whites two or three grade levels below them although there is no good overall measure of the difference in quality we can be fairly certain that it like the gap in years of school completed is slowly closing there has been appreciable desegregation of schools and colleges in the border states during the past decade and the southern states have at least improved the physical facilities of their negro schools in an attempt to lessen pressure for desegregation however it is not likely that the gap in quality of education is closing as rapidly as the gap in quantity de facto segregation based upon residential segregation has increased recently in some northern and western cities and the predominantly negro schools pervaded with a lowerclass culture and usually poorly staffed and equipped almost invariably offer inferior opportunities to learn and stimulate less incentive to do so although there is now little overt discrimination against negroes by northern and western colleges and universities negro college students handicapped by poor backgrounds and limited financial resources are highly concentrated in institutions with low academic standards even so a large percentage of them do not fare well in competition with their white classmates and almost  per cent of the nonwhite males who complete one year of college never complete four the comparable percentage for white males is less than  it seems therefore that some difference in the average quality of negro and white education is likely to remain for some time after the gap in years of school completed is closed true educational equality is probably more than a century away even if recent favorable trends continue and are accelerated by the belated efforts of governments and foundations to correct longrecognized deficiencies there is still considerable discrimination against negroes in employment and in rates of pay but such discrimination has been declining rapidly since no overall measure of discrimination is available one cannot determine the exact rate of decline but if the present rate continues discrimination may virtually disappear within a short time except in isolated black belt areas of the south if this is so the occupational and income gaps will close as soon as educational equality is attained employment opportunities are already opening more rapidly than negroes can become qualified to take advantage of themespecially in some professional and technical occupations in which a scarcity of qualified personnel of any race makes it impractical for employers to discriminate or in which conspicuous employment of negroes is considered good public relations by the corporation government agency or university since there is more discrimination in most other kinds of occupations especially in the skilled trades discrimination remains an important obstacle to negro advancement the craft unions of the skilled building trades for example use well established techniques of nepotism and maintain an artificial shortage of workers thus effectively obstructing the hiring of negroes among the potential workers however low average negro occupational qualificationsthe result of centuries of past subordinationare now a greater hindrance than current discrimination in most occupations the persistent income gap the slow but steady closing of the educational gap and the more rapid decline in discrimination have not led to a convergence of negro and white incomes the reason is a growing gap between the incomes of well educated and poorly educated workers regardless of race for instance in  males with only one to four years of formal schooling had a median income  per cent of that of males with four or more years of college whereas by  this percentage had declined to  underlying this change was a widening of the income gap between unskilled workers and professional technical and managerial workersa change growing from automation and other technological developments which increased demand for the highly trained and decreased demand for the unskilled and untrained a much larger percentage of negroes than of whites are still poorly educated and unskilled and the decline in the relative status of these negroes almost completely offset the economic advancement of the minority of negroes who became well educated the widening of the chasm between the opportunities and economic conditions of poorly educated and well educated workers is continuing and perhaps accelerating as a consequence negroes must gain steadily on whites in education and occupational status merely to stay the same distance behind in income there is likely to be enough automation during the next decade or so to make it hard for negroes to keep up and the income gap could widen appreciably the impact of automation any widening of the income gap will necessarily impede negro efforts to catch up in education and could postpone the attainment of educational equality well beyond the projection we give above and any slowing of the convergence of negro and white educational status will in turn tend to widen the income gap consequently the imminent prospects of widespread automation give great urgency to efforts to improve negro education and occupational qualifications if negro education is not improved rapidly enough negroes as a whole are faced for many decades of underprivilege and inferior status after the discrimination that has kept them down for so long is practically eliminated as automation replaces discrimination as the major force keeping negroes near the bottom of the social heap negro efforts to attain equality must change the battle against discrimination may soon be won but if negroes try to impede automation their efforts will be futile even labor leaders who feel their unions have much to lose are fighting delaying actions and playing for time and concessions they do not think it possible to obstruct automation for very long the most rational future strategy to raise negro status would be a program of uplift and selfimprovement necessarily with the massive support of government foundations and all kinds of educational institutions from the standpoint of negroes a shift away from emphasis upon protest to such a program may not come easily negroes are marshalled to fight discrimination they increasingly focus their hostility upon whites and they can release their pent up hostility in protest activities they will find it hard to turn their attention upon themselves and settle down to the long arduous and unexciting tasks of uplift whites whose consciences are being eased by the elimination of the more flagrant forms of discrimination may not readily give the sustained support and cooperation needed for an adequate program of negro uplift not many whites are likely to feel responsible either for the technological changes that are lowering the economic status of the poorly educated or for the past discrimination that has left negroes concentrated in this downwardly mobile segment of society in short neither recent trends in negro status nor the potentialities of the methods now being used for negro advance lead us to expect a rapid closing of the gap between negroes and whites only a massive program of education job retraining and occupational upgradingon a scale far greater than any program now proposed by negro leaders the federal government or any organization concerned with negro improvement can save the majority of negroes from many more decades of inferior status such programs of the presidents war on poverty as the job corps and operation head start are a step in the right direction and not a small one but much greater efforts are needed 
upon picking up dr mordechai kreinins israel and africa a study in technical cooperation columbia i was impressed with the price of the book  i immediately became interested in what the publishers thought was contained within the  pages appendix included that would demand such a price here is what i found the book is about rather specialized and technical problems without all of the weightiness of technical and specialized language it is not intended for general reading but the general public can read and understand it it is written by a scholar who displays his scholarship through the manner in which he simplifies rather than complicates the subject matter the substance of the book revolves around the ways and means in which israel can aid africa in the latters struggle for economic and social growth but more than that it gives reasons why israeli aid and assistance has certain advantages over aid from other countries as well as the negative aspects that may also exist for example he points out that aid from israel does not mean that the recipient country is getting involved in the power struggle between east and west there is an element of kinship due to the fact that both africans and jews have had tragic pasts there are several more aspects that make it most desirable for africans to get israeli aid but the one that holds the greatest import as i see it is the fact that africans who come to israel for study tours and conferences see the political and social leaders often roll up their sleeves and get very much involved in manual labor the aversion that the african leader often displays for manual labor has two very real foundations first the old tribal and traditional customs have the women doing most of the manual labor the man reserves his energy for the essential task of hunting second under the colonial powers it was the undermen not the leaders who performed tasks of manual labor it is natural then that the african leaders should want to continue in this tradition and fashion but what africa needs is everv available ounce of talent it has  to apply itself to the problems facing i it and when the most talented men are reluctant to pitch in for fear of doing something beneath them then it is advantageous for them to be exposed to any system that will help to alter this unfortunate trait in the african makeup perhaps none of the above is really very original startling or sensational but it is useful and compiled in a logical easy reading style it makes interesting reading for those who have an especially strong interest in african development africa must emulate israel in certain crucial areas of improvement many of these are very candidly but gently pointed out the book bears the mark of a scholar and that is rare in these days of mass production of books
the confederate general of the title is not a character in this book by richard brautigan a confederate general from big sur grove press  but is supposed to be the great grandfather of one lee mellon who meets the narrator jesse on a spree after he has hit a rich queer on the head with a rock and has taken his car his watch and his money later jesse visits lee in his primitive cabin on big sur and the rest of the book is taken up with their attempts to find food money tobacco and lays the reader of this book is reminded of an oldtime vaudeville comedian who feels the audience is getting bored and who says damn whereupon everyone laughs only this time the performer says damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn so often that there is no response mr brautigan uses so many fourletter words that they become as meaningless as the circumambient profanity of the army he seems to write whatever comes first to the top of his head and what comes out is sometimes meaningless sometimes inane and sometimes a nice simile or metaphor the characters are zany like those in comic strips the book is froth and like the fiction of ladies magazines is to be read in a summer hammock or in bed when you cant go to sleep and then be forgotten 
in the black anglosaxons marzani  munsell  sociologist nathan hare carries on a contention begun several years ago by the late e franklin frazier black bourgeoisie essentially it boils down to a  conviction that assimilation into american life has cost the middle class negro his racial identity rendering him a cheap sterile and selfdespising imitation with an approach reminiscent of the late dr fraziers personal anecdotes hearsay erratic news items dr hare examines his subject from several points of viewthe mimics the imagemakers the cultured the supercitizens etc if this is supposed to provide dimension it simply doesnt come off for the book is singularly shallow undocumented and often embarrassingly distorted it has taken what may be an interesting subject of investigation and given it the depth and scholarship of a gossip column in a chapter titled the exiles for example the author states because they failed to gain equality as members of a race they seek to abolish that race integration becomes synonymous with disintegration of the negro they operate on the pathetic assumption that the sooner they forget that they are negroes the sooner the whites will also this raises all kinds of interesting questions among them whether or not there is such a thing as a preexistent american negro culture and whether terms like negritude and blackness which presumably link all negroes together in some sort of mysterious bond even wedding them to distant africa have any validity instead of answering the questions however dr hare devotes the entire chapter to a series of gossipy tidbits describing how horrible it was that a certain dancer quit langston hughes stage revue in objection to its title black nativity and condemning althea gibson for insisting in a magazine article that she not be referred to as a negro tennis player many of his observations are indisputable as when he bemoans the middle classs conspicuous consumption antiintellectualism etc others are patently absurd when a group of howard university coeds confess they were thrilled at shaking hands with robert kennedy dr hare at tributes their enthusiasm to his kennedys whiteness he becomes so enamored of his theme that he extends it to include middle class negro speech eating habits and even the kinds of names parents choose for their offspring but as sociologist oliver c cox points out in a rather stabilizing introduction as a population either negro or white moves from lower to middle class status it surrenders one subculture and takes on another thus it should not be conceived of as being cultureless and rootless in the process    the culture of negro americans is not an immemorial heritage of the race but rather a version of western culture and that romanticized folk tradition so mourned by the frazierhare school of commentators was and still is a largely illiterate extremely inefficient instrument of modern life it is not an ideal toward which negro americans can be expected to reverthamilton bims  cycle of indebtedness exploitation and desperation is repeated each year within yelling distance of major centers of culture and the twentieth century like miami philadelphia new york and other eastern seaboard cities the other outstanding feature of the book is that it is exactly what the foreword and introduction state it to be it is    the migrants own storya story that needs telling    this report is rather an amplification of the migrants own faint cries they are cries of bitterness resentment unhappiness the futility of existence cut off from the rest of humanity wright has done just that he has amplified and articulated the cries of the migrant worker so that their voices have been heard in the highest places in the land thankfully there is now just the faintest hope that more legislation will join the little that is already on the books to help the migrant worker extract himself from the quicksand of exploitation but equally as important is the fact that as senator harrison a williams states in the introduction it is heartening to know that courageous reporters like mr wright still serve as active gadflies to americas conscience his moving plea should be read by every american    with a recommendation from such a high place that drips with obvious truth is there need to say morebrooks johnson  there will never be another mississippi summer project the conditions of a state crippled by a ravaging history together with the idealism of the young people who chanced death to open its closed doors is captured in letters from mississippi mcgrawhill  edited by elizabeth sutherland damn it i dont want to go i just  want to know the best way to do it    written from the oxford ohio training camp in june is typical of the almost frightening honesty contained in the letters and excerpts written by the summer volunteers although the amazing introspection of the students is the heart of the book the book is also a complete catalogue of the summer project from oxford to the magnolia state to the atlantic city convention and back to their northern homes the reader journeys with the students mississippi life through the eyes of those who became mississippians for a summer is shared with the reader and the reader also shares the letter writers abounding love for humanity and equally abounding hatred of evil in reading letters from mississippi one perceives the difference between the sympathy of the liberals and the empathy of those who chose to explore the depths of life while experiencing the taste of death the letters provide heretofore unpublished insights about bob moses he forced you by what he said and by his manner of saying it to want to partake of him to come to him he was not in any way outgoing yet when he spoke you felt close to him the young man who was largely responsible for the creativity of the summers endeavor one is reminded that these students led a nation last summer forcing it to see its crimes their spirit challenges the more cynical among us their concern is captivating and however despairing one might be letters from mississippi makes one recognize that the nation has produced at least one group of young people who are somehow larger and greater than the nation much has been written about the students sacrifice last summer in getting to know them one is aware of an even larger sacrifice that this nation will have to make if their idealism is not to be in vain
